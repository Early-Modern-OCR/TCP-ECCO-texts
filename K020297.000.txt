TONSON in the Strand, and T. LOWNDS in Fleet-street.M DCC LXV.To Mrs. JANE STEAD.MADAM,ONE of the most valuable Privileges of Friendship, is that of carrying on an Intercourse unsubjected to the Slavish Ties of Form and Ceremony; which one I claim, for addressing You thus unexpectedly—and whatever delicate Pain You may suffer from Surprize, You are too generous, I am sure, not to allow another the Advantage of that Liberty, which You are so fond of Yourself.To whom should an Author of slender Abilities fly for Countenance, but to the Great or Good?—Fortune has denied me the Advantage of the former, but has made me ample Amends in the latter. So sensibly do I feel this, that, were my Production equal to that of the first Poet's in the Age,

I could never think it more highly graced, than by this Opportunity of acknowledging my having known one of the best Women in the World; and that I shall always be (with warmest Wishes for her enjoying many, many Years of Happiness)Her sincere Friend, and most grateful, and affectionate humble Servant, THOMAS HULLLondon, Jan. 1, 1765.Dramatis Personae.MEN.POMPEY, Mr. Giustinelli.ATHRIDATES, Mr. Champnes.PHARNACES, Mr. Vernon.GILADES, Mrs. Dorman.CHILD, Miss Rogers.Priests, Guards, &c.WOMEN.TAMIRIS, Mrs. Vincent.SELINDA, Miss Slack.PHARNACES.ACT I.
