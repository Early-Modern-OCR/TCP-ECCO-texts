WILLIAM PITT, &c. &c.By Mr. JONES, Author of the Earl of ESSEX.To which is added, the PRUSSIAN CAMPAIGN, A POEM.Celebrating The ATCHIEVEMENTS of FREDERICK the GREAT, in the Years 1756—57.By WILLIAM DOBSON, L.L.B.LONDON, Printed, and DUBLIN: Re-printed for WILLIAM WHITESTONE, opposite Dick's-Coffee-House in Skinner-Row. 1758.THE PATRIOT ENTERPRIZE.ONE Briton yet asserts that aweful name,One Patriot yet supports the glorious theme!Amidst Corruption's flood still spotless seen,A heart still faithful, and a hand still clean.Assist him, Seraphs, stoop from heav'n ye fewThat once were Patriots, once were firm and trueTo Britain's cause, ye kindred Spirits glow,Descend, and shield him in this storm below;Your shelt'ring wings around his virtue spread,Inspire his heart, and crown with wreaths his head;With gleams of Heav'n's pure light his soul array,And all the glories of the Just displayFull in his sight; parental Heroes smile;His virtue aid—O snatch from fate this Isle;Point out the paths you trod, the arms you bore,Bid Truth return, and ancient worth restore;Let Britain lift once more her laurel'd headAbove the waves, and strike the world with dread.Thou, PITT, this verse with patient soul attend,Her buckler, sword, her guardian, and her friend;Whose stedfast heart no virtuous toil can tire,Whose tongue is touch'd with Heav'n's resistless fire,In Heav'ns own injur'd cause supreme to shineWith dazzling force, with splendors all divine.Thou Man belov'd! thy country's boast and choice,To whom afflicted millions lift their voice,Thou last remaining champion of the state,On thee Integrity and Wisdom wait,Still lift thy dreaded arm, still, still pursueThe monstrous Python, and his pois'nous crew;
Repeat each righteous blow, repeat each wound,And bring the bloated Hydra to the ground:Lo earth, and sea, and heav'n shall then rejoice,In one triumphant Paean lift their voice.The marks of gratitude, ye Britons, pay,And strew with thankful wreaths the Patriot's way;Let breathing brass, let feeling stone confess,Whilst arches bend, and story'd piles expressTo ages yet unborn the glorious Man,His falling country's prop, whose godlike planOn curs'd Corruption trod, on Faction fell,Who drives th' infernal monsters back to hell,Spurning their gilded bait—who strikes down Fraud,At home our bosom pest, our bane abroad,That sap'd the vitals of our sinking pow'r,When hungry Vengeance urg'd the rip'ning hour:Then stood forth PITT, unaided and alone,The People's friend, yet faithful to the Throne;Trampling on British bribes with Roman scorn,Another TULLY for his country born,To counterwork each villain's dark designs,For Britain too may dread her CATILINES:He comes exulting in a heart sincere,A tongue that strikes Corruption's soul with fear;An arm still ready to redress the causeOf Majesty oppress'd, or injur'd Laws;Like CECIL bold in Virtue's sacred might,Like HAMPDEN glorious, when restrain'd by right,Like FAULKLAND servid for his country's good,No pride provokes, no faction fires his blood;For Britain's lasting weal his wishes glow,His Patriot heart see pant, his blood see flow:Embrace him, Britain, to thy bosom pressOne Patriot Son, long, long that Son possess.O quickly come, thou Genius that sustainsOf Britain's ancient worth the small remains,O quickly come, and kindle up those firesWith Freedom's breath that warm'd our godlike sires;
The bless'd occasion snatch, perhaps the last,And round your liberties a rampart cast,That shall, like Nature's laws, remain entire,Till Virtue darkens and the stars expire;Th' immortal task begin; see Virtue rise,And lift her glorious flag to Britain's eyes;Leaning on PITT her dreaded sword she draws,Whilst angels trumpet wide th' eternal cause:See panting millions to her standard crowd;See Truth assert, see Faith proclaim aloudThe grand behest—from heav'n the sound is spread(Whilst crush'd Integrity uprears her head.)Britons, be honest to yourselves, be just,In this unblemished man repose your trust;PITT the firm phalanx forms with manly pride,Integrity his shield, and Truth his guide;See, see each venal pest before him fly,Shrink from his voice, and shudder at his eye;Such heav'n-fraught powers appal the guilty soul,Where vengeance lightens, and where thunders roll;Dreadful he marches on, and void of fear,With Fortitude his front, with Worth his rear;With every virtue see his soul supply'd,With Loyalty, with Honour near his side;Auxiliars worthy of a cause design'dTo rescue Nature's right in human kind:From venal leprosy to purge the land,And all the taints of soul Corruption's hand;To push the barrier back that Freedom braves,To mark the bounds of subjects, not of slaves,To call up British honesty once more,And ev'ry virtue to its reign restore.Ye Britons join with heart, with voice unite,'Tis Wisdom calls you forth, and native Right;Let future deeds your present crimes efface,Your fleets and armies that bring back disgrace,Council's o'erthrown by Caution's ghastly dreams,Orders rejected, unattempted schemes;
O biot—for ever blot the hateful page,Quick cancel, Time, the ignominious ageFrom out thy records —See, a train appears!Of British worthies, and of glorious years!See Time (by Virtue led) o'er Albion smile,Returning Justice bless once more the isle;Exulting Commerce issuing from the main,And Britain's thunder shake the poles again:See Truth ascend her adamantine throne,Despotic Truth, eternal, and alone;Parent of Wisdom, whose unbounded swayThe Virtues bend to and the Worlds obey;Great queen of harmony, whence order springs,Whose moral scepter rules the hearts of kings,Before thy throne with Concord's emblems grac'd,See all the Virtues in their order plac'd:Hail, sacred Truth, O stretch thy ancient reignO'er Britain's kindred isle, call back againHer golden age of plenty, pow'r and wealth,Her honour, temperance, fortitude and health,Her justice, courage, conquest and renown,Let tyrants start, and tremble at her frown,New brace her arm, her trident's strength restore,Hark! hark! her thunder shakes yon hostile shore;Around the globe her dreaded flag display,Let ocean's utmost bounds her flag obey;Her crimson cross invincible let flyAbove the waves, triumphant in the sky.'Tis done; see direful Fraud, see Discord bound,See hell-born Faction gasping on the ground,See bloated Luxury with famish'd jaws,See curs'd Corruption with her gilded claws,See pois'nous Perfidy with patriot air,See venal Villainy, see mad Despair,A ghastly groupe! in fell confusion lieBeneath thy aweful frown, O Truth, and die.The caverns yawn, the rocky bars give way,See Genius burst her bands, and spring to day,
Spurning the cave, accurs'd Corruption's cell,Where Envy broods, where venal vapours dwell,Thy bane, O Truth; see, see, she joyful soars,She drinks th' etherial ray, she high exploresHer native heav'n, by Virtue's hand set freeShe gains new strength, her piercing eye shall seeWith tenfold force where Wisdom's secrets lieBeneath th' abyss, above the starry sky;Through Nature's works her mimic hand shall playWhere Freedom prompts, where Virtue points the way:Ambition there to blameless heights shall rise,There guiltless Glory gain th' immortal prize;See Sculpture rear her life-creating hand,See thinking stone on story'd basis stand;There classic piles attract the wond'ring ken,Here Genius dips the pencil and the pen;In kindred lights with friendly ray shall shineA MASON's muse, a HAYMAN's groupe divine,Unrival'd lov'd; see HOGARTH's fancy reignIn BUTLER's rich, unborrow'd matchless vein;Through blissful scenes the raptur'd mind shall rove,New POPES shall sing, new LAMBERTS paint the grove:Did PHIDIAS there indent the magic steel?Did ROUBILIAC instruct the rocks to feel?A HUDSON's teint, by beauty's beam refin'd,Shall through th' expansive features call the mind;Nature and Art their utmost pow'r shall shew,And SHAKESPEARS yet unborn, and GARRICKS glow.The Arts exult at Virtue's great commandWith Taste, with Liberty in either hand;Triumphant Britain smiles, near, near each sideSee native Honesty, see native Pride,With Grecian worth, with Roman bent to vye,Fame at her heart, and Glory in her eye,With ancient Rome in her MAECENAS' days,When Judgment gave, when Genius wore the bays,With both shall Britain now maintain the strife,To lift up nature and to polish life.
Be hence thy high concern, be hence thy care,From Gallia's haughty brow provok'd to tearThe rival wreaths; a twofold empire gain,Science at land, and conquest on the main.By both MINERVAS crown'd, O Britain, shine,Let learning still, let conquest still be thine;Let courage, taste, and truth thy sons adorn,Let BACONS yet, let MARLBOROUGHS yet unborn,For arts and arms above mankind rever'd,By Europe honour'd, and by Europe fear'd,Expand the circles of thy vast renown;Let PITT, let Virtue wear the immortal crown.THE PRUSSIAN CAMPAIGN, A POEM: CELEBRATING The ATCHIEVEMENTS OF FREDERICK the GREAT, In the Years 1756—57.By WILLIAM DOBSON, LLB.LONDON: Printed, and DUBLIN Re-printed for WILLIAM WHITESTONE, in Skinner-Row.TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE, Lord Viscount CHARLEMONT, PATRON Of Literature, Sciences, and Arts, This Poem is Inscribed: An unworthy Testimony Of truly affectionate and indeliable Gratitude From his Sincerest Friend WILLIAM DOBSON.THE PRUSSIAN CAMPAIGN, &c.A PRINCE, unrival'd in puissant deeds,Of noblest prowess and unconquer'd soul,I sing; and with ambition lyre this verseAttune the mighty FRED'RICK's honour'd name.Bless'd, while my CHARL'MONT his propitious earInclines, attentive to the glorious theme:How amply bless'd, if, by the Bard invok'dSo oft, descending Health her genial balmWould round thee pour benign, rekindling fairThy roseate bloom, thou amiable Youth,Crown'd with each virtue, with each grace adorn'd!O that a ray of the celestial flame,That erst illum'd the animated Bard,(Who sung of Eden, and o'er Eden's bow'rsHigh-soaring, trac'd th' embattel'd SeraphimIn fiery conflict on th' ethereal plains,)Beam'd on this breast: that I might swift pursueThro' every vast design, thro' every highEmprize, the great, th' inimitable Chief.The Muse, in various raptures sweetly lost,This shining path, and that, by turns surveys,Bewilder'd; unresolv'd, th' advent'rous taskWhere to begin; which splendor first, which last,To celebrate in song: his matchless might,His martial discipline exact, or kindIndulgence to the Brave; his active soul
Rapt with fierce fury, thro' the glorious field,Or steddiest counsels, and deliberate care.But hark! the trumpet's clangor rends the sky,And the loud clarions sound the voice of war.Forth issue Prussia's troops, in various bands;While these to Leipsic's walls their rapid marchDirect, those to proud Dresden's royal tow'rs.When lo, th' impetuous monarch in just ireArose, and with unerring clue pursuedThe wily labyrinths of th' ambitious foe,By keen perception trac'd: and all their darkDevice, and machinations dire, disclos'd.Near thrice three circling years his generous SoulHad cultivated peace, whose studious artsOf peace, and martial deeds alike expert.When rous'd at length his wrath, with various cloudsFrom various climes beset, the perilous stormSoon as he saw concentring from afar,Furious he flew; and borne on swiftest wing,Pierc'd the perfidious Saxon's inmost realms.At FREDERICK'S dread advance, the tim'rous PoleInstant the court, the capital deserts,Leaves his afflicted consort, bath'd in tears,Disconsolate; and speeds with eager courseHis martial pow'rs to Pirna's close retreats:Pirna, whose strong-fenc'd camp access defy'd,Proud of high battlements and ramparts vast,Fort above fort, impenetrably firm.As when the tow'ring Eagle soars the skie,Sublime, in numerous flocks th'aerial trainSpeed their swift flight to many a winding cellDeep in the caverns of some craggy rock,Cleft by Time's rigid hand; there pant immur'd,With shuddring wings.—Mean time the vigilant ChiefThree several hosts their several charge assign'd;There to secure Silesia's plains, and hereHis native realms defend, should Russia pourTh' unnumber'd legions from her fertile loins.
Himself the Saxon troops, as couch'd they layWrapt in the bosom of their shelt'ring camp,Nor daring to the field, with pow'rful forceInvests, on every hand environ'd round.Yet still the generous Prince his ire repress'd:And while th' avenging sword his arm display'd,That stretch'd the gentle olive forth, fair pledgeOf amicable peace. The Pole that pledgeDisdain'd, thro' Austrian's vaunted aid, secure.Forthwith, from every circle, stem decrees,Loud-echoing mandates, comminations dire,Fraught with each pompous circumstance of wrath,Pour through the Empire, levelling their rageAt mighty Brandenburgh. In furious tidesRussia rolls down her thund'ring menaces:Whom thy vain insolence, superb Versailles,Thy haughty taunts succeed. He unappall'dWith ample breast receives th' united storm:Firm, as the stately promontory's heightErect, by surges lash'd on every side,Foaming redundant on the big-swoln main:His elevated brow o'er the mad wavesRears it's dread honors, and disdains their roar.Now while the Saxons with their hapless PrinceClung to the trenches, and the fort embrac'd,In deep despair involv'd' no succour nigh,Exhausted, spiritless, by Prussian troopsEncompass'd sore: at length th' auxiliar hostFrom Austria's land in numerous squadrons move,Led by their mightiest ChieftainCount Brown.. Swift they march.As swift great FREDERICK (whose quick-darting eyeNo hostile motion scap'd) his troops to joinHastes, where experienc'd KEITH his standard rear'dAll in a moment tow'ring in the van,Of choice battalions form'd, to Tournitz's wallsHe drives his rapid way. Thither anon
March his whole host, in two main columns rang'd,Obsequious to his high behests. Nor staidTh' impatient Heroe, till Welmina's plainsHe reach'd: thence to his view at once appear'dAustria's vast pow'rs, from wing to wing display'd.E'er yet the parting Sun his western goalAttain'd, light's scant remains the vigorous ChiefSeiz'd, and explor'd the plains, whence to assailThe foe at earliest dawn. The night's long stageHis troops the rigour of th' inclement skyWith hearts unchill'd endure. He in the front,Pre-eminent in danger and in toil,Unmindful of repose, his list'ning bandsIncessant animates: with liveliest cheer,And with endearing accents fires their souls."My glorious partners in the bold emprizeOn many a well-fought field: in me your friend,In me your fire behold. The morning sun,(Or my presages err) shall see the plainsWith Austrian corses strown. Myself shall shareEach perilous attempt, each brave exploitWitness, and amply recompence. PursueYon path, where glory, where your country's loveInvites, and Pruassia's still unsullied fame.Thus while he spake, th'invigorated troopsGlow with fresh fire, and feel the gen'rous flameGlance thro' their thrilling veins: the loit'ring SunThey chide, impatient, panting for the field.Scarce blush'd the morn with streaks of orient day;FREDERICK up-sprung: with his attendant ChiefsLed forth the valiant troops: their various bandsIn strong battalions regularly ranged;Line after line, and file succeeding file;Here the right wing display'd, and there the left,Each on a tow'ring hill. In order dueOnward they march: when in broad front appearAustria's equestrian bands, array'd for war."Advance (said mighty Brandenburgh) advance;
Rush to the plains, and Horse to Horse oppose.Swift they descend, and with impetuous forceBurst on the foe: when from the hostile rearSudden the latent enginry disgorge,Hurl'd from their brazen throats, the flaming ballsInnumerable: at the dire din alarm'dAnd storms of thund'ring metal, back they bendTheir not imprudent steps: then form'd afresh,To the brisk charge return. Now nor the roarOf bellowing cannon, nor incessant fire,Nor wide-extended dyke, nor obvious moundRetard: with furious onset the fierce steedsAnd their dismounted warriors down they trod,In groans expiring, welt'ring in their gore,In heaps on mangled heaps o'erthrown: nor ceas'd,Till undistinguish'd sunk th' imperial Horse,All sunk, in universal ruin whelm'd.Forthwith, down-rushing from the mountain's brow,FREDERICK's fierce Infantry, with furious speedThro' iron tempests and thro' floods of fire,To Low' schatz's walls intrepid flew, assail'dWith unresisted force, th' astonied foeRepell'd, and from their boasted fortress drove,With rout on rout confounded. The fell strokeVienna's General mourns, his scattered hostDriving precipate to Budin's plains.FREDERICK, triumphant on the foughten fieldStands, and surveys the soil, with thousands slain,And thousands wide o'erspred whose nobler doomThe captive warriors envy and admire.Amid the ill-star'd train, gall'd at his fate,Undaunted Lobkowitz' superior tow'rsWith clouded aspect and indignant mien.Hail, mighty Prussia, hail! With eagle wing,Hov'ring around thee, Victory attendThey every march! — Beneath the hallow'd shadeRest thee awhile: thy noble toil suspend:Deign o'er thy brows to bind this laurel wreath,
Th'ambitious Muse with pleasing labour wove.How did thine heart exult, when thou surveyd'stThy daring legions, by thy conduct fir'd,And all thy emulous Chiefs: above those ChiefsHigh-blazing, as the peerless Star, that leadsTh'ethereal host o'er the wide azure pour'd,Resplendent train! Next thee, great BEVERN shoneSublime, and darted terror on the foe,Reflecting his illustrious Monarch's rays.Nor, valiant MULLER, shall thy prowess passUnsung; who with resistless might dispers'dTh'embattel'd ranks, like clouds of sleeting sandDriv'n by th'impetuous whirlwind's rapid wing.With these, the tribute of th'applauding bardUnnumber'd heroes claim, whose various deedsWere long to trace. The gen'rous FREDERICK's loveShall crown their merits, and their glorious namesLive in the records of immortal fame.Thence to the Saxon bands, in Pirna's fortImmur'd, he wings his way, bent to subdueThat treach'rous foe. Nor long, e'er from the campTh'imprison'd squadrons start, o'er Egra's streamsFrom the bridg'd path, while sable Night resum'dHer reign alternate, and th'incumbent mistsSpred o'er heaven's face impenetrable gloom,Deep'ning the wonted shades. How vain th'attempt!Their wiles how frustrate! The vast summit's height,Fronting thy turrets, Koningstein, with marchLaborious as they climb, th'uprising sunShew'd them to PRUSSIA's view; whose strong defilesEnclos'd them round. What gleam of hope remains?Where shall they fly? how force th'obstructed way?Aghast, and thunder-struck, th'obdurate KingHis high-swoln pride submits, in suppliant termsSues for that peace he insolently scorn'd.Thus quell'd proud Austria, and th'ambitious PoleFlung from his tow'ring hopes, the wint'ry storms,On blustring Boreas and bleak Eurus' wings
Rushing impetuous, with malignant blastsWarn to retire from forth the tented field.His troops th' indulgent Chief, albeit inur'dTo each severe extreme, his well-lov'd troopsWithdraws, and to his Saxon camp retires.Soon as the balmy Zephyrs' earliest galesLed on the genial spring, great FREDERICK's breastFraught with deep counsels in still silence form'd,Sudden unfolds. His ev'ry valiant bandInstant he summons: at his great commandTheir tacit march they speed; and swift attainBohemia's realm, three formidable hosts.This the fam'd BEVERN, that brave SCHWERIN led;The third their Monarch's fav'rite conduct boasts.War soon resumes his flaming torch. — AgainImperial Austria's congregated pow'rs.Appear, in numerous squadrons firmly rang'd,A mighty host: and KONINGSEGG commands.Deep was their rear entrench'd; by village wallsTheir right was shelter'd, by impervious woodsEncompass'd the left wing. Yet not the lessBEVERN impetuous drove his rapid bands,By every valiant Chieftain well sustained;Storm'd the strong cover, thro' th' intrenchments rush'd,And pierc'd their dense array. In sudden routAll their vast cavalry involv'd the FoeAstonish'd views: while gallant LESWITZ springsFierce and undaunted 'mid the hostile fire,Swift flies thro' many a perilous defile,And with dread chase pursues the timorous host,(Havoc and ruin marching in their rear)From hill to hill in wild confusion driv'n.To join thee, BEVERN, bends his eager courseIntrepid SCHWERIN, to thy soul endear'dBy kindred Virtue's ever sacred tie.Him to ensnare, within cover'd daleLurks the secreted foe, a numerous band!Soon their insidious wiles the wary chief
Espied; encounter'd, and discomfited.Thence his impetuous progress onward rollsWide o'er the land, unbounded, uncontroll'd,With torrent force. Before his fiery swordOn every hand they scour, nor dare confrontHis mighty rage: inactive, down they throwTheir unavailing arms. The regions roundBend to the victor, and confess his sway.Now mighty FRED'RICK with observant kenSaw, where the foe their various squadrons drewFrom the tow'rd fortress, and each banner'd host;Rang'd in proud pomp beneath their mightiest Chief,Who from the terror of dread PRUSSIA's armSo late retreated, with sad overthrowGall'd on Welmina's memorable plains:Yet dares again, by conscious valour fir'd.Again his thundring arm dread PRUSSIA rears.Impatient of delay, with instant marchO'er Moldaw's streams he pass'd: when lo! in camp.High-fenc'd, by nature's favour and by artStrong-cover'd, deep-entrench'd, proudly deem'dImpregnable, th' imperial Army lay,Much glorying in their strength, in numbers farSuperior. Still undaunted his bold marchFRED'RICK pursues: He nor their 'vantag'd ground,Nor high-fenc'd camp, nor trenches deep regards,Nor numbers far superior. On he leadsTo the fierce combat his courageous bands.They, by their Monarch's voice, (that fav'rite voice,)Enliven'd, joyous spring, with sweet presageOf victory; their standards wide unfurl'dIn awful pomp, with rich emblazonryOf vivid colours, streaming to the wind:And o'er the horrent plain of glitt'ring steelA wavy Harvest formidably gleam'd,Innumerable faulchions, the sun's blaze(Oft as his radiant beams from fleecy cloudEmerg'd) reflecting fierce with burnish'd sheen;
E'er long to be imbru'd in Austrian gore.E'er long to be imbru'd in Austrian gore.Nigh to the foe advanc'd, each Warrior brave,Commanders, and Commanded, with like zealInflam'd, and emulation high, contend,Who first shall the untrodden path explore,Who tempt the marish, who the threat'ning moundClime hazardous, plunge thro' the hostile fireForemost, and burst their serried files. Now 'ganThe onset dire, enkindled at th' alarmOf drums loud-thundring, and the trumpet's clangSonorous. Fierce the conflict rag'd 'twixt hostAnd host: The field throughout, was seen no glimpseOf dastard fear: each nobly signaliz'dTheir valorous ardor. Front to front they met,Warrior with warrior clos'd, and steed with steedIn stern encounter. The hoarse cannon's voiceEchoes with bellowing roar: redundant smokePours o'er the envelop'd sky, with horrid flashPierc'd frequent, and quick glance of sulph'rous flames.Swift thro' the ranks undaunted FRED'RICK sprung,High brandishing his faulchion, Austria's dread,From wing to distant wing unwearied flew,Now in the Van, now Rear: on ev'ry part,Thro' each vicissitude, each varying scene,With splendid conduct, animating sounds,And brave example, his obsequious bandsInspir'd, directed, instigated, cheer'd,And all his various pow'rs by turns display'd:Fervid, yet vigilant; with temper'd fireGuiding the rapid war's alternate reins.On every part his victor arm prevails.At length o'erpow'r'd, discomfited, recedeAustria's faint troops, abandoning the fieldDrench'd in their slaughter'd friends' commingled blood.How shall the Muse the wondrous havoc paint,The various images of horror traceO'er the wide champain? Now fierce-issuing ballsSwept mighty numbers: now th'impetuous sword
Clove with keen edge the tortur'd foe in twain.Thro' many a valiant breast with adverse strokePierc'd the sharp wound, and fix'd a glorious scar.Here from the quiv'ring trunk the sever'd headSwift flies: here the lop'd limb their lord desert,His agonizing groans, and fruitless plaintIn the rude clamour drown'd. With giant stridesDeath travers'd the dread plain, with all his pompOf terrors, and each ghastly form, enclos'd.What multitudes, great FRED'RICK, by thy arm,Thy just avenging arm, what crouds on croudsDescended to the baleful realms of night,E'erwhile with Austrian's throng'd! of adverse starsThere jointly they complain, their mutual woeSooth with condolence bland, and enterchangeSad gratulation: soon with gloomy joyHailing their mightiest Chieftain, new arriv'd,Thy great Antagonist; who gor'd with woundsOn the same fatal plain (heart-piercing wounds,That barr'd each glorious prospect of renown)At length groan'd forth indignant his high soul,In Prague's vain shelt'ring walls—Th' illustrious ShadeStalks on, nor deigns return th' unwelcome Hail.Pass we these dolorous regions, chearful LightRevisiting; with wonder to surveyThe living monuments of PRUSSIA's fame:The thousands foil'd, who yet this vital airBreathe, and in thraldom grace the Conqueror's train,Lo what unnumber'd Trophies, what rich SpoilsTorn from the grasping foe, the solemn pompAttend: their ravish'd Ensigns, wav'd sublime,With splended painture sloating thro' the air,Display puissant FREDERICK's ample fame.See how th' imperial Cannon, many a row,Move in slow pageantry; the brazen throatsSilenc'd, till FREDERICK bid them the dire roarRenew, and on their late Possessors proudPour the retorted rage.—Yet 'mid this Scene,
In all thy height of lustre, matchless Prince,To check thy triumph with th' ingenious tearDue to the mighty slain, on the dread plainsWhere grasp'd whole squadrons of th' expiring Foe,Fell valiant SCHWERIN, by each virtuous breastLov'd and lamented: gloriously he fell,With many a Chieftain of exalted nameAccompanied; who prodigal of life,Pour'd in their Country's cause their generous blood.Austria's deep consternation and dismay,(Of every aid, of her whole camp bereft)What tongue can utter? Or what pow'r describeFREDERICK's vast victory?—But other ScenesArise, of different hue. O hadst thou ne'erDeserted Prague's 'sieg'd wall, to charge the foeHigh-posted on th' aerial mountain's brow,With legions heap'd on legions, firm array'dBeneath th' imperial DAUN! Forgive the Muse,Great Chief, who with thy sundry glories charm'd,Yet void of adulation, while she strivesWith faintest pencil to delineateShadowy thy godlike virtues, paints thee man;The wisest of whose race, discreetest, best,'Mid all his shining faculties betraysSome tincture of th' impure alloy, deriv'dFrom his frail Ancestor.—Sagacious DAUNWith skill th' important situation chose;And look'd disdainful down. Tho' fierce defiles,Tho' thund'ring batteries intercept the way,Undaunted FREDERICK with his furious host,Thro' thund'ring batteries and thro' fierce defiles,Up the steep cliff his arduous road maintain'd.Thrice he assay'd the Austrian's pow'rful wingTo burst; repell'd them thrice; yet thrice return'd.Then calm receding with serene retreatSoft he descends to the subjacent vale,(Where Elbe her liquid course obliquely rollsMeand'ring) unretarded, unpursu'd.Soon Russia's legions (from her populous climeWith tardy steps advanc'd) their ling'ring marchAccelerate, and FREDERICK'S realms invade.Thus tho' insulted, the considerate ChiefWith terms of mild composure deigns inviteMoscow's imperial Queen his plan t' embrace,Surceasing hostile rage; and war's dire flamesExtinguishing, o'er harrass'd Europe pourThe salutary boon of prosp'rous Peace.His generous terms disdain'd, his pow'r defy'd,His territories spoil'd, war he declaresImmediate; trusting in his righteous Cause,And Heav'n's protecting Arm. LEWHALD led onThe squdrons, and encounter'd more than twiceHis force, entrench'd on tow'ring hill secure.Nathless he vigorous charg'd; their foremost linesBurst, and on every hand destruction dealtWide-wasting. Yet, lest the superior FoeCrush his brave host, by the unfriendly siteDisfavour'd, by enormous multitudesOppress'd, to Velau's camp the Chief matureRetreated, unrepulsed. The MoscovitesDismay'd, nor studious of pursuit, lamentTheir thousands slaughter'd and, theirGeneral Lapuchin. General thrall'd.Now in their several camps each Host enwraptRetire; and War's tremendous thunder restsSuspended: when at once, their sudden flightAssaying, Russia's troops with rapid speedScud as precipitant, as slow they advanc'dE'erwhile.—But lo! the fierce confed'rate Pow'rsVaunting united terrors, onward moveUnder their gallant Leaders, great SOUBISEAnd HILDBURGHAUSEN. Their proud threats t'opposeFREDERICK delay'd not: his assembled troopsHe rang'd in just array, and thus address'd:"My Friends, my Warriors brave!—The Foe's advanc'd;PRUSSIA shall meet them. Haste we to the field.With you your FREDERICK conquers or expires.
Think how we've fought! what glorious laurels won!Think on the equitable plea, that drewThese valiant swords, and vindicate the cause:God be our Guardian, Confidence and Shield.He ended; on he led his valiant filesDauntless, and bid them storm the the adverse wing:But on the edge of onset (his quick eyeDetermining) instant as lightning's glance,Invert they their position, lest the foeSurround them unnaware. Now Prussia's HorseSpring furious on the Gaul, in front directOppos'd, of vast immeasurable depth;The Gaul as furious, the brisk charge receiveWith equal brav'ry. Long in dubious scaleHung the fierce conflict: till the Gallic bandsSwerv'd; to the neighbouring summit's resuge flew,And recent form'd. FREDERICK their rallied forceSoon disarray'd, and with pursuit severeDrove, as the Lion drives his trembling chace.Then from each host the Cannon's bellowing voiceIncessant roar'd. Prussia's bold infantryRush forth, and battery after battery gain,With storms impetuous and unwearied fireRage their artillery, on either wingThe foe sore galling: till, constrain'd, they speedTheir ignominious flight, with soul defeatConfounded, and in ruin dire involv'd.And, but the Sun now prone descended swiftTo th' Ocean waves; and all-involving nightThrew her deep-shaded mantle o'er the plains,Fav'ring their trepid flight; of that vast host,Who spread at morning dawn their vaunted filesSo proud, how few had from the deathful fieldReturn'd, to tell the melancholy tale.Thou Miracle of Chiefs! and will our SonsBelieve, by storied Chronicles inform'dHow Brandenburgh's illustrious Prince, with forceImmensely disproportionate, subdu'd
Thousands on thousands of confederate Hosts!What numerous squadrons of the slaughter'd foeFell in their prime of Youth: Of Prussian bloodHow slight th' effusion: what redundant tidesOf captiv'd troops the Victor's camp o'erflow'd.The generous FREDERICK his triumphant joyAttempers sweet with piety humaneFor guiltless Widows and for Orphan babes,Thus multiplied by his victorious arm.Nobly compassionate to the fallen foe,With blandest treatment he beguiles their pain,Pours the soft balm in their fresh-bleeding wounds;And bids Captivity her dejected headRear, and unbend her brow with grateful smile.Now shall the humbled Gaul his vaunts suspend;And Moscow tremble at the Prussian name.Austria has felt, by oft repeated scourge,What martial discipline effects; what the wise Chief'sAssiduous Care: how fires each manly breastTo bold emprizes FREDERICK'S generous Soul,His fond Affection and paternal Love,In boundless streams impartially diffus'd.And thou, ambitious POLE, thy lawless prideRepress; nor with vain arrogance aspire,Grasping at alien realms: with wiser aimGuard well thy own, and to fair Truth adhere.Hark how the Sons of Albion's glorious IsleTune in harmonic choir the Conqueror's praise!Thee, FREDERICK, all her glist'ning cliffs resound,Thee her gay vallies, thee her mossy caves;And grove to grove repeats the pleasing songBritannia, resting on her ported spear,Majestic smiles; and with the pleasing songEnraptur'd, venerates the Prince, so brightResembling her lov'd Lord; to valorous GEORGEIn magnanimity, as in blood, allied.Still other wars, still other triumphs rise.The muse, unequal to the arduous task,
Breathless pursuing her unwearied ChiefFrom plain to tented plain, at length retires.O could she from the turmoils of the field,The clang of trumpets and the cannon's roar,Convey thee, FREDERICK, to thy dear Retreat,POTSDAM.Wrapt in the arms of Peace! In sweet reposeThere would the royal Bard thro' echoing shadesWith other notes than these, with loftier strainsTo his resounding lyre, hymn the great POW'R,Whom ever he adores with filial love,And reverential awe: Whose out-stretch'd armBows down th' obdurate fierceness of the proud,Th' un-ambitious rears; who with a breathWields all the thunder of the various war,OMNIPOTENT; and with his sovereign nodThe sate of mightiest Monarchies decides.FINIS.BOOKS just Published by W.
