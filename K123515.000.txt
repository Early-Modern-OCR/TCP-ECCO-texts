MDCCLXXVII.PREFACE,
To all that are concerned in the
EDUCATION of CHILDREN.My Friends,IT is an awful and important
Charge that is committed
to you. The Wisdom and
Welfare of the succeeding Generation
are intrusted with you beforehand, and
depend much on your Conduct. The
Seeds of Misery or Happiness in this
World, and that to come are oftentimes

sown very early; and therefore
whatever may conduce to give the
Minds of Children a Relish for Virtue
and Religion, ought, in the first
Place, to be proposed to you.VERSE was at first designed for the
Service of GOD, though it hath been
wretchedly abused since. The Ancients,
among the Jews and the Heathens,
taught their Children and Disciples the
Precepts of Morality and Worship in
Verse. The Children of Israel were
commanded to learn the Words of the
Song of Moses, Deut. xxxi. 19, 30. and
we are directed in the New Testament,
not only to sing with Grace in the Heart,
but to teach, and admonish one another
by Hymns and Songs, Ephes. v. 19. And
there are these four Advantages in it.
I. THERE is a great Delight in the
very learning of Truths and Duties this
Way. There is something so amusing
and entertaining in Rhymes and Metre,
that will incline Children to make this
Part of their Business a Diversion. And
you may turn their very Duty into a
Reward, by giving them the Privilege
of learning one of these SONGS every
Week, if they fulfil the Business of
the Week well, and promising them
the Book itself, when they have learnt
ten or twenty Songs out of it.II. WHAT is learnt in Verse, is
longer retained in Memory, and sooner
recollected. The like Sounds, and the
like Number of Syllables, exceedingly
assist the Remembrance. And it may
often happen, that the End of a Song
running in the Mind, may be an effectual
means to keep off some Temptations,

or to incline to some Duty, when
a Word of Scripture is not upon their
Thoughts.III. THIS will be a constant Furniture
for the Minds of Children, that
they may have something to think
upon when alone, and sing over to
themselves. This may sometimes give
their Thoughts a divine Turn, and
raise a young Meditation. Thus they
will not be forced to seek Relief for an
Emptiness of Mind, out of the loose
and dangerous Sonnets of the Age.IV. THESE Divine Songs may be a
pleasant and proper Matter for their
Daily or Weekly Worship, to sing one
in the Family, at such Time as the
Parents or Governors shall appoint;
and therefore I have confined the Verse
to the most usual Psalm Tunes.
THE greatest part of this little Book
was composed several Years ago, at the
Request of a Friend, who has been
long engaged in the Work of Catechising
a very great Number of Children
of all kinds, and with abundant
Skill and Success. So that you will
find here nothing that savours of a
Party: The Children of high and low
Degree, of the Church of England, or
Dissenters, baptised in Infancy, or not,
may all join together in these Songs.
And as I have endeavoured to sink the
Language to the Level of a Child's Understanding,
and yet to keep it, if possible,
above Contempt; so I have designed
to profit all, if possible, and offend
none. I hope the more general
the Sense is, these Composures may be
of the more universal Use and Service.
I HAVE added at the End, some
Attempts of SONNETS on MORAL
SUBJECTS, for Children, with an Air
of Pleasantry, to provoke some fitter
Pen to write a little Book of them.MAY the Almighty GOD make you
faithful in this important Work of Education;
may he succeed your Cares
with his abundant Grace, that the
rising Generation of Great Britain may
be a Glory among the Nations, a Pattern
to the Christian World, and a
Blessing to the Earth.CONTENTS.Song Page1. A General Song of Praise to GOD, 12. Praise for Creation and Providence, 23. Praise to GOD for our Redemption, 44. Praise for Mercies spiritual and

FOR
CHILDREN.SONG I.A general Song of Praise to GOD.I.HOW glorious is our heav'nly King,Who reigns above the Sky!How shall a Child presume to singHis dreadful Majesty?II.How great his Pow'r is, none can tell,Nor think how large his Grace;Not Men below, nor Saints that dwellOn high before his Face.III.Not Angels that stand round the LORD,Can search his secret Will;But they perform his heav'nly Word,And sing his Praises still.IV.Then let me join this holy Train,And my first Off'rings bring;Th' eternal GOD will not disdainTo hear an Infant sing.V.My Heart resolves, my Tongue obeys,And Angels shall rejoice,To hear their mighty Maker's PraiseSound from a feeble Voice.SONG II.Praise for Creation and Providence.I.I Sing th' Almighty Pow'r of GOD,That made the Mountains rise,That spread the flowing Seas abroad,And built the lofty Skies.II.I sing the Wisdom that ordain'dThe Sun to rule the Day;The Moon shines full at his Command,And all the Stars obey.III.I sing the Goodness of the LORD,That fill'd the Earth with Food;He form'd the Creatures with his Word,And then pronounc'd them Good.IV.LORD, how thy Wonders are display'd,Where'er I turn mine Eye!If I survey the Ground I tread,Or gaze upon the Sky!V.There's not a Plant or Flow'r below,But makes thy Glories known;And Clouds arise and Tempests blow,By Order from thy Throne.VI.Creatures (as num'rous as they be)▪Are subject to thy Care;There's not a Place where we can flee,But GOD is present there.VII.In Heav'n he shines with Beams of Love,With Wrath in Hell beneath!'Tis on his Earth I stand or move,And 'tis his Air I breathe.VIII.His Hand is my perpetual Guard;He keeps me with his Eye:Why should I then forget the LORD,Who is for ever nigh?SONG III.Praise to GOD for our Redemption.I.BLEST be the Wisdom and the Pow'r,The Justice and the Grace,That join'd in Counsel to restore,And save our ruin'd Race.II.Our Father ate forbidden Fruit,And from his Glory fell;And we his Children thus were broughtTo Death, and near to Hell.III.Blest be the LORD that sent his SonTo take our Flesh and Blood;He for our Lives gave up his own,To make our Peace with GOD.IV.He honour'd all his Father's Laws,Which we have disobey'd;He bore our Sins upon the Cross,And our full Ransom paid.V.Behold him rising from the Grave;Behold him rais'd on high:He pleads his Merit, there to saveTransgressors doom'd to die.VI.There on a glorious Throne he reigns,And by his Pow'r divineRedeems us from the slavish ChainsOf Satan and of Sin.VII.Thence shall the LORD to Judgment come,And with a sov'reign VoiceShall call, and break up ev'ry Tomb,While waking Saints rejoice.VIII.O may I then with Joy appearBefore the Judge's Face,And with the bless'd Assembly thereSing his Redeeming Grace.SONG IV.Praise for Mercies Spiritual and
Temporal.I.WHene'er I take my Walks abroad,How many Poor I see?What shall I render to my GODFor all his Gifts to me?II.Not more than others I deserve,Yet GOD his giv'n me more;For I have Food while others starve,Or beg from Door to Door.III.How many Children in the StreetHalf naked I behold?While I am cloth'd from Head to Feet,And cover'd from the Cold.IV.While some poor Wretches scarce can tellWhere they may lay their Head;I have a Home wherein to dwell,And rest upon my Bed.V.While others early learn to Swear,And Curse, and Lye, and Steal:LORD, I am taught thy Name to fear,And do thy holy Will.VI.Are these thy Favours Day by DayTo me above the Rest?Then let me love Thee more than theyAnd try to serve Thee best.SONG V.Praise for Birth and Education in a
Christian Land.I.GREAT GOD, to thee my Voice I raise,To thee my youngest Hours belong;I would begin my Life with Praise,Till growing Years improve the Song.II.'Tis to thy sov'reign Grace I oweThat I was born on British Ground;Where Streams of heav'nly Mercy flow,And Words of sweet Salvation sound.III.I would not change my native LandFor rich Peru with all her Gold:A nobler Prize lies in my Hand,Than East or Western Indies hold.IV.How do I pity those that dwellWhere Ignorance and Darkness reigns!They know no Heav'n▪ they fear no Hell,Those endless Joys, those endless Pains.V.Thy glorious Promises, O LORD,Kindle my Hopes and my Desire;While all the Preachers of thy WordWarn me to 'scape eternal Fire.VI.Thy Praise shall still employ my Breath,Since thou hast mark'd my Way to Heav'n;Nor will I run the Road to Death,And waste the Blessings thou hast giv'n.SONG VI.Praise for the Gospel.I.LORD, I ascribe it to thy Grace,And not to Chance as others do,That I was born of CHRISTIAN Race,And not a Heathen or a Jew.II.What would the ancient Jewish Kings,And Jewish Prophets once have giv'n,Could they have heard those glorious
Things,Which CHRIST reveal'd and brought from
Heav'n?III.How glad the Heathens would have been,That worship'd Idols, Wood and Stone,If they the Book of GOD had seen,Or JESUS and his Gospel known!IV.Then if this Gospel I refuse,How shall I e'er lift up mine Eyes?For all the Gentiles and the Jews,Against me will in Judgment rise.SONG VII.The Excellency of the BIBLE.I.GREAT GOD, with Wonder and with PraiseOn all thy Works I look;But still thy Wisdom, Pow'r and Grace,Shine brightest in thy Book.II.The Stars that in their Courses roll,Have much Instruction giv'n;But thy good Word informs my SoulHow I may climb to Heav'n.III.The Fields provide me Food, and showThe Goodness of the LORD;But Fruits of Life and Glory growIn thy most holy Word.IV.Here are my choicest Treasures hid,Here my best Comfort lies;Here my Desires are satisfy'd,And hence my Hopes arise.V.LORD, make me understand thy Law;Shew what my Faults have been;And from thy Gospel let me drawPardon for all my Sin.VI.Here would I learn how CHRIST has dy'dTo save my Soul from Hell:Not all the Books on Earth besideSuch heav'nly Wonders tell.VII.Then let me love my Bible more,And take a fresh DelightBy Day to read these Wonders o'er,And meditate by Night.SONG VIII.Praise to GOD for learning to Read.I.THE Praises of my TongueI offer to the LORD,That I was taught, and learnt so youngTo read his holy Word.II.That I am brought to knowThe Danger I was in,By Nature and by Practice too,A wretched Slave to Sin.III.That I am lead to seeI can do nothing well;And whither shall a Sinner fleeTo save himself from Hell?IV.Dear LORD. this Book of thineInforms me where to go,For Grace to pardon all my Sin,And make me holy too.V.Here I can read, and learnHow CHRIST, the Son of GOD,Has undertook our great Concern;Our Ransom cost his Blood.VI.And now he reigns above,He sends his Spirit downTo shew the Wonders of his Love,And make his Gospel known.VII.O may that Spirit teach,And make my Heart receiveThose Truths which all thy Servants preachAnd all thy Saints believe.VIII.Then shall I praise the LORDIn a more chearful Strain,That I was taught to read his Word,And have not learnt in vain.SONG IX.The All-seeing GOD.I.ALMIGHTY GOD, thy piercing EyeStrikes thro' the Shades of Night,And our most secret Actions lieAll open to thy Sight.II.There's not a Sin that we commit,Nor wicked Word we say,But in thy dreadful Book 'tis writ,Against the Judgment-Day.III.And must the Crimes that I have doneBe read and publish'd there?Be all expos'd before the Sun,While Men and Angels hear?IV.LORD, at thy Foot asham'd I lie;Upward I dare not look;Pardon my Sins before I die,And blot them from thy Book.V.Remember all the dying PainsThat my Redeemer felt,And let his Blood wash out my Stains,And answer for my Guilt.VI.O may I now for ever fearT' indulge a sinful Thought,Since the great GOD can see and hear,And writes down ev'ry Fault.SONG X.Solemn Thoughts of GOD and Death.I.THere is a GOD that reigns above,LORD of the Heav'ns and Earth and
Seas:I fear his Wrath, I ask his Love,And with my Lips I sing his Praise,II.There is a Law which he has writ,To teach us all that we must do:My Soul, to his Commands submit,For they are holy, just and true.III.There is a Gospel of rich Grace,Whence Sinners all their Comforts draw:LORD, I repent, and seek thy Face;For I have often broke thy Law.IV.There is an Hour when I must die,Nor do I know how soon 'twill come;A thousand Children young as I,Are call'd by Death to hear their Doom.V.Let me improve the Hours I have,Before the Day of Grace is fled;There's no Repentance in the Grave,Nor Pardons offer'd to the Dead.VI.Just as the Tree cut down, that fellTo North or Southward, there it lies;So Man departs to Heav'n or Hell,Fix'd in the State wherein he dies.SONG XI.Heaven and Hell.I.THERE is beyond the SkyA Heav'n of Joy and Love;And holy Children when they dieGo to that World above.II.There is a dreadful Hell,And everlasting Pains;There Sinners must with Devils dwellIn Darkness, Fire and Chains.III.Can such a Wretch as IEscape this cursed End?And may I hope whene'er I dieI shall to Heav'n ascend?IV.Then will I read and pray,While I have Life and Breath;Lest I should be cut off to-day,And sent t' eternal Death.SONG XII.The Advantages of early Religion.I.HAPPY the Child whose tender YearsReceive Instructions well:Who hates the Sinner's Path, and fearsThe Road that leads to Hell.II.When we devote our Youth to GOD,'Tis pleasing in his Eyes;A Flow'r, when offer'd in the Bud,Is no vain Sacrifice.III.'Tis easier Work if we beginTo fear the LORD betimes;While Sinners that grow old in SinAre harden'd in their Crimes,IV.'Twill save us from a thousand Snares,To mind Religion young;Grace will preserve our following Years,And make our Virtue strong.V.To thee, Almighty GOD, to thee,Our Childhood we resign;'Twill please us to look back and seeThat our whole Lives were thine.VI.Let the sweet Work of Pray'r and PraiseEmploy my youngest Breath;Thus I'm prepar'd for longer Days,Or fit for early Death.SONG XIII.The Danger of Delay.I.WHY should I say, "'Tis yet too soon"To seek for Heaven, or think of Death?"A Flow'r may fade before 'tis Noon,And I this Day may lose my Breath.II.If this rebellious Heart of mineDespise the gracious Calls of Heav'n,I may be harden'd in my Sin,And never have Repentance giv'n.III.What if the LORD grow wrath and swear,While I refuse to read and pray,That he'll refuse to lend an EarTo all my Grones another Day?IV.What if his dreadful Anger burn,While I refuse his offer'd Grace,And all his Love to Fury turn,And strike me dead upon the Place?V.'Tis dang'rous to provoke a GOD!His Pow'r and Veng'ance none can tell;One Stroke of his Almighty RodShall send young Sinners quick to Hell.VI.Then 'twill for ever be in vain▪To cry for Pardon and for Grace:To wish I had my Time again,Or hope to see my Maker's Face.SONG XIV.Examples of early Piety.I.WHAT bless'd Examples do I find:Writ in the Word of Truth,Of Children that began to mind.Religion in their Youth?II.JESUS, who reigns above the Sky,And keeps the World in Awe,Was once a Child as young as I,And kept his Father's Law.III.At Twelve Years old he talk'd with Men,(The Jews all wond'ring stand)Yet he obey'd his Mother then,And came at her Command.IV.Children a sweet Hosanna sung,And blest their Saviour's Name;They gave him Honour with their Tongue,While Scribes and Priests blaspheme.V.SAMUEL the Child was wean'd and broughtTo wait upon the LORD;Young TIMOTHY betimes was taughtTo know his holy Word.VI.Then why should I so long delayWhat others learnt so soon?I would not pass another DayWithout this Work begun.SONG XV.Against Lying.I.O 'Tis a lovely Thing for YouthTo walk betimes in Wisdom's Way;To fear a Lie, to speak the Truth,That we may trust to all they say.II.But Liars we can never trust,Tho' they should speak the Thing that's true;And he that does one Fault at first,And lies to hide it, makes it two.III.Have we not known, nor heard, nor read,How GOD abhors Deceit and Wrong?How Ananias was struck dead,Catch'd with a Lie upon his Tongue?IV.So did his Wife Sapphira die,When she came in, and grew so boldAs to confirm that wicked LieThat just before her Husband told.V.The LORD delights in them that speakThe Words of Truth; but ev'ry LiarMust have his Portion in the LakeThat burns with Brimstone and with Fire.VI.Then let me always watch my Lips,Lest I be struck to Death and Hell,Since GOD a Book of Reck'ning keepsFor ev'ry Lie that Children tell.SONG XVI.Against Quarrelling and Fighting.I.LET Dogs delight to bark and bite;For GOD hath made them so;Let Bears and Lions growl and fight,For 'tis their Nature too.II.But, Children, you should never letSuch angry Passions rise;Your little Hands were never madeTo tear each others Eyes.III.Let Love thro' all your Actions run,And all your Words be mild;Live like the blessed Virgin's Son,That sweet and lovely Child.IV.His Soul was gentle as a Lamb;And as his Stature grew,He grew in Favour both with Man,And GOD his Father too.V.Now LORD of All he reigns Above,And from his heav'nly ThroneHe sees what Children dwell in Love,And marks them for his own.SONG XVII.Love between Brothers and Sisters.I.WHatever Brawls disturb the Street,There should be Peace at Home;Where Sisters dwell and Brothers meet,Quarrels should never come.II.Birds in their little Nests agree;And 'tis a shameful Sight,When Children of one FamilyFall out, and chide and fight.III.Hard Names at first, and threat'ning Words,That are but noisy Breath,May grow to Clubs and naked Swords;To Murder and to Death.IV.The Devil tempts one Mother's SonTo rage against another,So wicked Cain was hurry'd onTill he had kill'd his Brother.V.The Wife will make their Anger cool,At least before 'tis Night;But in the Bosom of a FoolIt burns till Morning-light.VI.Pardon, O LORD, our childish Rage,Our little Brawls remove;That as we grow to riper Age,Our Hearts may all be Love.SONG XVIII.Against Scoffing and calling Names.I.OUR Tongues were made to bless the LORD,And not speak ill of Men;When others give a railing Word,We must not rail again.II.Cross Words and angry Names requireTo be chastis'd at School;And He's in Danger of Hell-fireThat calls his Brother Fool.III.But Lips that dare be so profane,To mock and jeer and scoffAt holy Things or holy Men,The LORD shall cut them off.IV.When Children in heir wanton PlayServ'd old ELISHA so;And bid the Prophet go his Way,"Go up, thou Bald-Head, go."V.GOD quickly stopp'd their wicked Breath,And sent two raging Bears,That tore them Limb from Limb to Death,With Blood and Groans and Tears.VI.Great GOD, how terrible are ThouTo Sinners e'er so young!Grant me thy Grace, and teach me howTo tame and rule my Tongue.SONG XIX.Against Swearing, and Cursing, and
taking God's Name in vain.I.ANGELS, that high in Glory dwell,Adore thy Name, Almighty GOD!And Devils tremble down in Hell,Beneath the Terrors of thy Rod.II.And yet how wicked Children dareAbuse thy dreadful glorious Name!And when they're angry how they swear,And curse their Fellows, and blaspheme!III.How will they stand before thy Face,Who treated thee with such Disdain,While thou shalt doom them to the PlaceOf everlasting Fire and Pain?IV.Then never shall one cooling DropTo quench their burning Tongues be
giv'n;But I will praise thee here and hopeThus to employ my Tongue in Heav'n.V.My Heart shall be in pain to hearWretches affront the LORD above;'Tis that great GOD whose Pow'r I fear;That heav'nly Father whom I love.VI.If my Companions grow profane,I'll leave their Friendship, when I hearYoung Sinners take thy Name in vain,And learn to curse and learn to swear.SONG XX.Against Idleness and Mischief.I.HOW doth the little busy BeeImprove each shining Hour,And gather Honey all the DayFrom ev'ry op'ning Flow'r?II.How skilfully she builds her Cell!How neat she spreads the Wax!And labours hard to store it wellWith the sweet Food she makes.III.In Works of Labour or of Skill,I would be busy too;For Satan finds some Mischief stillFor idle Hands to do.IV.In Books, or Work, or healthful Play,Let my first Years be past,That I may give for ev'ry DaySome good Account at last.SONG XXI.Against Evil Company.I.WHY should I join with those in Play,In whom I've no Delight;Who curse and swear, but never pray;Who call ill Names and fight?II.I hate to hear a wanton Song;Their Words offend mine Ears;I should not dare defile my TongueWith Language such as theirs.III.Away from Fools I'll turn mine Eyes;Nor with the Scoffers go;I would be walking with the Wise,That wiser I may grow.IV.From one rude Boy that's us'd to mock,They learn the wicked Jest:One sickly Sheep infects the Flock,And poisons all the rest.V.My God, I hate to walk, or dwellWith sinful Children here;Then let me not be sent to Hell,Where none but Sinners are.SONG XXII.Against Pride in Clothes.I.WHY should our Garments, made to hideOur Parents Shame, provoke our
Pride?The Art of Dress did ne'er begin,Till EVE our Mother learnt to sin.II.When first she put the Cov'ring on,Her Robe of Innocence was gone;And yet her Children vainly boastIn the sad Marks of Glory lost.III.How proud we are! how fond to shewOur Clothes, and call them rich and new!When the poor Sheep and Silk-worm woreThat very Clothing long before.IV.The Tulip and the ButterflyAppear in gayer Coats than I:Let me be drest fine as I will,Flies, Worms and Flow'rs exceed me still.V.Then will I set my Heart to findInward Adornings of the Mind;Knowledge and Virtue, Truth and Grace,These are the Robes of richest Dress.VI.No more shall Worms with me compare;This is the Raiment Angels wear;The Son of GOD, when here below,Put on this blest Apparel too.VII.It never fades, it ne'er grows old,Nor fears the Rain nor Moth nor Mold:It takes no Spot but still refines;The more 'tis worn, the more it shines.VIII.In this on Earth should I appear,Then go to Heav'n and wear it there;GOD will approve it in his Sight;'Tis his own Work, and his Delight.SONG XXIII.Obedience to Parents.I.LET Children that would fear the LORDHear what their Teachers say;With Rev'rence meet their Parents Word,And with Delight obey.II.Have you not heard what dreadful PlaguesAre threaten'd by the LORD,To him that breaks his Father's Law,Or mocks his Mother's Word?III.What heavy Guilt upon him lies!How cursed is his Name!The Ravens shall pick out his Eyes,And Eagles eat the same.IV.But those who worship GOD and giveTheir Parents Honour due,Here on this Earth they long shall live,And live hereafter too.SONG XXIV.The Child's Complaint.I.WHY should I love my Sports so well,So constant at my Play,And lose the Thoughts of Heav'n and Hell;And then forget to pray?II.What do I read my Bible for,But, LORD, to learn thy Will;And shall I daily know thee more,And less obey thee still?III.How senseless is my Heart and wild!How vain are all my Thoughts?Pity the Weakness of a Child,And pardon all my Faults.IV.Make me thy heav'nly Voice to hear,And let me love to pray;Since GOD will lend a gracious EarTo what a Child can say.SONG XXV.A MORNING SONG:I.MY GOD, who makes the Sun to knowHis proper Hour to rise,And to give Light to all below,Doth send him round the Skies.II.When from the Chambers of the EastHis Morning Race begins,He never tires, nor stops to rest;But round the World he shines.III.So, like the Sun, would I fulfilThe Business of the Day:Begin my Work betimes, and stillMarch on my heav'nly Way.IV.Give me, O LORD, thy early Grace,Nor let my Soul ComplainThat the young Morning of my DaysHas all been spent in vain.SONG XXVI.An EVENING SONG.I.AND now another Day is gone,I'll sing my Maker's Praise;My Comforts ev'ry Hour make knownHis Providence and Grace.II.But how my Childhood runs to waste!My Sins, how great their Sum!LORD, give me Pardon for the past;And Strength for Days to come.III.I lay my Body down to Sleep;Let Angels guard my Head,And thro' the Hours of Darkness keepTheir Watch around my Bed.IV.With cheerful Heart I close my Eyes,Since thou wilt not remove;And in the Morning let me riseRejoicing in thy Love.SONG XXVII.For the LORD's-DAY MORNING.I.THis is the Day when CHRIST aroseSo early from the Dead;Why should I keep my Eyelids clos'd,And waste my Hours in Bed?II.This is the Day when JESUS brokeThe Pow'r of Death and Hell;And shall I still wear Satan's Yoke,And love my Sins so well?III.To-Day with Pleasure Christians meet,To pray and hear the Word:And I would go with cheerful FeetTo learn thy Will, O LORD.IV.I'll leave my Sport to read and pray,And so prepare for Heav'n:O may I love this blessed DayThe best of all the Sev'n!SONG XXVIII.For the LORD'S-DAY EVENING.I.LORD, how delightful 'tis to seeA whole Assembly worship Thee!At once they sing, at once they pray;They hear of Heav'n, and learn the Way.II.I have been there, and still would go:'Tis like a little Heav'n below:Not all my Pleasure and my PlayShall tempt me to forget this Day.III.O write upon my Mem'ry, LORD,The Text and Doctrines of thy Word;That I may break thy Laws no more,But love thee better than before.IV.With Thoughts of Christ and Things divineFill up this foolish Heart of mine;That hoping Pardon thro' his Blood,I may lie down and wake with GOD.The TEN COMMANDMENTS, out of the Old
Testament, put into short Rhyme for Children.EXODUS, CHAP. XX.1. THOU shalt have no more Gods but me.2. Before no Idol bow thy Knee.3. Take not the Name of GOD in vain.4. Nor dare the Sabbath-day profane.5. Give both thy Parents Honour due.6. Take heed that thou no Murder do.7. Abstain from Words and Deeds unclean.8. Nor steal, tho' thou art poor and mean.9. Nor make a wilful Lie, nor love it.10. What is thy Neighbour's dare not covet.The Sum of the COMMANDMENTS, out of
the New Testament.MATT. xxii. 37.WITH all thy Soul love GOD above,And as thyself thy Neighbour loveOur Saviour's Golden Rule.MATT. vii. 12.BE you to others kind and true,As you'd have others be to you;And neither do nor say to Men,Whate'er you would not take again.Duty to God and our Neighbour.LOVE GOD with all your Soul and Strength,With all your Heart and Mind:And love your Neighbour as yourself.Be faithful, just and kind.Deal with another, as you'd haveAnother deal with you;What you're unwilling to receive,Be sure you never do.Out of my Book of HYMNS I have here
added the HOSANNA, and GLORY to
the Father, &c. to be sung at the End

OF
MORAL SONGS,
Such as I wish some happy and condescending
Genius would undertake for the Use of
Children, and perform much better.THE Sense and Subjects might be borrowed
plentifully from the Proverbs
of Solomon, from all the common Appearances
of Nature, from all the Occurrences
in Civil Life, both in City and Country:
(Which would also afford Matter for
other divine Songs.) Here the Language
and Measures should be easy and flowing
with Cheerfulness, with or without the Solemnities
of Religion, or the sacred Names
of GOD and Holy Things; that Children
might find Delight and Profit together.This would be one effectual Way to deliver
them from the Temptation of loving
or learning those idle, wanton, or profane
Songs, which give so early an ill Taint to
the Fancy and Memory; and become the
Seeds of future Vices.I. The SLUGGARD.I.'TIS the Voice of the Sluggard; I heard
him complain."You have wak'd me too soon, I must
slumber again;"As the Door on its Hinges, so he on his Bed,Turns his Sides and his Shoulders and his
heavy Head.II."A little more Sleep, and a little more
Slumber;"Thus he wastes half his Days, and his
Hours without Number;And when he gets up he sits folding his
Hands,Or walks about saunt'ring, or trifling he
stands.III.I pass'd by his Garden, and saw the wild
Brier,The Thorn and the Thistle grow broader
and higher;The Cloaths that hang on him are turning
to Rags:And his Money still wastes, till he starves
or he begs.IV.I made him a Visit still hoping to findHe had took better Care for improving his
Mind:He told me his Dreams, talk'd of Eating
and Drinking;But he scarce reads his Bible, and never
loves Thinking.V.Said I then to my Heart, "Here's a Lesson for me:"That Man's but a Picture of what I might
be:But Thanks to my Friends for their Care
in my Breeding,Who taught me betimes to love Working
and Reading.II. Innocent Play.I.A Broad in the Meadows to see the young
LambsRun sporting about by the Side of their Dams,With Fleeces so clean and so white;Or a Nest of young Doves in a large
open Cage,When they play all in Love, without Anger
or Rage,How much may we learn from the Sight?II.If we had been Ducks, we might dabble
in Mud;Or Dogs, we might play till it ended in
Blood;So foul and so fierce are their Natures:But Thomas and William, and such pretty
Names,Should be cleanly and harmless as Doves,
or as Lambs,Those lovely sweet innocent Creatures.III.Not a Thing that we do, nor a Word that
we say,Should hinder another in Jesting or Play;For he's still in earnest that's hurt:How rude are the Boys that throw Pebbles
and Mire!There's none but a Madman will fling
about Fire,And tell you, "'Tis all but in Sport."III. The ROSE.I.HOW fair is the Rose? what a beautiful
Flow'r?The Glory of April and May:But the Leaves are beginning to fade in
an Hour,And they wither and die in a Day.II.Yet the Rose has one powerful Virtue to
boast,Above all the Flowers of the Field:When its Leaves are all dead, and fine
Colours are lost,Still how sweet a Perfume it will yield?III.So frail is the Youth and the Beauty of
Men,Tho' they bloom and look gay like the
Rose:But all our fond Care to preserve them is
vain;Time kills them as fast as he goes.IV.Then I'll not be proud of my Youth or
my Beauty,Since both of them wither and fade:But gain a good Name by well-doing my
Duty;This will scent like a Rose when I'm dead.IV. The THIEF.I.WHY should I deprive my NeighbourOf his Goods against his Will?Hands were made for honest Labour,Not to plunder or to steal.II.'Tis a foolish Self-deceivingBy such Tricks to hope for Gain:All that's ever got by ThievingTurns to Sorrow, Shame, and Pain.III.Have not Eve and Adam taught usTheir sad Profit to compute?To what dismal State they brought usWhen they stole forbidden Fruit?IV.Oft we see a young BeginnerPractise little pilf'ring Ways,Till grown up a harden'd Sinner;Then the Gallows ends his Days.V.Theft will not be always hidden,Tho' we fancy none can spy:When we take a Thing forbidden,GOD beholds it with his Eye.VI.Guard my Heart, O GOD of Heav'n,Lest I covet what's not mine:Lest I steal what is not giv'n,Guard my Heart and Hands from Sin.V. The ANT or EMMET.I.THESE Emmets how little they are in
our Eyes?We tread them to Dust, and a Troop of
them diesWithout our Regard or Concern:Yet, as wise as we are, if we went to
their School,There's many a Sluggard, and many a Fool,Some Lessons of Wisdom might learn.II.They don't wear their Time out in Sleeping
or Play,But gather up Corn in a sun-shiny Day,And for Winter they lay up their Stores:They manage their Work in such regular
Forms,One would think they foresaw all the Frosts
and the Storms,And so brought their Food within Doors.III.But I have less Sense than a poor creeping
Ant,If I take not due Care for the Things I
shall want,Nor provide against Dangers in Time.When Death or old Age shall stare in my
Face,What a Wretch shall I be in the End of
my Days,If I trifle away all their Prime?IV.Now, now, while my Strength and myYouth are in Bloom,Let me think what will serve me whenSickness shall come,And pray that my Sins be forgiv'n:Let me read in good Books, and believe,
and obey,That when Death turns me out of thisCottage of Clay,I may dwell in a Palace in Heav'n.VI. Good Resolutions.I.THO' I am now in younger Days,Nor can tell what shall befall me,I'll prepare for ev'ry PlaceWhere my growing Age shall call me.II.Should I e'er be Rich or Great,Others shall partake my Goodness;I'll supply the Poor with Meat,Never shewing Scorn or Rudeness.III.Where I see the Blind or Lame,Deaf or Dumb, I'll kindly treat them;I deserve to feel the sameIf I mock, or hurt, or cheat them.IV.If I meet with railing Tongues,Why should I return them Railing,Since I best revenge my WrongsBy my Patience never failing?V.When I hear them telling Lies,Talking foolish, Cursing, Swearing;First I'll try to make them wise,Or I'll soon go out of hearing.VI.What tho' I be low and mean,I'll engage the Rich to love me,While I'm modest, neat and clean,And submit when they reprove me.VII.If I should be poor and sick,I shall meet, I hope, with Pity,Since I love to help the Weak,Tho' they're neither fair nor witty.VIII.I'll not willingly offend,Nor be easily offended;What's amiss I'll strive to mend,And endure what can't be mended.IX.May I be so watchful stillO'er my Humours and my Passion,As to speak and do no Ill,Tho' it should be all the Fashion.X.Wicked Fashions lead to Hell;Ne'er may I be found complying;But in Life behave so well,Not to be afraid of dying.A SUMMER EVENING.I.HOW fine has the Day been, how
bright was the Sun,How lovely and joyful the Course that he run,Tho' he rose in a Mist when his Race he
begun,And there follow'd some Droppings of
Rain!But now the fair Traveller's come to the West,His Rays are all Gold, and his Beauties
are best;He paints the Sky gay as he sinks to his
Rest,And foretels a bright Rising again.II.Just such is the Christian: His Course he
begins,Like the Sun in a Mist, while he mourns
for his Sins,And melts into Tears: Then he breaks
out and shines,And travels his heav'nly Way:But when he comes nearer to finish his Race,Like a fine setting Sun he looks richer in
Grace,And gives a sure Hope at the End of his DaysOf rising in brighter Array.Some Copies of the following HYMN having
got abroad already into several Hands,
the Author has been persuaded to permit
it to appear in Public, at the End of
these SONGS for CHILDREN.A CRADLE HYMN.I.HUSH! my dear, lie still and slumber,Holy Angels guard thy Bed!Heav'nly Blessings without NumberGently falling on thy Head.II.Sleep, my Babe; thy Food and Raiment,House and Home thy Friends provide;All without thy Care or Payment,All thy Wants are well supply'd.III.How much better thou'rt attendedThan the SON of GOD could be;When from Heav'n he descended,And became a Child like thee?IV.Soft and easy is thy Cradle:Coarse and hard thy Saviour lay;When his Birth-place was a Stable,And his softest Bed was Hay.V.Blessed Babe! what glorious Features,Spotless fair, divinely bright!Must he dwell with brutal Creatures!How could Angels bear the Sight?VI.Was there nothing but a MangerCursed Sinners could afford,To receive the heavenly Stranger!Did they thus affront their LORD?VII.Soft my Child? I did not chide thee,Tho' my Song might sound too hard;'Tis thy
Mother / NurseHere you may use the Words, Brother, Sister, Neighbour, Friend, &c. that
sits beside thee,And her Arms shall be thy Guard.VIII.Yet to read the shameful Story,How the Jews abus'd their King,How they serv'd the LORD of Glory,Makes me angry while I sing.IX.See the kinder Shepherds round him,Telling Wonders from the Sky!Where they sought him, there they found him,With his Virgin Mother by.X.See the lovely Babe a-dressing;Lovely Infant, how he smil'd!When he wept, the Mother's BlessingSooth'd and hush'd the holy Child.XI.Lo, he slumbers in his Manger,Where the horned Oxen fed;Peace, my Darling, here's no Danger,Here's no Ox a-near thy Bed.XII.'Twas to save Thee, Child, from dying,Save my Dear from burning Flame,Bitter Grones and endless Crying,That thy blest Redeemer came.XIII.May'st thou live to know and fear Him,Trust and love him all thy Days;Then go dwell for ever near Him,See his Face, and sing his Praise?XIV.I could give thee thousand Kisses,Hoping what I most desire;Not a Mother's fondest WishesCan to greater Joys aspire.THE END.BOOKS published by the AUTHOR for the Use of CHILDREN.I.
