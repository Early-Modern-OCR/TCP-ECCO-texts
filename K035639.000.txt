1793.TO
WILLIAM COWPER, ESQ.DEAR SIR,THERE is, I hope, some propriety in my addressing a Composition
to you, which would never perhaps have existed, had
I not, amid the heavy pressure of many sorrows, derived
infinite consolation from your Poetry, and some degree of
animation and of confidence from your esteem.The following performance is far from aspiring to be considered
as an imitation of your inimitable Poem, "THE
TASK;" I am perfectly sensible, that it belongs not to a
feeble and feminine hand to draw the Bow of Ulysses.The force, clearness, and sublimity of your admirable Poem;
the felicity, almost peculiar to your genius, of giving to the
most familiar objects dignity and effect, I could never hope to

reach; yet, having read "The Task" almost incessantly from
its first publication to the present time, I felt that kind of
enchantment described by Milton, when he says,
The Angel ended, and in Adam's earSo charming left his voice, that he awhileThought him still speaking.—And from the force of this impression, I was gradually led to
attempt, in Blank Verse, a delineation of those interesting objects
which happened to excite my attention, and which even
pressed upon an heart, that has learned, perhaps from its own
sufferings, to feel with acute, though unavailing compassion,
the calamity of others.A Dedication usually consists of praises and of apologies;
my praise can add nothing to the unanimous and loud applause
of your country. She regards you with pride, as one of the
few, who, at the present period, rescue her from the imputation
of having degenerated in Poetical talents; but in the
form of Apology, I should have much to say, if I again dared
to plead the pressure of evils, aggravated by their long continuance,
as an excuse for the defects of this attempt.
Whatever may be the faults of its execution, let me vindicate
myself from those, that may be imputed to the design.—
In speaking of the Emigrant Clergy, I beg to be understood as
feeling the utmost respect for the integrity of their principles;
and it is with pleasure I add my suffrage to that of those,
who have had a similar opportunity of witnessing the conduct
of the Emigrants of all descriptions during their exile in England;
which has been such as does honour to their nation,
and ought to secure to them in ours the esteem of every liberal
mind.Your philanthropy, dear Sir, will induce you, I am persuaded,
to join with me in hoping, that this painful exile may
finally lead to the extirpation of that reciprocal hatred so
unworthy of great and enlightened nations; that it may tend
to humanize both countries, by convincing each, that good
qualities exist in the other; and at length annihilate the prejudices
that have so long existed to the injury of both.Yet it is unfortunately but too true, that with the body of
the English, this national aversion has acquired new force by
the dreadful scenes which have been acted in France during

the last summer—even those who are the victims of the
Revolution, have not escaped the odium, which the undistinguishing
multitude annex to all the natives of a country where
such horrors have been acted: nor is this the worst effect those
events have had on the minds of the English; by confounding
the original cause with the wretched catastrophes that have
followed its ill management; the attempts of public virtue,
with the outrages that guilt and folly have committed in its
disguise, the very name of Liberty has not only lost the charm
it used to have in British ears, but many, who have written,
or spoken, in its defence, have been stigmatized as promoters
of Anarchy, and enemies to the prosperity of their country.
Perhaps even the Author of "The Task," with all his goodness
and tenderness of heart, is in the catalogue of those,
who are reckoned to have been too warm in a cause, which
it was once the glory of Englishmen to avow and defend—
The exquisite Poem, indeed, in which you have honoured
Liberty, by a tribute highly gratifying to her sincerest
friends, was published some years before the demolition of
regal despotisin in France, which, in the fifth book, it seems

to foretell—All the truth and energy of the passage to which
I allude, must have been strongly felt, when, in the Parliament
of England, the greatest Orator of our time quoted the
sublimest of our Poets—when the eloquence of Fox did justice
to the genius of Cowper.I am, dear SIR,
With the most perfect esteem,
Your obliged and obedient servant,

EMIGRANTS.BOOK THE FIRST.BOOK I.SCENE, on the Cliffs to the Eastward of the Town of
Brighthelmstone in Sussex.TIME, a Morning in November, 1792.SLOW in the Wintry Morn, the struggling lightThrows a faint gleam upon the troubled waves;Their foaming tops, as they approach the shoreAnd the broad surf that never ceasing breaksOn the innumerous pebbles, catch the beamsOf the pale Sun, that with reluctance givesTo this cold northern Isle, its shorten'd day.Alas! how few the morning wakes to joy!How many murmur at oblivious nightFor leaving them so soon; for bearing thus
Their fancied bliss (the only bliss they taste!),On her black wings away!—Changing the dreamsThat sooth'd their sorrows, for calamities(And every day brings its own sad proportion)For doubts, diseases, abject dread of Death,And faithless friends, and fame and fortune lost;Fancied or real wants; and wounded pride,That views the day star, but to curse his beams.Yet He, whose Spirit into being call'dThis wond'rous World of Waters; He who bidsThe wild wind lift them till they dash the clouds,And speaks to them in thunder; or whose breath,Low murmuring o'er the gently heaving tides,When the fair Moon, in summer night serene,Irradiates with long trembling lines of lightTheir undulating surface; that great Power,
Who, governing the Planets, also knowsIf but a Sea-Mew falls, whose nest is hidIn these incumbent cliffs; He surely meansTo us, his reasoning Creatures, whom He bidsAcknowledge and revere his awful hand,Nothing but good: Yet Man, misguided Man,Mars the fair work that he was bid enjoy,And makes himself the evil he deplores.How often, when my weary soul recoilsFrom proud oppression, and from legal crimes(For such are in this Land, where the vain boastOf equal Law is mockery, while the costOf seeking for redress is sure to plungeTh' already injur'd to more certain ruinAnd the wretch starves, before his Counsel pleads)How often do I half abjure Society,
And sigh for some lone Cottage, deep embower'dIn the green woods, that these steep chalky HillsGuard from the strong South West; where round their baseThe Beach wide flourishes, and the light AshWith slender leaf half hides the thymy turf!—There do I wish to hide me; well contentIf on the short grass, strewn with fairy flowers,I might repose thus shelter'd; or when EveIn Orient crimson lingers in the west,Gain the high mound, and mark these waves remote(Lucid tho' distant), blushing with the raysOf the far-flaming Orb, that sinks beneath them;For I have thought, that I should then beholdThe beauteous works of God, unspoil'd by ManAnd less affected then, by human woesI witness'd not; might better learn to bear
Those that injustice, and duplicityAnd faithlessness and folly, fix on me:For never yet could I derive relief,When my swol'n heart was bursting with its sorrows,From the sad thought, that others like myselfLive but to swell affliction's countless tribes!—Tranquil seclusion I have vainly sought;Peace, who delights in solitary shade,No more will spread for me her downy wings,But, like the fabled Danaids—or the wretch,Who ceaseless, up the steep acclivity,Was doom'd to heave the still rebounding rock,Onward I labour; as the baffled wave,Which you rough beach repulses, that returnsWith the next breath of wind, to fail again.—Ah! Mourner—cease these wailings: cease and learn,
That not the Cot sequester'd, where the briarAnd wood-bine wild, embrace the mossy thatch,(Scarce seen amid the forest gloom obscure!)Or more substantial farm, well fenced and warm,Where the full barn, and cattle fodder'd roundSpeak rustic plenty; nor the statelier domeBy dark firs shaded, or the aspiring pine,Close by the village Church (with care conceal'dBy verdant foliage, lest the poor man's graveShould mar the smiling prospect of his Lord),Where offices well rang'd, or dove-cote stock'd,Declare manorial residence; not theseOr any of the buildings, new and trimWith windows circling towards the restless Sea,Which ranged in rows, now terminate my walk,Can shut out for an hour the spectre Care,
That from the dawn of reason, follows stillUnhappy Mortals, 'till the friendly grave(Our sole secure asylum) "ends the chace1."Behold, in witness of this mournful truth,A group approach me, whose dejected looks,Sad Heralds of distress! proclaim them MenBanish'd for ever and for conscience sakeFrom their distracted Country, whence the nameOf Freedom misapplied, and much abus'dBy lawless Anarchy, has driven them farTo wander; with the prejudice they learn'dFrom Bigotry (the Tut'ress of the blind),Thro' the wide World unshelter'd; their sole hope,That German spoilers, thro' that pleasant landMay carry wide the desolating scourgeOf War and Vengeance; yet unhappy Men,
Whate'er your errors, I lament your fate:And, as disconsolate and sad ye hangUpon the barrier of the rock, and seemTo murmur your despondence, waiting longSome fortunate reverse that never comes;Methinks in each expressive face, I seeDiscriminated anguish; there droops one,Who in a moping cloister long consum'dThis life inactive, to obtain a better,And thought that meagre abstinence, to wakeFrom his hard pallet with the midnight bell,To live on eleemosynary bread,And to renounce God's works, would please that God.And now the poor pale wretch receives, amaz'd,The pity, strangers give to his distress,Because these strangers are, by his dark creed,
Condemn'd as Heretics—and with sick heartRegrets2 his pious prison, and his beads.—Another, of more haughty port, declinesThe aid he needs not; while in mute despairHis high indignant thoughts go back to France,Dwelling on all he lost—the Gothic dome,That vied with splendid palaces3; the bedsOf silk and down, the silver chalices,Vestments with gold enwrought for blazing altars;Where, amid clouds of incense, he held forthTo kneeling crowds the imaginary bonesOf Saints suppos'd, in pearl and gold enchas'd,And still with more than living Monarchs' pompSurrounded; was believ'd by mumbling bigotsTo hold the keys of Heaven, and to admitWhom he thought good to share it—Now alas!
He, to whose daring soul and high ambitionThe World seem'd circumscrib'd; who, wont to dreamOf Fleuri, Richelieu, Alberoni, menWho trod on Empire, and whose politicsWere not beyond the grasp of his vast mind,Is, in a Land once hostile, still prophan'dBy disbelief, and rites un-orthodox,The object of compassion—At his side,Lighter of heart than these, but heavier farThan he was wont, another victim comes,An Abbé—who with less contracted browStill smiles and flatters, and still talks of Hope;Which, sanguine as he is, he does not feel,And so he cheats the sad and weighty pressureOf evils present;—Still, as Men misledBy early prejudice (so hard to break),
I mourn your sorrows; for I too have knownInvoluntary exile; and while yetEngland had charms for me, have felt how sadIt is to look across the dim cold sea,That melancholy rolls its refluent tidesBetween us and the dear regretted landWe call our own—as now ye pensive waitOn this bleak morning, gazing on the wavesThat seem to leave your shore; from whence the windIs loaded to your ears, with the deep groansOf martyr'd Saints and suffering Royalty,While to your eyes the avenging power of HeavenAppears in aweful anger to prepareThe storm of vengeance, fraught with plagues and death.Even he of milder heart, who was indeedThe simple shepherd in a rustic scene,
And, 'mid the vine-clad hills of Languedoc,Taught to the bare-foot peasant, whose hard handsProduc'd4 the nectar he could seldom taste,Submission to the Lord for whom he toil'd;He, or his brethren, who to Neustria's sonsEnforc'd religious patience, when, at times,On their indignant hearts Power's iron handToo strongly struck; eliciting some sparksOf the bold spirit of their native North;Even these Parochial Priests, these humbled men,Whose lowly undistinguish'd cottagesWitness'd a life of purest piety,While the meek tenants were, perhaps, unknownEach to the haughty Lord of his domain,Who mark'd them not; the Noble scorning stillThe poor and pious Priest, as with slow pace
He glided thro' the dim arch'd avenueWhich to the Castle led; hoping to cheerThe last sad hour of some laborious lifeThat hasten'd to its close—even such a ManBecomes an exile; staying not to tryBy temperate zeal to check his madd'ning flock,Who, at the novel sound of Liberty(Ah! most intoxicating sound to slaves!),Start into licence—Lo! dejected now,The wandering Pastor mourns, with bleeding heart,His erring people, weeps and prays for them,And trembles for the account that he must giveTo Heaven for souls entrusted to his care.—Where the cliff, hollow'd by the wintry storm,Affords a seat with matted sea-weed strewn,A softer form reclines; around her run,
On the rough shingles, or the chalky bourn,Her gay unconscious children, soon amus'd;Who pick the fretted stone, or glossy shell,Or crimson plant marine: or they contriveThe fairy vessel, with its ribband sailAnd gilded paper pennant: in the pool,Left by the salt wave on the yielding sands,They launch the mimic navy—Happy age!Unmindful of the miseries of Man!—Alas! too long a victim to distress,Their Mother, lost in melancholy thought,Lull'd for a moment by the murmurs lowOf sullen billows, wearied by the taskOf having here, with swol'n and aching eyesFix'd on the grey horizon, since the dawnSolicitously watch'd the weekly sail
From her dear native land, now yields awhileTo kind forgetfulness, while Fancy brings,In waking dreams, that native land again!Versailles appears—its painted galleries,And rooms of regal splendour; rich with gold,Where, by long mirrors multiply'd, the crowdPaid willing homage—and, united there,Beauty gave charms to empire—Ah! too soonFrom the gay visionary pageant rous'd,See the sad mourner start!—and, drooping, lookWith tearful eyes and heaving bosom roundOn drear reality—where dark'ning waves,Urg'd by the rising wind, unheeded foamNear her cold rugged seat:—To call her thenceA fellow-sufferer comes: dejection deepChecks, but conceals not quite, the martial air,
And that high consciousness of noble blood,Which he has learn'd from infancy to thinkExalts him o'er the race of common men:Nurs'd in the velvet lap of luxury,And fed by adulation—could he learn,That worth alone is true Nobility?And that the peasant who, "amid5 the sons"Of Reason, Valour, Liberty, and Virtue,"Displays distinguish'd merit, is a Noble"Of Nature's own creation!"—If even here,If in this land of highly vaunted Freedom,Even Britons controvert the unwelcome truth,Can it be relish'd by the sons of France?Men, who derive their boasted ancestryFrom the fierce leaders of religious wars,The first in Chivalry's emblazon'd page;
Who reckon Gueslin, Bayard, or De Foix,Among their brave Progenitors? Their eyes,Accustom'd to regard the splendid trophiesOf Heraldry (that with fantastic handMingles, like images in feverish dreams,"Gorgons and Hydras, and Chimeras dire,"With painted puns, and visionary shapes;),See not the simple dignity of Virtue,But hold all base, whom honours such as theseExalt not from the crowd6—As one, who longHas dwelt amid the artificial scenesOf populous City, deems that splendid shows,The Theatre, and pageant pomp of Courts,Are only worth regard; forgets all tasteFor Nature's genuine beauty; in the lapseOf gushing waters hears no soothing sound,
Nor listens with delight to sighing winds,That, on their fragrant pinions, waft the notesOf birds rejoicing in the trangled copse;Nor gazes pleas'd on Ocean's silver breast,While lightly o'er it sails the summer cloudsReflected in the wave, that, hardly heard,Flows on the yellow sands: so to his mind,That long has liv'd where Despotism hidesHis features harsh, beneath the diademOf worldly grandeur, abject Slavery seems,If by that power impos'd, slavery no more:For luxury wreathes with silk the iron bonds,And hides the ugly rivets with her flowers,Till the degenerate triflers, while they loveThe glitter of the chains, forget their weight.But more the Men7, whose ill acquir'd wealth
Was wrung from plunder'd myriads, by the meansToo often legaliz'd by power abus'd,Feel all the horrors of the fatal change,When their ephemeral greatness, marr'd at once(As a vain toy that Fortune's childish handEqually joy'd to fashion or to crush),Leaves them expos'd to universal scornFor having nothing else; not even the claimTo honour, which respect for Heroes pastAllows to ancient titles; Men, like these,Sink even beneath the level, whence base artsAlone had rais'd them;—unlamented sink,And know that they deserve the woes they feel.Poor wand'ring wretches! whosoe'er ye are,That hopeless, houseless, friendless, travel wideO'er these bleak russet downs; where, dimly seen,
The solitary Shepherd shiv'ring tendsHis dun discolour'd flock (Shepherd, unlikeHim, whom in song the Poet's fancy crownsWith garlands, and his crook with vi'lets binds);Poor vagrant wretches! outcasts of the world!Whom no abode receives, no parish owns;Roving, like Nature's commoners, the landThat boasts such general plenty: if the sightOf wide-extended misery softens yoursA while, suspend your murmurs!—here beholdThe strange vicissitudes of fate—while thusThe exil'd Nobles, from their country driven,Whose richest luxuries were their's, must feelMore poignant anguish, than the lowest poor,Who, born to indigence, have learn'd to braveRigid Adversity's depressing breath!—
Ah! rather Fortune's worthless favourites!Who feed on England's vitals—PensionersOf base corruption, who, in quick ascentTo opulence unmerited, becomeGiddy with pride, and as ye rise, forgettingThe dust ye lately left, with scorn look downOn those beneath ye (tho' your equals onceIn fortune, and in worth superior still,They view the eminence, on which ye stand,With wonder, not with envy; for they knowThe means, by which ye reach'd it, have been suchAs, in all honest eyes, degrade ye farBeneath the poor dependent, whose fad heartReluctant pleads for what your pride denies);Ye venal, worthless hirelings of a Court!Ye pamper'd Parasites! whom Britons pay
For forging fetters for them; rather hereStudy a lesson that concerns ye much;And, trembling, learn, that if oppress'd too long,The raging multitude, to madness stung,Will turn on their oppressors; and, no moreBy sounding titles and parading formsBound like tame victims, will redress themselves!Then swept away by the resistlefs torrent,Not only all your pomp may disappear,But, in the tempest lost, fair Order sinkHer decent head, and lawless AnarchyO'erturn celestial Freedom's radiant throne;—As now in Gallia; where Confusion, bornOf party rage and selfish love of rule,Sully the noblest cause that ever warm'dThe heart of Patriot Virtue8—There arise
The infernal passions; Vengeance, seeking blood,And Avarice; and Envy's harpy fangsPollute the immortal shrine of Liberty,Dismay her votaries, and disgrace her name.Respect is due to principle; and they,Who suffer for their conscience, have a claim,Whate'er that principle may be, to praise.These ill-starr'd Exiles then, who, bound by ties,To them the bonds of honour; who resign'dTheir country to preserve them, and now seekIn England an asylum—well deserveTo find that (every prejudice forgot,Which pride and ignorance teaches), we for themFeel as our brethren; and that English hearts,Of just compassion ever own the sway,As truly as our element, the deep,
Obeys the mild dominion of the Moon—This they have found; and may they find it still!Thus may'st thou, Britain, triumph!—May thy foes,By Reason's gen'rous potency subdued,Learn, that the God thou worshippest, delightsIn acts of pure humanity!—May thineBe still such bloodless laurels! nobler farThan those acquir'd at Cressy or Poictiers,Or of more recent growth, those well bestow'dOn him who stood on Calpe's blazing heightAmid the thunder of a warring world,Illustrious rather from the crowds he sav'dFrom flood and fire, than from the ranks who fellBeneath his valour!—Actions such as these,Like incense rising to the Throne of Heaven,Far better justify the pride, that swells
In British bosoms, than the deafening roarOf Victory from a thousand brazen throats,That tell with what success wide-wasting WarHas by our brave Compatriots thinned the world.END OF BOOK I.NOTES TO THE FIRST BOOK"ENDS the 

chace."]—I have a confused notion, 

that this expression, with nearly the same 

application, is to be found in Young: but I cannot 

refer to it."Regrets his pious 

prison and his beads."]—Lest the 

same attempts at misrepresentation should 

now be made, as have been made on former 

occasions, it is necessary to repeat, that 

nothing is farther from my thoughts, than to 

reflect invidiously on the Emigrant Clergy, 

whose steadiness of principle excites 

veneration, as much as their sufferings 

compassion. Adversity has now taught them the 

charity and humility they perhaps wanted, when they 

made it a part of their faith, that salvation 

could be obtained in no other religion than their 

own."The splendid 

palaces."]—Let it not be considered as 

an insult to men in fallen fortune, if these 

luxuries (undoubtedly inconsistent with their 

profession) be here enumerated—France is 

not the only country, where the splendour and 

indulgences of the higher, and the poverty and 

depression of the inferior Clergy, have alike 

proved injurious to the cause of Religion.See the finely 

descriptive Verses written at Montauban in 

France in 1750, by Dr. Joseph Warton. Printed in 

Dodsley's Miscellanies, Vol. IV. page 

203."Who amid the 

sons"Of Reason, Valour, Liberty, and Virtue,"Displays distinguished merit, is a 

Noble"Of Nature's own creation."]—These lines are Thomson's, and are among 

those sentiments which are now called (when 

used by living writers), not common-place 

declamation, but sentiments of dangerous 

tendency."Exalt not from the 

crowd."]—It has been said, and with 

great appearance of truth, that the contempt in 

which the Nobility of France held the common 

people, was remembered, and with all that 

vindictive asperity which long endurance of 

oppression naturally excites, when, by a 

wonderful concurrence of circumstances, the 

people acquired the power of retaliation. Yet let 

me here add, what seems to be in some degree 

inconsistent with the former charge, that the 

French are good masters to their servants, and 

that in their treatment of their Negro slaves, 

they are allowed to be more mild and merciful than 

other Europeans."But more the 

Men."]—The Financiers and Fermiers 

Generaux are here intended. In the present moment 

of clamour against all those who have spoken 

or written in favour of the first Revolution of 

France, the declaimers seem to have forgotten, 

that under the reign of a mild and easy tempered 

Monarch, in the most voluptuous Court in the 

world, the abuses by which men of this 

description were enriched, had arisen to such 

height, that their prodigality exhausted the 

immense resources of France: and, unable to 

supply the exigencies of Government, the 

Ministry were compelled to call Le Tiers Etat; a 

meeting that gave birth to the Revolution, which 

has since been so ruinously conducted."The breast of 

Patriot Virtue."]—This sentiment will 

probably renew against me the 

indignation of those, who have an interest in 

asserting that no such virtue any where 

exists.THE

afford to the South a View of the Sea; to the North of
the Weald of Sussex.TIME, an Afternoon in April, 1793.LONG wintry months are past; the Moon that nowLights her pale crescent even at noon, has madeFour times her revolution; since with step,Mournful and slow, along the wave-worn cliff,Pensive I took my solitary way,Lost in despondence, while contemplatingNot my own wayward destiny alone,(Hard as it is, and difficult to bear!)But in beholding the unhappy lot
Of the lorn Exiles; who, amid the stormsOf wild disastrous Anarchy, are thrown,Like shipwreck'd sufferers, on England's coast,To see, perhaps, no more their native land,Where Desolation riots: They, like me,From fairer hopes and happier prospects driven,Shrink from the future, and regret the past.But on this Upland scene, while April comes,With fragrant airs, to fan my throbbing breast,Fain would I snatch an interval from Care,That weighs my wearied spirit down to earth;Courting, once more, the influence of Hope(For "Hope" still waits upon the flowery prime)As here I mark Spring's humid hand unfoldThe early leaves that fear capricious winds,While, even on shelter'd banks, the timid flowers
Give, half reluctantly, their warmer huesTo mingle with the primroses' pale stars.No shade the leafless copses yet afford,Nor hide the mossy labours of the Thrush,That, startled, darts across the narrow path;But quickly re-assur'd, resumes his task,Or adds his louder notes to those that riseFrom yonder tufted brake; where the white budsOf the first thorn are mingled with the leavesOf that which blossoms on the brow of May.Ah! 'twill not be:—So many years have pass'd,Since, on my native hills, I learn'd to gazeOn these delightful landscapes; and those yearsHave taught me so much sorrow, that my soulFeels not the joy reviving Nature brings;But, in dark retrospect, dejected dwells
On human follies, and on human woes.—What is the promise of the infant year,The lively verdure, or the bursting blooms,To those, who shrink from horrors such as WarSpreads o'er the affrighted world? With swimming eye,Back on the past they throw their mournful looks,And see the Temple, which they fondly hop'dReason would raise to Liberty, destroy'dBy ruffian hands; while, on the ruin'd mass,Flush'd with hot blood, the Fiend of Discord sitsIn savage triumph; mocking every pleaOf policy and justice, as she shewsThe headless corse of one, whose only crimeWas being born a Monarch—Mercy turns,From spectacle so dire, her swol'n eyes;And Liberty, with calm, unruffled brow
Magnanimous, as conscious of her strengthIn Reason's panoply, scorns to distainHer righteous cause with carnage, and resignsTo Fraud and Anarchy the infuriate crowd.—What is the promise of the infant yearTo those, who (while the poor but peaceful hindPens, unmolested, the encreasing flockOf his rich master in this sea-fenc'd isle)Survey, in neighbouring countries, scenes that makeThe sick heart shudder; and the Man, who thinks,Blush for his species? There the trumpet's voiceDrowns the soft warbling of the woodland choir;And violets, lurking in their turfy bedsBeneath the flow'ring thorn, are stain'd with blood.There fall, at once, the spoiler and the spoil'd;While War, wide-ravaging, annihilates
The hope of cultivation; gives to Fiends,The meagre, ghastly Fiends of Want and Woe,The blasted land—There, taunting in the vanOf vengeance-breathing armies, Insult stalks;And, in the ranks, "1Famine, and Sword, and Fire,"Crouch for employment."—Lo! the suffering world,Torn by the fearful conflict, shrinks, amaz'd,From Freedom's name, usurp'd and misapplied,And, cow'ring to the purple Tyrant's rod,Deems that the lesser ill—Deluded Men!Ere ye prophane her ever-glorious name,Or catalogue the thousands that have bledResisting her; or those, who greatly diedMartyrs to Liberty—revert awhileTo the black scroll, that tells of regal crimesCommitted to destroy her; rather count
The hecatombs of victims, who have fallenBeneath a single despot; or who gaveTheir wasted lives for some disputed claimBetween anointed robbers:2Monsters both!"3Oh! Polish'd perturbation—golden care!"So strangely coveted by feeble ManTo lift him o'er his fellows;—Toy, for whichSuch showers of blood have drench'd th' affrighted earth—Unfortunate his lot, whose luckless headThy jewel'd circlet, lin'd with thorns, has bound;And who, by custom's laws, obtains from theeHereditary right to rule, uncheck'd,Submissive myriads: for untemper'd power,Like steel ill form'd, injures the handIt promis'd to protect—Unhappy France!If e'er thy lilies, trampled now in dust,
And blood-bespotted, shall again reviveIn silver splendour, may the wreath be wov'nBy voluntary hands; and Freemen, suchAs England's self might boast, unite to placeThe guarded diadem on his fair brow,Where Loyalty may join with LibertyTo fix it firmly.—In the rugged schoolOf stern Adversity so early train'd,His future life, perchance, may emulateThat of the brave Bernois4, so justly call'dThe darling of his people; who rever'dThe Warrior less, than they ador'd the Man!But ne'er may Party Rage, perverse and blind,And base Venality, prevail to raiseTo public trust, a wretch, whose private viceMakes even the wildest profligate recoil;
And who, with hireling ruffians leagu'd, has burstThe laws of Nature and Humanity!Wading, beneath the Patriot's specious mask,And in Equality's illusive name,To empire thro' a stream of kindred blood—Innocent prisoner!—most unhappy heirOf fatal greatness, who art suffering nowFor all the crimes and follies of thy race;Better for thee, if o'er thy baby browThe regal mischief never had been held:Then, in an humble sphere, perhaps content,Thou hadst been free and joyous on the heightsOf Pyrennean mountains, shagg'd with woodsOf chesnut, pine, and oak: as on these hillsIs yonder little thoughtless shepherd lad,Who, on the slope abrupt of downy turf
Reclin'd in playful indolence, sends offThe chalky ball, quick bounding far below;While, half forgetful of his simple task,Hardly his length'ning shadow, or the bells'Slow tinkling of his flock, that supping tendTo the brown fallows in the vale beneath,Where nightly it is folded, from his sportRecal the happy idler.—While I gazeOn his gay vacant countenance, my thoughtsCompare with his obscure, laborious lot,Thine, most unfortunate, imperial Boy!Who round thy sullen prison daily hear'stThe savage howl of Murder, as it seeksThy unoffending life: while sad withinThy wretched Mother, petrified with grief,Views thee with stony eyes, and cannot weep!—
Ah! much I mourn thy sorrows, hapless Queen!And deem thy expiation made to HeavenFor every fault, to which ProsperityBetray'd thee, when it plac'd thee on a throneWhere boundless power was thine, and thou wert rais'dHigh (as it seem'd) above the envious reachOf destiny! Whate'er thy errors were,Be they no more remember'd; tho' the rageOf Party swell'd them to such crimes, as badeCompassion stifle every sigh that roseFor thy disastrous lot—More than enoughThou hast endur'd; and every English heart,Ev'n those, that highest beat in Freedom's cause,Disclaim as base, and of that cause unworthy,The Vengeance, or the Fear, that makes thee stillA miserable prisoner!—Ah! who knows,
From sad experience, more than I, to feelFor thy desponding spirit, as it sinksBeneath procrastinated fears for thoseMore dear to thee than life! But eminenceOf misery is thine, as once of joy;And, as we view the strange vicissitude,We ask anew, where happiness is found?—Alas! in rural life, where youthful dreamsSee the Arcadia that Romance describes,Not even Content resides!—In yon low hutOf clay and thatch, where rises the grey smokeOf smold'ring turf, cut from the adjoining moor,The labourer, its inhabitant, who toilsFrom the first dawn of twilight, till the SunSinks in the rosy waters of the West,Finds that with poverty it cannot dwell;
For bread, and scanty bread, is all he earnsFor him and for his household—Should Disease,Born of chill wintry rains, arrest his arm,Then, thro' his patch'd and straw-stuff'd casement, peepsThe squalid figure of extremest Want;And from the Parish the reluctant dole,Dealt by th' unfeeling farmer, hardly savesThe ling'ring spark of life from cold extinction:Then the bright Sun of Spring, that smiling bidsAll other animals rejoice, beholds,Crept from his pallet, the emaciate wretchAttempt, with feeble effort, to resumeSome heavy task, above his wasted strength,Turning his wistful looks (how much in vain!)To the deserted mansion, where no moreThe owner (gone to gayer scenes) resides,
Who made even luxury, Virtue; while he gaveThe scatter'd crumbs to honest Poverty.—But, tho' the landscape be too oft deform'dBy figures such as these, yet Peace is here,And o'er our vallies, cloath'd with springing corn,No hostile hoof shall trample, nor fierce flamesWither the wood's young verdure, ere it formGradual the laughing May's luxuriant shade;For, by the rude sea guarded, we are safe,And feel not evils such as with deep sighsThe Emigrants deplore, as they recalThe Summer past, when Nature seem'd to loseHer course in wild distemperature, and aid,With seasons all revers'd, destructive War.Shuddering, I view the pictures they have drawnOf desolated countries, where the ground,
Stripp'd of its unripe produce, was thick strewnWith various Death—the war-horse falling thereBy famine, and his rider by the sword.The moping clouds sail'd heavy charg'd with rain,And bursting o'er the mountains misty brow,Deluged, as with an inland sea, the vales5;Where, thro' the sullen evening's lurid gloom,Rising, like columns of volcanic fire,The flames of burning villages illum'dThe waste of water; and the wind, that howl'dAlong its troubled surface, brought the groansOf plunder'd peasants, and the frantic shrieksOf mothers for their children; while the brave,To pity still alive, listen'd aghastTo these dire echoes, hopeless to preventThe evils they beheld, or check the rage,
Which ever, as the people of one landMeet in contention, fires the human heartWith savage thirst of kindred blood, and makesMan lose his nature; rendering him more fierceThan the gaunt monsters of the howling waste.Oft have I heard the melancholy tale,Which, all their native gaiety forgot,These Exiles tell—How Hope impell'd them on,Reckless of tempest, hunger, or the sword,Till order'd to retreat, they knew not why,From all their flattering prospects, they becameThe prey of dark suspicion and regret6:Then, in despondence, sunk the unnerv'd armOf gallant Loyalty—At every turnShame and disgrace appear'd, and seem'd to mockTheir scatter'd squadrons; which the warlike youth,
Unable to endure7, often implor'd,As the last act of friendship, from the handOf some brave comrade, to receive the blowThat freed the indignant spirit from its pain.To a wild mountain, whose bare summit hidesIts broken eminence in clouds; whose steepsAre dark with woods; where the receding rocksAre worn by torrents of dissolving snow,A wretched Woman, pale and breathless, flies!And, gazing round her, listens to the soundOf hostile footsteps—No! it dies away:Nor noise remains, but of the cataract,Or surly breeze of night, that mutters lowAmong the thickets, where she trembling seeksA temporary shelter—clasping closeTo her hard-heaving heart her sleeping child,
All she could rescue of the innocent groupeThat yesterday surrounded her—Escap'dAlmost by miracle! Fear, frantic Fear,Wing'd her weak feet: yet, half repentant nowHer headlong haste, she wishes she had staidTo die with those affrighted Fancy paintsThe lawless soldier's victims—Hark! againThe driving tempest bears the cry of Death,And, with deep sullen thunder, the dread soundOf cannon vibrates on the tremulous earth;While, bursting in the air, the murderous bombGlares o'er her mansion. Where the splinters fall,Like scatter'd comets, its destructive pathIs mark'd by wreaths of flame!—Then, overwhelm'dBeneath accumulated horror, sinksThe desolate mourner; yet, in Death itself,
True to maternal tenderness, she triesTo save the unconscious infant from the stormIn which she perishes; and to protectThis last dear object of her ruin'd hopesFrom prowling monsters, that from other hills,More inaccessible, and wilder wastes,Lur'd by the scent of slaughter, follow fierceContending hosts, and to polluted fieldsAdd dire increase of horrors—But alas!The Mother and the Infant perish both!—The feudal Chief, whose Gothic battlementsFrown on the plain beneath, returning homeFrom distant lands, alone and in disguise,Gains at the fall of night his Castle walls,But, at the vacant gate, no Porter sitsTo wait his Lord's admittance!—In the courts
All is drear silence!—Guessing but too wellThe fatal truth, he shudders as he goesThro' the mute hall; where, by the blunted lightThat the dim moon thro' painted casements lends,He sees that devastation has been there:Then, while each hideous image to his mindRises terrific, o'er a bleeding corseStumbling he falls; another interruptsHis staggering feet—all, all who us'd to rushWith joy to meet him—all his familyLie murder'd in his way!—And the day dawnsOn a wild raving Maniac, whom a fateSo sudden and calamitous has robb'dOf reason; and who round his vacant wallsScreams unregarded, and reproaches Heaven!—Such are thy dreadful trophies, savage War!
And evils such as these, or yet more dire,Which the pain'd mind recoils from, all are thine—The purple Pestilence, that to the graveSends whom the sword has spar'd, is thine; and thineThe Widow's anguish and the Orphan's tears!—Woes such as these does Man inflict on Man;And by the closet murderers, whom we styleWise Politicians, are the schemes prepar'd,Which, to keep Europe's wavering balance even,Depopulate her kingdoms, and consignTo tears and anguish half a bleeding world!—Oh! could the time return, when thoughts like theseSpoil'd not that gay delight, which vernal Suns,Illuminating hills, and woods, and fields,Gave to my infant spirits—Memory come!And from distracting cares, that now deprive
Such scenes of all their beauty, kindly bearMy fancy to those hours of simple joy,When, on the banks of Arun, which I seeMake its irriguous course thro' yonder meads,I play'd; unconscious then of future ill!There (where, from hollows fring'd with yellow broom,The birch with silver rind, and fairy leaf,Aslant the low stream trembles) I have stood,And meditated how to venture bestInto the shallow current, to procureThe willow herb of glowing purple spikes,Or flags, whose sword-like leaves conceal'd the tide,Startling the timid reed-bird from her nest,As with aquatic flowers I wove the wreath,Such as, collected by the shepherd girls,Deck in the villages the turfy shrine,
And mark the arrival of propitious May.—How little dream'd I then the time would come,When the bright Sun of that delicious monthShould, from disturb'd and artificial sleep,Awaken me to never-ending toil,To terror and to tears!—Attempting still,With feeble hands and cold desponding heart,To save my children from the o'erwhelming wrongs,That have for ten long years been heap'd on me!—The fearful spectres of chicane and fraudHave, Proteus like, still chang'd their hideous forms(As the Law lent its plausible disguise),Pursuing my faint steps; and I have seenFriendship's sweet bonds (which were so early form'd,)And once I fondly thought of amaranthInwove with silver seven times tried) give way,
And fail; as these green fan-like leaves of fernWill wither at the touch of Autumn's frost.Yet there are those, whose patient pity stillHears my long murmurs; who, unwearied, tryWith lenient hands to bind up every woundMy wearied spirit feels, and bid me go"Right onward"—a calm votary of the Nymph,Who, from her adamantine rock, points outTo conscious rectitude the rugged path,That leads at length to Peace!—Ah! yes, my friendsPeace will at last be mine; for in the GraveIs Peace—and pass a few short years, perchanceA few short months, and all the various painI now endure shall be forgotten there,And no memorial shall remain of me,Save in your bosoms; while even your regret
Shall lose its poignancy, as ye reflectWhat complicated woes that grave conceals!But, if the little praise, that may awaitThe Mother's efforts, should provoke the spleenOf Priest or Levite; and they then arraignThe dust that cannot hear them; be it yoursTo vindicate my humble fame; to say,That, not in selfish sufferings absorb'd,"I gave to misery all I had, my tears8."And if, where regulated sanctityPours her long orisons to Heaven, my voiceWas seldom heard, that yet my prayer was madeTo him who hears even silence; not in domesOf human architecture, fill'd with crowds,But on these hills, where boundless, yet distinct,Even as a map, beneath are spread the fieldsHis bounty cloaths; divided here by woods,
And there by commons rude, or winding brooks,While I might breathe the air perfum'd with flowers,Or the fresh odours of the mountain turf;And gaze on clouds above me, as they sail'dMajestic: or remark the reddening north,When bickering arrows of electric fireFlash on the evening sky—I made my prayerIn unison with murmuring waves that nowSwell with dark tempests, now are mild and blue,As the bright arch above; for all to meDeclare omniscient goodness; nor need IDeclamatory essays to inciteMy wonder or my praise, when every leafThat Spring unfolds, and every simple bud,More forcibly impresses on my heartHis power and wisdom—Ah! while I adoreThat goodness, which design'd to all that lives
Some taste of happiness, my soul is pain'dBy the variety of woes that ManFor Man creates—his blessings often turn'dTo plagues and curses: Saint-like Piety,Misled by Superstition, has destroy'dMore than Ambition; and the sacred flameOf Liberty becomes a raging fire,When Licence and Confusion bid it blaze.From thy high throne, above yon radiant stars,O Power Omnipotent! with mercy viewThis suffering globe, and cause thy creatures cease,With savage fangs, to tear her bleeding breast:Restrain that rage for power, that bids a Man,Himself a worm, desire unbounded ruleO'er beings like himself: Teach the hard heartsOf rulers, that the poorest hind, who diesFor their unrighteous quarrels, in thy sight
Is equal to the imperious Lord, that leadsHis disciplin'd destroyers to the field.—May lovely Freedom, in her genuine charms,Aided by stern but equal Justice, driveFrom the ensanguin'd earth the hell-born fiendsOf Pride, Oppression, Avarice, and Revenge,That ruin what thy mercy made so fair!Then shall these ill-starr'd wanderers, whose sad fateThese desultory lines lament, regainTheir native country; private vengeance thenTo public virtue yield; and the fierce feuds,That long have torn their desolated land,May (even as storms, that agitate the air,Drive noxious vapours from the blighted earth)Serve, all tremendous as they are, to fixThe reign of Reason, Liberty, and Peace!NOTES TO THE SECOND BOOK"HOPE waits upon

the heavy and incessant rains during the last 

campaign, the armies were often compelled to march 

for many miles through marshes overflowed; 

suffering the extremities of cold and fatigue. 

The peasants frequently misled them; and, after 

having passed these inundations at the hazard 

of their lives, they were sometimes under the 

necessity of crossing them a second and a 

third time; their evening quarters after such a 

day of exertion were often in a wood without 

shelter; and their repast, instead of bread, 

unripe corn, without any other preparation than 

being mashed into a sort of paste."The prey of dark

remarkable, that notwithstanding the 

excessive hardships to which the army of the 

Emigrants was exposed, very few in it suffered 

from disease till they began to retreat; then 

it was that despondence consigned to the most

better fate; and then despair impelled some to 

suicide, while others fell by mutual wounds, 

unable to survive disappointment and 

humiliation."Right
