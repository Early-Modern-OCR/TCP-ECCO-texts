'tis true.V.Some said that Dgls sent should be,Some talk'd of Wlkr's Merit,But most held, in this Midwifery,No Doctor like a FERRET.VI.But Mlnx, who heard this told,(Right wary He and wise)Cry'd sagely, 'Tis not safe, I hold,To trust to Dnt's Eyes.VII.A Vow to God He then did makeHe would himself go down,St. Adre too, the Scale to takeOf that Phoenomenon.VIII.He order'd then his Coach and Four;(The Coach was quickly got 'em)Resolv'd this Secret to explore,And search it to the Bottom.IX.At Godliman they now arrive,For Haste they made exceeding;As Courtiers should, whene'er they striveTo be inform'd of Breeding.X.The good Wife to the Surgeon sent,And said to him, Good Neighbour,'Tis pity that two Suqires so Gent—should come and lose their Labour.XI.The Surgeon with a Rabbit came,But first in Pieces cut it;Then slyly thrust it up that same,As far as Man could put it.XII.(Ye Guildford Inn-keepers take heedYou dress not such a Rabbit,Ye Poult'rers eke, destroy the Breed,'Tis so unsav'ry a-Bit.)XIII.But hold! says Molly, first let's try,Now that her Legs are ope,If ought within we may descryBy Help of Telescope.XIV.The Instrument himself did make,He rais'd and level'd right,But all about was so opake,It could not aid his Sight.XV.On Tiptoe then the Squire he stood,(But first He gave Her Money)Then reach'd as high as e'er He cou'd,And cry'd, I feel a CONY.XVI.Is it alive? St. Adre cry'd;It is; I feel it stir.Is it full grown? the Squire reply'd;It is; see here's the FUR.XVII.And now two Legs St. Adre got,And then came two Legs more;Now fell the Head to Molly's Lot,And so the Work was o'er.XVIII.The Woman, thus being brought to Bed,Said, to reward your Pains,St. Andre shall dissect the Head,And thou shalt have the Brains.XIX.He lap'd it in a Linnen Rag,Then thank'd Her for Her Kindness;And cram'd it in the Velvet BagThat serves his Rl HXX.That Bag—which Jenny, wanton Slut,First brought to foul Disgrace;Stealing the Papers thence she putVeal-Cutlets in their Place.XXI.O! happy would it be, I ween,Could they these Rabbits smother;Molly had ne'er a Midwife been,Nor she a shameful Mother.XXII.Why has the Proverb falsly saidBetter two Heads than one;Could Molly hide this Rabbit's Head,He still might shew his own.FINIS.
