[Entered at Stationers Hall.]THE GOOD MILITIA MAN, &c.I.I WAS a Plough-boy tall Sir;My name was honest Dan;But at my country's call, Sir,I've turn'd Militia Man.II.So on our little green, Sir,Away from all the mire,I daily now am seen, Sir,To cock, present, and fire.III.In Regimentals bright, Sir,Of Scarlet I do shine,With hair tied up so tight, Sir,And whiten'd all so fine.IV.Of Maidens not a few, SirCome crouding round the green;And so do Parents too, Sir;The Children push between.V.There like a Soldier prime, Sir,I march both quick and flow;I stamp my foot in time, Sir,And then kick up my toe.VI.Mean while, with sound so grand, Sir,They beat the Rum—drum—drum;Till all our valiant Band, Sir,Do wish the French would come.VII.But stop—methinks 'tis wrong, Sir,To talk this swelling stuff;For no true Soldier's song, SirShould deal in empty puff.VIII.I'll give you then a spice, Sir(Oh now you'll like my plan)Of sound and good advice, SirFor each Militia Man.IX.First then, be sound at heart, Sir,Be loyal, says my Song;And nobly act your part, SirTo right your Country's wrong.X.Yet let no Soldier hold, Sir,He merely need be stout,And blunt and brave and bold, Sir,And mad to fight it out;XI.Your Soldier of true stamp, SirIs not like brutish Cattle;And he'll be good in camp, Sir,As well as good in battle.XII.Unlike the looser herd, SirEach vice he'll try to crush;Nor will he speak a word, SirTo make a Maiden blush.XIII.Nor will he shew his spunk, Sir,By turning jolly fellow;He never will be drunk, Sir,No, no—nor yet be mellow.XIV.He counts it quite a shame, SirTo hear a Soldier swear;'Tis what King George would blame, Sir,No doubt if he was there.XV.Nor does he laugh and grin, Sir.At these as petty things;Your swearing is a sin, SirAgainst the King of Kings.XVI.For be it understood, SirHe says with honest Dan,"The Soldier can't be good, SirWhile wicked is the Man."XVII.Now should some saucy Tongue, Sir,Here stop me for a Toast,I'll give the Man I've sung, Sir,"The Man that's worth a host."Z.THE END.
