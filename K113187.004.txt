THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH POETRY.SECT. XLIV.MORE poetry was written in the single reign of Elizabeth, than in the two preceding centuries. The same causes, among others already enumerated and explained, which called forth genius and imagination, such as the new sources of fiction opened by a study of the classics, a familiarity with the French Italian and Spanish writers, the growing elegancies of the English language, the diffusion of polished manners, the felicities of long peace and public prosperity, and a certain freedom and activity of mind which immediately followed the national emancipation from superstition, contributed also to produce innumerable compositions in poetry. In prosecuting my further examination of the poetical annals of this reign, it thereore becomes necessary to reduce such a latitude of materials to some sort of methodical arrangement. On which account, I shall class and consider the poets of this reign, under the general heads, or divisions, of SATIRE, SONNET, PASTORAL, and MISCELLANEOUS poetry. Spenser will stand alone, without a class, and without a rival.
Satire, specifically so called, did not commence in England till the latter end of the reign of queen Elizabeth. We have seen, indeed, that eclogues, and allegories were made the vehicle of satire, and that many poems of a satirical tendency had been published, long ago. And here, the censure was rather confined to the corruptions of the clergy, than extended to popular follies and vices. But the first professed English satirist, to speak technically, is bishop Joseph Hall, successively bishop of Exeter and Norwich, born at Bristow-park within the parish of Ashby de la Zouch in Leicestershire, in the year 1574, and at the age of fifteen, in the year 1588, admitted into Emanuel-college at Cambridge, where he remained about eight years. He soon became eminent in the theology of those times, preached against predestination before prince Henry with unrivalled applause, and discussed the doctrines of Arminianism in voluminous dissertations. But so variable are our studies, and so fickle is opinion, that the poet is better known to posterity than the prelate or the polemic. His satires have outlived his sermons at court, and his laborious confutations of the Brownists. One of his later controversial tracts is, however, remembered on account of the celebrity of its antagonist. When Milton descended from his dignity to plead the cause of fanaticism and ideal liberty, bishop Hall was the defender of our hierarchical establishment. Bayle, who knew Hall only as a theologist, seems to have written his life merely because he was one of the English divines at the Synod of Dort, in 1618. From his inflexible and conscientious attachment to the royal and episcopal cause under king Charles the first, he suffered in his old age the severities of imprisonment and sequestration; and lived to see his cathedral converted into a barrack, and his palace into an ale-house. His uncommon learning was meliorated with great penetration and knowledge of the world, and his mildness of manners and his humility were characteristical. He died, and was obscurely buried without a memorial on his grave, in 1656, and in his eighty second

year, at Heigham a small village near Norwich, where he had sought shelter from the storms of usurpation, and the intolerance of presbyterianism.I have had the good fortune to see bishop Hall's funeralsermon, preached some days after his interment, on the thirtieth day of September, 1656, at saint Peter's church in Norwich, by one John Whitefoote, Master of Arts, and rector of Heigham. The preacher, no contemptible orator, before he proceeds to draw a parallel between our prelate and the patriarch Israel, thus illustrates that part of his character with which we are chiefly concerned, and which I am now hastening to consider. "Two yeares together he was chosen rhetorick professor in the universitie of Cambridge, and performed the office with extraordinary applause. He was noted for a singular wit from his youth: a most acute rhetorician, and an elegant poet. He understood many tongues; and in the rhetorick of his own, he was second to none that lived in his time Fol. 3.." It is much to our present purpose to observe, that the style of his prose is strongly tinctured with the manner of Seneca. The writer of the satires is perceptible in some of his gravest polemical or scriptural treatises; which are perpetually interspersed with excursive illustrations, familiar allusions, and observations on life. Many of them were early translated into French; and their character is well drawn by himself, in a dedication to James the first, who perhaps would have much better relished a more sedate and profound theology. "Seldome any man hath offered to your royall hands a greater bundle of his owne thoughts, nor perhaps more varietie of discourse. For here shall your maiestie find Moralitie, like a good handmaid, waiting on Divinitie: and Divinitie, like some great lady, euery day in seuerall dresses. Speculation interchanged with experience, Positiue theology with polemical, textuall with discursorie, popular with scholasticall WORKS, Lond. 1628. sol. vol. i. p. 3.."
At the age of twenty-three, while a student at Emanuelcollege, and in the year 1597, he published at London three Books of anonymous Satires, which he called Toothless SATYRS, poetical, academical, moralIn small duodecimo, Wh. Let. But see the Catalogue to Mr. Capell's SHAKESPERIANA, given to Trinity college Cambridge, NUM. 347. "Virgidemiarum, libri 6. Satires, Hall. 1597, 80.". They were printed by Thomas Creede for Robert Dexter, and are not recited in the registers of the Stationers of London. The following year, and licenced by the stationers, three more books appeared, entitled, "VIRGIDEMIARUM, The three last Bookes of Byting Satyres." These are without his name, and were printed by Richard Bradock for Robert Dexter, in the size and letter of the last In pages 106. With vignettes. Entered, March 30, 1598, to R. Dexter. REGISTR. STATION. C. f. 33. a. Ames recites an edition of all the SIX BOOKS, in 68 pages, in 1598. HIST. PRINT. p. 434. I suspect this to be a mistake.. All the six Books were printed together in 1599, in the same form, with this title, "VIRGIDEMIARUM, The three last Bookes of byting Satyres corrected and amended with some additions by J. H. [John Hall.] LONDON, for R. Dexter, &c. 1599." A most incomprehensive and inaccurate title: for this edition, the last and the best, contains the three first as well as the three last Books A modern edition, however, a thin duodecimo, was printed at Oxford, for R. Clements, 1753, under the direction of Mr. Thomson, late fellow of Queen's college Oxford. The editors followed an edition bought from Lord Oxford's library, which they destroyed, when the new one was finished.. It begins with the first three books: then at the end of the third book, follow the three last, but preceded by a new title, "VIRGIDEMIARUM. The three last Bookes, of byting Satyres. Corrected and amended with some additions by J. H." For R. Dexter, as before, 1599. But the seventh of the fourth Book is here made a second satire to the sixth or last Book. Annexed are, "Certaine worthye manvscript poems of great antiquitie reserued long since in the studie of a Northfolke gentleman, And now first published by J. S. I. The stately tragedy of Guistard and Sismond. II. The Northerne mother's blessing.
III. The way to Thrifte. Imprinted at London for R. D. 1597." Dedicated, "to the worthiest poet Maister Ed. Spenser." To this identical impression of Hall's Satires, and the Norfolk gentleman's manuscript poems annexed, a false title appeared in 1602, "VIRGIDEMIARUM. Sixe Bookes. First three bookes, Of toothlesse Satyrs. 1. POETICALL. 2. ACADEMICALL. 3. MORAL. London, Printed by John Harison, for Robert Dexter, 1602." All that follows is exactly what is in the edition of 1599. By VIRGIDEMIA, an uncouth and uncommon word, we are to understand a Gathering or Harvest of rods, in reference to the nature of the subject.These satires are marked with a classical precision, to which English poetry had yet rarely attained. They are replete with animation of style and sentiment. The indignation of the satirist is always the result of good sense. Nor are the thorns of severe invective unmixed with the flowers of pure poetry. The characters are delineated in strong and lively colouring, and their discriminations are touched with the masterly traces of genuine humour. The versification is equally energetic and elegant, and the fabric of the couplets approaches to the modern standard. It is no inconsiderable proof of a genius predominating over the general taste of an age when every preacher was a punster, to have written verses, where laughter was to be raised, and the reader to be entertained with sallies of pleasantry, without quibbles and conceits. His chief fault is obscurity, arising from a remote phraseology, constrained combinations, unfamiliar allusions, elleiptical apostrophes, and abruptness of expression. Perhaps some will think, that his manner betrays too much of the laborious exactness and pedantic anxiety of the scholar and the student. Ariosto in Italian, and Regnier in French, were now almost the only modern writers of satire: and I believe there had been an English translation of Ariosto's satires. But Hall's acknowledged patterns are Juvenal and Persius, not without some touches of

the urbanity of Horace. His parodies of these poets, or rather his adaptations of antient to modern manners, a mode of imitation not unhappily practiced by Oldham, Rochester, and Pope, discover great facility and dexterity of invention. The moral gravity and the censorial declamation of Juvenal, he frequently enlivens with a train of more refined reflection, or adorns with a novelty and variety of images.In the opening of his general PROLOGUE, he expresses a decent consciousness of the difficulty and danger of his new undertaking. The laurel which he sought had been unworn, and it was not to be won without hazard.I FIRST ADVENTURE, with fool-hardy might,To tread the steps of perilous despight:I FIRST ADVENTURE, follow me who list,And be the SECOND ENGLISH SATIRIST.His first book, containing nine satires, is aimed at the numerous impotent yet fashionable scribblers with which his age was infested. It must be esteemed a curious and valuable picture, drawn from real life, of the abuses of poetical composition which then prevailed; and which our author has at once exposed with the wit of a spirited satirist, and the good taste of a judicious critic. Of Spenser, who could not have been his cotemporary at Cambridge, as some have thought, but perhaps was his friend, he constantly speaks with respect and applause.I avail myself of a more minute analysis of this Book, not only as displaying the critical talents of our satirist, but as historical of the poetry of the present period, and illustrative of my general subject. And if in general, I should be thought too copious and prolix in my examination of these satires, my apology must be, my wish to revive a neglected writer of real genius, and my opinion, that the first legitimate author in our language of a species of poetry of the most important and

popular utility, which our countrymen have so successfully cultivated, and from which Pope derives his chief celebrity, deserved to be distinguished with a particular degree of attention.From the first satire, which I shall exhibit at length, we learn what kinds of pieces were then most in fashion, and in what manner they were written. They seem to have been, tales of love and chivalry, amatorial sonnets, tragedies, comedies, and pastorals.Nor ladie's wanton loue, nor wandering knight,Legend I out in rimes all richly dight:Nor fright the reader, with the pagan vauntOf mightie Mahound, and great Termagaunt Saracen divinities..Nor list I sonnet of my mistress' face,To paint some BlowesseIn modern ballads, Blousilinda, or Blousibella. Doctor Johnson interprets BLOWZE, a ruddy fat-faced wench. DICT. in V. with a borrow'd grace.Nor can I bideAbide, bear, endure. to pen some hungriePerhaps the true reading is angrie, that is, impassioned. These satires have been most carelessly printed. sceneFor thick-skin ears, and undiscerning eene:Nor euer could my scornfull Muse abideWith tragicke shoesBuskins. her anckles for to hide.Nor can I crouch, and withe my fawning tayle,To some great patron, for my best auayle.Such hunger-starven trencher poetrie Poetry written by hirelings for bread.,Or let it neuer liue, or timely die!Nor vnder euerie bank, and euerie tree,Speake rimes vnto mine oaten minstrelsie:Nor carol our so pleasing liuely laiesAs might the Graces moue my mirth to praise Perhaps this couplet means Comedy..
Trumpet, and reeds, and socks, and buskins fine,I them bequeathe Heroic poetry, pastorals, comedy, and tragedy, I leave to the celebrated established masters in those different kinds of composition, such as Spensor and Shakespeare. Unless the classic poets are intended. The imitation from Persius's PROLOGUE is obvious., whose statues th' wandring twineOf iuie, mix'd with bayes, circles around,Their liuing temples likewise lawrel-bound.Rather had I, albe in careless rimes,Check the misorder'd world, and lawless times.Nor need I craue the Muse's midwifry,To bring to birth so worthless poetry.Or, if we list Or, even if I was willing to invoke a muse, &c., what baser Muse can bideTo sit and sing by Granta's naked side?They haunt the tided Thames and salt Medway,Eer since the fame of their late bridal day.Nought have we here but willow-shaded shore,To tell our Grant his bankes are left forlore B. i. 1. f. 1. edit. 1599..The compliment in the close to Spenser, is introduced and turned with singular address and elegance. The allusion is to Spenser's beautiful episode of the marriage of Thames and Medway, recently published, in 1595, in the fourth book of the second part of the FAIRY QUEEN B. iv. C. xi.. But had I, says the poet, been inclined to invoke the assistance of a Muse, what Muse, even of a lower order, is there now to be found, who would condescend to sit and sing on the desolated margin of the Cam? The Muses frequent other rivers, ever since Spenser celebrated the nuptials of Thames and Medway. Cam has now nothing on his banks but willows, the types of desertion.I observe here in general, that Thomas Hudson and Henry Lock, were the Bavius and Mevius of this age. In the RETURN FROM PARNASSUS, 1606, they are thus consigned to oblivion by Judicio. "Locke and Hudson, sleep you quiet

shavers among the shavings of the press, and let your books lie in some old nook amongst old boots and shoes, so you may avoid my censure A. i. S. ii.." Hudson translated into English Du Bartas's poem of JUDITH AND HOLOFERNES, in which is this couplet.
And at her eare a pearle of greater valewThere hung, than that th' Egyptian queene did swallow.
Yet he is commended by Harrington for making this translation in a "verie good and sweet English verse Transl. ORL. FUR. Notes, B. xxxv. p. 296. 1633. Hence, or from an old Play, the name HOLOFERNES got into Shakespeare.," and is largely cited in ENGLAND'S PARNASSUS, 1600. Lock applied the Sonnet to a spiritual purpose, and substituting christian love in the place of amorous passion, made it the vehicle of humiliation, holy comfort, and thanksgiving. This book he dedicated, under the title of the PASSIONATE PRESENT to queen Elizabeth, who perhaps from the title expected to be entertained with a subject of very different nature I have before cited this Collection, which appeared in 1597, vol. iii. 445. That was a second edition. To his ECCLESIASTES there is a recommendatory poem by Lilly. Some of David's Psalms in verse appear with his name the same year..In the second satire, our author poetically laments that the nine Muses are no longer vestal virgins.Whilom the Muses nine were vestal maides,And held their temple in the secret shadesOf faire Parnassvs, that two-headed hillWhose avncient fame the southern world did fill:And in the stead of their eternal fameWas the cool stream, that took his endless nameFrom out the fertile hoof of winged steed:There did they sit, and do their holy deedThat pleas'd both heaven and earth.—He complains, that the rabble of rymesters new have engrafted the myrtle on the bay; and that poetry, departing from its antient moral tendency, has been unnaturally perverted to the

purposes of corruption and impurity. The Muses have changed, in defiance of chastity,
Their modest stole to garish looser weed,Deckt with loue-fauours, their late whoredom's meed.
While the pellucid spring of Pyrene is converted into a poisonous and muddy puddle.—Whose infectious staineCorrupteth all the lowly fruitfull plaine B. i. 2. f. 4..Marlow's OVID'S ELEGIES, and some of the dissolute sallies of Green and Nash, seem to be here pointed out. I know not of any edition of Marston's PYGMALION'S IMAGE before the year 1598, and the CALTHA POETARUM, or BUMBLE-BEE, one of the most exceptionable books of this kind, written by T. Cutwode, appeared in 1599 To R. Olave, April 17, 1599. REGISTR. STATION. C. f. 50. b.. Shakespeare's VENUS AND ADONIS, published in 1593, had given great offence to the graver readers of English verse This we learn from a poem entitled, "A Scourge for Paper-persecutors, by J.

K. 3.TO MASTER WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.Shakespeare, that nimble Mercury thy braine, &c.Who list reade lust, there's VENUS AND ADONIS,True model of a most lasciuious letcher..In the subsequent satire, our author more particularly censures the intemperance of his brethren; and illustrates their absolute inability to write, till their imaginations were animated by wine, in the following apt and witty comparison, which is worthy of Young.As frozen dunghills in a winter's morn,That void of vapours seemed all beforn,Soon as the sun sends out his piercing beams,Exhale forth filthy smoak, and stinking steams;So doth the base and the fore-barren brain,Soon as the raging wine begins to raign.In the succeeding lines, he confines his attack to Marlow, eminent for his drunken frolicks, who was both a player and a poet, and whose tragedy of TAMERLANE THE GREAT, represented before the year 1588, published in 1590, and confessedly one of the worst of his plays, abounds in bombast. Its false splendour was also burlesqued by Beaumont and Fletcher in the COXCOMB; and it has these two lines, which are ridiculed by Pistol, in Shakespeare's KING HENRY THE FOURTH A. ii. S. iv., addressed to the captive princes who drew Tamerlane's chariot.
Holla, you pamper'd jades of Asia,What, can ye draw but twenty miles a day?
We should, in the mean time, remember, that by many of the most skilful of our dramatic writers, tragedy was now thought almost essentially and solely to consist, in the pomp of declamation, in sounding expressions, and unnatural amplifications of style. But to proceed.One, higher pitch'd, doth set his soaring thoughtOn crowned kings that fortune low hath brought;Or some vpreared high-aspiring swaine,As it might be the Turkish Tamberlaine There is a piece entered to R. Jones, Aug. 14. 1590, entitled, "Comicall discourses of Tamberlain the Cithian [Scythian] shepherd." REGISTR. STATION. B. f. 262. b. Probably the story of Tamerlane was introduced into our early drama from the following publication, "The historie of the great emperour Tamerlane, drawn from the antient monuments of the Arabians. By messire Jean du Bec, abbot of Mortimer. Translated into English by H. M. London, for W. Ponsonbie, 1597." 4to. I cite from a second edition.:
Then weeneth he his base drink-drowned sprightRapt to the threefold loft of heauen's hight:When he conceiues upon his faigned stageThe stalking steps of his great personageGraced with huff cap termes, and thundering threats,That his poor hearers hair qvite vpright sets,So soon as some braue minded hungrie youthSees fitly frame to his wide-strained mouth,He vaunts his voice vpon a hired stage,With high-set steps, and princelie carriage.—There if he can with termes Italianate,Big-sounding sentences, and words of state,Faire patch me vp his pure iambicke verse,He rauishes the gazing scoffolders Those who sate on the scaffold, a part of the play-house which answered to our upper-gallery. So again, B. iv. 2. f. 13.
When a craz'd scaffold, and a rotten stage,Was all rich Nenius his heritage.
See the conformation of our old English theater accurately investigated in the SUPPLEMENT TO SHAKESPEARE, i. 9. seq. [See supr. vol. iii. 327.].But, adds the critical satirist, that the minds of the astonished audience may not be too powerfully impressed with the terrours of tragic solemnity, a VICE, or buffoon, is suddenly and most seasonably introduced.Now lest such frightful shews of fortvne's fall,And bloody tyrant's rage, should chance appallThe dead-struck audience, mid the silent routComes leaping in a self-misformed lout,And laughs, and grins, and frames his mimic face,And jostles straight into the prince's place.—A goodlie hotch-potch, when vile russetingsAre match'd with monarchs, and with mighty kings:A goodly grace to sober tragick muse,When each base clowne his clumsy fist doth bruise In striking the benches to express applause.!
To complete these genuine and humorous anecdotes of the state of our stage in the reign of Elizabeth, I make no apology for adding the paragraph immediately following, which records the infancy of theatric criticism.Meanwhile our poets, in high parliament,Sit watching euerie word and gesturement,Like curious censors of some doutie gear,Whispering their verdict in their fellows ear.Woe to the word, whose margin in their scrole Copy.Is noted with a black condemning coal!But if each period might the synod please,Ho! bring the ivie boughs, and bands of bayes B. i. 3. f. 8..In the beginning of the next satire, he resumes this topic. He seems to have conceived a contempt for blank verse; observing that the English iambic is written with little trouble, and seems rather a spontaneous effusion, than an artificial construction.Too popular is tragick poesie,Straining his tiptoes for a farthing fee:And doth, beside, on rimeless numbers tread:Unbid iambicks flow from careless head.He next inveighs against the poet, who—in high heroic rimesCompileth worm-eat stories of old times.To these antique tales he condemns the application of the extravagant enchantments of Ariosto's ORLANDO FURIOSO, particularly of such licentious fictions as the removal of Merlin's tomb from Wales into France, or Tuscany, by the magic operations of the sorceress Melissa See ORL. FUR. iii. 10. xxvi. 39.. The ORLANDO had been just now translated by Harrington.And maketh up his hard-betaken taleWith strange inchantments, fetch'd from darksom valeOf some Melissa, who by magick doomTo Tuscans soile transporteth Merlin's tomb.But he suddenly checks his career, and retracts his thoughtless temerity in presuming to blame such themes as had been immortalised by the fairy muse of Spenser.But let no rebel satyr dare traduceTh' eternal legends of thy faerie muse,Renowned Spenser! Whom no earthly wightDares once to emulate, much less dares despight.SalustDu Bartas. of France, and Tuscan Ariost,Yield vp the lawrell garland ye haue lost B. i. 4. f. 11. In the Stanzas called a DEFIANCE to ENVY, prefixed to the Satires, he declares his reluctance and inability to write pastorals after Spenser.
At Colin's feet I throw my yielding reede.
But in some of those stanzas in which he means to ridicule the pastoral, he proves himself admirably qualified for this species of poetry.!In the fifth, he ridicules the whining ghosts of the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES, which the ungenerous and unpitying poet sends back to hell, without a penny to pay Charon for their return over the river Styx B. i. 5. f. 12..In the sixth, he laughs at the hexametrical versification of the Roman prosody, so contrary to the genius of our language, lately introduced into English poetry by Stanihurst the translator of Virgil, and patronised by Gabriel Harvey and sir Philip Sidney.Another scorns the homespun thread of rimes,Match'd with the lofty feet of elder times.Giue me the numbred verse that Virgil sung,And Virgil's selfe shall speake the English tounge.—The nimble dactyl striving to outgoThe drawling spondees, pacing it below:
The lingering spondees labouring to delayThe breathless dactyls with a sudden stay B. i. 6. f. 13, 14..His own lines on the subject are a proof that English verse wanted to borrow no graces from the Roman.The false and foolish compliments of the sonnet-writer, are the object of the seventh satire.
Be she all sooty black, or berry brown,She's white as morrow's milk, or flakes new-blown.
He judges it absurd, that the world should be troubled with the history of the smiles or frowns of a lady; as if all mankind were deeply interested in the privacies of a lover's heart, and the momentary revolutions of his hope and despair B. i. 7. f. 15..In the eighth, our author insinuates his disapprobation of sacred poetry, and the metrical versions of scripture, which were encouraged and circulated by the puritans. He glances at Robert Southwell's SAINT PETER'S COMPLAINT Wood says that this poem was written by Davies of Hereford. ATH. OXON. i. 445. But he had given it to Southwell, p. 334., in which the saint weeps pure Helicon, published this year, and the same writer's FUNERALL TEARES of the two Maries. He then, but without mentioning his name, ridicules Markham's SION'S MUSE, a translation of Solomon's Song See supr. vol. iii. p. 318.. Here, says our satirical critic, Solomon assumes the character of a modern sonnetteer; and celebrates the sacred spouse of Christ with the levities and in the language of a lover singing the praises of his mistress B. i. 8. f. 1 7..The hero of the next satire I suspect to be Robert Greene, who practiced the vices which he so freely displayed in his poems. Greene, however, died three or four years before the publication of these satires In 1593, Feb. 1, a piece is entered to Danter called Greene's Funerall. REGISTR. STATION, B. f. 304. b.. Nor is it very likely that he

should have been, as Oldys has suggested in some manuscript papers, Hall's cotemporary at Cambridge, for he was incorporated into the University of Oxford, as a Master of Arts from Cambridge, in July, under the year 1588 Registr. Univ. Oxon. sub ann.. But why should we be sollicitous to recover a name, which indecency, most probably joined with dulness, has long ago deservedly delivered to oblivion? Whoever he was, he is surely unworthy of these elegant lines.Envy, ye Muses, at your thriving mate!Cupid hath crowned a new laureate.I sawe his statue gayly tir'd in green,As if he had some second Phebus been:His statue trimm'd with the Venerean tree,And shrined fair within your sanctuary.What he, that erst to gain the rhyming goal, &c.He then proceeds, with a liberal disdain, and with an eye on the stately buildings of his university, to reprobate the Muses for this unworthy profanation of their dignity.Take this, ye Muses, this so high despight,And let all hatefull, luckless birds of night,Let screeching owles nest in your razed roofs;And let your floor with horned satyr's hoofsBe dinted and defiled euerie morn,And let your walls be an eternal scorn!His execration of the infamy of adding to the mischiefs of obscenity, by making it the subject of a book, is strongly expressed.What if some ShoreditchA part of the town notorious for brothels. fury shoud inciteSome lust-stung lecher, must he needs indite
The beastly rites of hired venery,The whole world's uniuersal bawd to be?Did neuer yet no damned libertine,Nor older heathen, nor new Florentine Peter Aretine., &c.Our poets, too frequently the children of idleness, too naturally the lovers of pleasure, began now to be men of the world, and affected to mingle in the dissipations and debaucheries of the metropolis. To support a popularity of character, not so easily attainable in the obscurities of retirement and study, they frequented taverns, became libertines and buffoons, and exhilarated the circles of the polite and the profligate. Their way of life gave the colour to their writings: and what had been the favourite topic of conversation, was sure to please, when recommended by the graces of poetry. Add to this, that poets now began to write for hire, and a rapid sale was to be obtained at the expence of the purity of the reader's mind Harrington has an Epigram on this subject. EPIGR. B. i. 40.
Poets hereaft for pensions need not care,Who call you beggars, you may call them lyars;Verses are grown svch merchantable ware,That now for Sonnets, sellers are and buyers.
And again, he says a poet was paid "two crownes a sonnet." EPIGR. B. i. 39.. The author of the RETURN FROM PARNASSUS, acted in 1606, says of Drayton a true genius, "However, he wants one true note of a poet of our times, and that is this: he cannot swagger it well in a tavern A. i. S. ii.."The first satire of the second Book properly belongs to the last. In it, our author continues his just and pointed animadversions on immodest poetry, and hints at some pernicious versions from the FACETIAE of Poggius Florentinus, and from Rabelais. The last couplet of the passage I am going to transcribe, is most elegantly expressive.But who conjur'd this bawdie Poggie's ghostFrom out the stewes of his lewde home-bred coast;
Or wicked Rablais' drunken reuellings Harvey, in his Foure Letters, 1592, mentions "the fantasticall mould of Aretine or Rabelays." p. 48. Aretine is mentioned in the last satire.,To grace the misrule of our tauernings?Or who put bayes into blind Cupid's fist,That he should crowne what laureates him list B. ii. 1. f. 25.?By tauernings, he means the encreasing fashion of frequenting taverns, which seems to have multiplied with the playhoues. As new modes of entertainment sprung up, and new places of public resort became common, the people were more often called together, and the scale of convivial life in London was enlarged. From the play-house they went to the tavern. In one of Decker's pamphlets, printed in 1609, there is a curious chapter, "How a yong Gallant should behave himself in an Ordinarie Decker's GULS HORNE BOOK, p. 22. There is an old quarto. "The Meeting of Gallants at an Ordinarie, or the Walkes of Powles," 1604. Jonson says of lieutenant Shift. EPIGR. xii.
He steales to Ordinaries, there he playesAt dice his borrowed money.—
And in CYNTHIA'S REVELLS, 1600. "You must frequent Ordinaries a month more, to initiate yourself." A. iii. S i.. One of the most expensive and elegant meetings of this kind in London is here described. It appears that the company dined so very late, as at half an hour after eleven in the morning; and that it was the fashion to ride to this polite symposium on a Spanish jennet, a servant running before with his master's cloak. After dinner, they went on horseback to the newest play. The same author in his BELMAN'S NIGHT WALKES The title page is "O per se O, or A newe Cryer of Lanthorne and candle light, &c" Lond. 1612. 4to. Bl. Lett. For J. Busbie. There is a later edition 1620. 4to., a lively description of London, almost two centuries ago, gives the following instructions.

In the second satire, he celebrates the wisdom and liberality of our ancestors, in erecting magnificent mansions for the accommodation of scholars, which yet at present have little more use than that of reproaching the rich with their comparative neglect of learning. The verses have much dignity, and are equal to the subject.To what end did our lavish auncestoursErect of old those statelie piles of ours?For thread bare-clerks, and for the ragged muse,Whom better fit some cotes of sad secluse?Blush, niggard Ago, be asham'd to seeThose monuments of wiser auncestrie!And ye, faire heapes, the Muses sacred shrines,In spight of time, and enuious repines,Stand still, and flourish till the world's last day,Vpraiding it with former loue'sOf learning. decay.What needes me care for anie bookish skill,To blot white paper with my restlesse quill:To pore on painted leaues, or beate my braineWith far-fetch'd thought: or to consvme in uaineIn latter euen, or midst of winter nights,Ill-smelling oyles, or some still-watching lights, &c.He concludes his complaint of the general disregard of the literary profession, with a spirited paraphrase of that passage of Persius, in which the philosophy of the profound Arcesilaus and of the aerumnosi Solones, is proved to be of so little use and estimation B. ii. 2. f. 28. In the last line of this satire he says,
Let swinish Grill delight in dunghill clay.
Gryllus is one of Ulysses's companions transformed into a hog by Circe, who refuses to be restored to his human shape. But perhaps the allusion is immediately to Spenser, FAIR. QU. ii. 12. 81..
In the third, he laments the lucrative injustice of the law, while ingenuous science is without emolument or reward. The exordium is a fine improvement of his original.Who doubts, the Laws fell downe from heauen's hight,Like to some gliding starre in winters night?Themis, the scribe of god, did long agoneEngrave them deepe in during marble stone:And cast them downe on this unruly clay,That men might know to rule and to obey.The interview between the anxious client and the rapacious lawyer, is drawn with much humour: and shews the authoritative superiority and the mean subordination subsisting between the two characters, at that time.The crowching client, with low-bended knee,And manie worships, and faire flatterie,Tells on his tale as smoothly as him list;But still the lawyer's eye squints on his fist:If that seem lined with a larger fee,"Doubt not the suite, the law is plaine for thee."ThoYet even. must he buy his vainer hope with price,Disclout his crownes Pull them out of his purse., and thanke him for advice B. ii. 3. f. 31.I cite a couplet from this satire to explain it.
Genus and Species long since barfoote wentUpon their tentoes in wilde wonderment, &c.
This is an allusion to an old distich, made and often quoted in the age of scholastic science.
Dat Galenus opes, dat Justinianus honores,Sed Genus et Species cogitur ire pedes.That is, the study of medicine produces riches, and jurisprudence leads to stations and offices of honour: while the professor of logic is poor, and obliged to walk on foot..The fourth displays the difficulties and discouragements of the physician. Here we learn, that the sick lady and the gouty peer were then topics of the ridicule of the satirist.The sickly ladie, and the gowtie peere,Still would I haunt, that loue their life so deere:Where life is deere, who cares for coyned drosse?That spent is counted gaine, and spared losse.He thus laughs at the quintessence of a sublimated mineral elixir.Each powdred graine ransometh captive kings,Purchaseth realmes, and life prolonged brings B. ii. 4. f. 35..Imperial oils, golden cordials, and universal panaceas, are of high antiquity: and perhaps the puffs of quackery were formerly more ostentatious than even at present, before the profession of medicine was freed from the operations of a spurious and superstitious alchemy, and when there were mystics in philosophy as well in religion. Paracelsus was the father of empericism.From the fifth we learn, that advertisements of a LIVING WANTED were affixed on one of the doors of Saint Paul's cathedral.Sawst thou ere SIQUIS SIQUIS was the first word of advertisements, often published on the doors of Saint Paul's. Decker says, "The first time that you enter into Paules, pass thorough the body of the church like a porter; yet presvme not to fetch so much as one whole turne in the middle ile, nor to cast an eye vpon SIQUIS doore, pasted and plaistered vp with seruingmens supplications, &c." THE GULS HORNE BOOKE, 1609. p. 21. And in Wroth's EPIGRAMS, 1620. EPIG. 93.
A mery Greeke set vp a SIQUIS late,To signifie a stranger come to towneWho could great noses, &c. patch'd on Paul's church dore,To gaine some vacant vicarage before?The sixth, one of the most perspicuous and easy, perhaps the most humorous, in the whole collection, and which I shall therefore give at length, exhibits the servile condition of a domestic preceptor in the family of an esquire. Several of the

satires of this second BOOK, are intended to shew the depressed state of modest and true genius, and the inattention of men of fortune to literary merit.A gentle squire would gladly entertaineInto his house some trencher-chapelaine Or, a table-chaplain. In the same sense me have trencher-knight, in LOVES LABOUR LOST.;Some willing man, that might instruct his sons,And that would stand to good conditions.First, that he lie vpon the truckle-bed,While his young maister lieth oer his head This indulgence allowed to the pupil, is the reverse of a rule antiently practiced in our universities. In the Statutes of Corpus Christi college at Oxford, given in 1516, the Scholars are ordered to sleep respectively under the beds of the Fellows, in a truckle-bed, or small bed shifted about upon wheels. "Sit unum [cubile] altius, et aliud humile et rotale, et in altiori cubet Socius, in altero semper Discipulus." Cap. xxxvii. Much the same injunction is ordered in the statutes of Magdalen college Oxford, given 1459. "Sint duo lecti principales, et duo lecti rotales, Trookyll beddys vulgariter nuncupati, &c." Cap. xlv. And in those of Trinity college Oxford, given 1556, where troccle bed, the old spelling of the word truckle bed, ascertains the etymology from trola, a wheel. Cap. xxvi. In an old Comedy THE RETURN FROM PARNASUS, acted at Cambridge in 1606, Amoretto says, "When I was in Cambridge, and lay in a trundle-bed under my tutor, &c." A. ii. Sc. vi.:Second, that he do, upon no default,Neuer presume to sit aboue the salt Towards the head of the table was placed a large and lofty piece of plate, the top of which, in a broad cavity, held the salt for the whole company. One of these stately salt-sellars is still preserved, and in use, at Winchester college. With this idea, we must understand the following passage, of a table meanly decked. B. vi. i. f. 83.
Now shalt thou never see the Salt besetWith a bid-bellied gallon flagonet.In Jonson's CYNTHIA'S REVELLS, acted in 1600, it is said of an affected coxcomb, "His fashion is, not to take knowledge of him that is beneath him in clothes. He never drinkes below the salt." A. i. S. ii.So Dekker, GULS HORNE BOOKE, p. 26. "At your twelue penny Ordinarie, you may giue any iustice of the peace, or young knight, if he sit but one degree towards the Equinoctiall of the Saltsellar, leaue to pay for the wine, &c." See more illustrations, in Reed's OLD PLAYS, edit. 1780. vol. iii. 285. In Parrot's SPRINGES FOR WOODCOCKES, 1613, a guest complains of the indignity of being degraded below the salt. Lib. ii. EPIGR. 188.And swears that he below the Salt was sett.:Third, that he neuer change his trencher twise;Fourth, that he use all common courtesies:
Sit bare at meales, and one half rie and wait:Last, that he never his yong maister beat;But he must aske his mother to defineHow manie jerks she would his breech should line.All these observ'd, he could contented be,To give five markes, and winter liverie B. ii. 6. f. 38.,From those who despised learning, he makes a transition to those who abused or degraded it by false pretences. Judicial astrology is the subject of the seventh satire. He supposes that astrology was the daughter of one of the Egyptian midwives, and that having been nursed by Superstition, she assumed the garb of Science.
That now, who pares his nailes, or libs his swine?But he must first take covnsel of the signe.
Again, of the believer in the stars, he says,His feare or hope, for plentie or for lack,Hangs all vpon his new-year's Almanack.If chance once in the spring his head should ake,It was fortold: "thus says mine Almanack."The numerous astrological tracts, particularly pieces called PROGNOSTICATIONS, published in the reign of queen Elizabeth, are a proof how strongly the people were infatuated with this sort of divination. One of the most remarkable, was a treatise written in the year 1582, by Richard Harvey, brother to Gabriel Harvey, a learned astrologer of Cambridge, predicting the portentous conjunction of the primary planets, Saturn and Jupiter, which was to happen the next year. It had the immediate effect of throwing the whole kingdom into the most violent consternation. When the fears of the people were

over, Nash published a droll account of their opinions and apprehensions while this formidable phenomenon was impending; and Elderton a ballad-maker, and Tarleton the comedian, joined in the laugh. This was the best way of confuting the impertinencies of the science of the stars. True knowledge must have been beginning to dawn, when these profound fooleries became the objects of wit and ridicule See Nash's APOLOGY OF PEERS PENNILESS, &c. Lond. 1593. 4to. f. 11..SECT. XLV.THE opening of the first satire of the third Book, which is a contrast of antient parsimony with modern luxury, is so witty, so elegant, and so poetical an enlargement of a shining passage in Juvenal, that the reader will pardon another long quotation.Time was, and that was term'd the time of gold,When world and time were young, that now are old:When quiet Saturne sway'd the mace of lead,And pride was yet unborne, and yet unbred.Time was, that whiles the autumne-fall did last,Our hungrie sires gap'd for the falling mast.Could no unhusked akorne leaue the tree,But there was challenge made whose it might be.And if some nice and liquorous appetiteDesir'd more daintie dish of rare delite,They scal'd the stored crab with clasped knee,Till they had sated their delicious ee.Or search'd the hopefull thicks of hedgy-rows,For brierie berries, hawes, or sowrer sloes:Or when they meant to fare the fin'st of all,They lick'd oake-leaues besprint with hony-fall.As for the thrise three-angled beech-nut shell,Or chesnut's armed huske, and hid kernell,Nor squire durst touch, the lawe would not afford,Kept for the court, and for the king's owne board.Their royall plate was clay, or wood, or stone,The vulgar, saue his hand, else he had none.Their onlie cellar was the neighbour brooke,None did for better care, for better looke.
Was then no 'plaining of the brewer's scape Cheats.,Nor greedie vintner mix'd the strained grape.The king's pavilion was the grassie green,Vnder safe shelter of the shadie treen.—But when, by Ceres' huswifrie and paine,Men learn'd to burie the reuiuing graine,And father Janus taught the new-found vineRise on the elme, with manie a friendly twine:And base desire bade men to deluen loweFor needlesse metalls, then gan mischief growe:Then farewell, fayrest age! &c.—He then, in the prosecution of a sort of poetical philosophy, which prefers civilized to savage life, wishes for the nakedness or the furs of our simple ancestors, in comparison of the fantastic fopperies of the exotic apparel of his own age.They, naked went, or clad in ruder hide,Or homespun russet void of foraine pride.But thou canst maske in garish gawderie,To suite a Fool's far-fetched liuerie.A Frenche head joyn'd to necke Italian,Thy thighs from Germanie, and breast from Spain:An Englishman in none, a foole in all,Many in one, and one in seuerall B. iii. 1. f. 45..One of the vanities of the age of Elizabeth was the erection of monuments, equally costly and cumbersome, charged with a waste of capricious decorations, and loaded with superfluous and disproportionate sculpture. They succeeded to the rich solemnity of the gothic shrine, which yet, amid a profusion of embellishments, preserved uniform principles of architecture.In the second satire, our author moralises on these empty memorials, which were alike allotted to illustrious or infamous characters.Some stately tombe he builds, Egyptian-wise,REX REGUM written on the pyramis:Whereas great Arthur lies in ruder oke,That neuer felt aught but the feller's stroke He alludes to the discovery of king Arthur's body in Glastonbury abbey. Lately, in digging up a barrow, or tumulus, on the downs near Dorchester, the body of a Danish chief, as it seemed, was found in the hollow trunk of a huge oak for a coffin.,Small honour can be got with gaudie graue,A rotten name from death it cannot saue.The fairer tombe, the fowler is thy name,The greater pompe procvring greater shame.Thy monument make thou thy living deeds,No other tomb than that true virtue needs!What, had he nought whereby he might be knowne,But costly pilements of some curious stone?The matter nature's, and the workman's frameHis purse's cost:—where then is Osmond's name?Deservedst thou ill? Well were thy name and thee,Wert thou inditched in great secrecie;Whereas no passengers might curse thy dust, &c B. iii. 2. f. 50..The third is the description of a citizen's feast, to which he was invited,
With hollow words, and ouerlySlight. Shallow. request.But the great profusion of the entertainment was not the effect of liberality, but a hint that no second invitation must be expected. The effort was too great to be repeated. The guest who dined at this table often, had only a single dish B. iii. 3. f. 52..The fourth is an arraignment of ostentatious piety, and of those who strove to push themselves into notice and esteem by petty pretensions. The illustrations are highly humorous.Who euer giues a paire of velvet shoesTo th' holy rood In a gallery over the screen, at entering the choir, was a large crucifix, or rood, with the images of the holy Virgin and saint John. The velvet shoes were for the feet of Christ on the cross, or of one of the attendant figures. A rich lady sometimes bequeathed her wedding-gown, with necklace and ear-rings, to dress up the Virgin Mary. This place was called the Rood-loft., or liberally allowesBut a new rope to ring the curfew bell?But he desires that his great deed may dwell,Or grauen in the chancell-window glasse,Or in the lasting tombe of plated brasse.The same affectation appeared in dress.Nor can good Myron weare on his left hond,A signet ring of Bristol-diamond;But he must cut his gloue to shew his pride,That his trim jewel might be better spied:And, that men might some burgesseSome rich citizen. him repute,With sattin sleeves hathThat is, he hath, &c. grac'd his sacke-cloth suit B. iii. 4. f. 55..The fifth is a droll portrait of the distress of a lustie courtier, or fine gentleman, whose periwinkle, or peruke, was suddenly blown off by a boisterous puff of wind while he was making his bows In a set of articles of enquiry sent to a college in Oxford, about the year 1676, by the visitor bishop Morley, the commissary is ordered diligently to remark, and report, whether any of the senior fellows wore periwigs. I will not suppose that bobwigs are here intended. But after such a proscription, who could imagine, that the bushy grizzle-wig should ever have been adopted as a badge of gravity? So arbitrary are ideas of dignity or levity in dress! There is an Epigram in Harrington, written perhaps about 1600, "Of Galla's goodly periwigge." B. i. 66. This was undoubtedly false hair. In Hayman's QUODLIBETS or Epigrams, printed 1628, there is one"to a Periwiggian." B. i. 65. p. 10. Again, "to a certaine Periwiggian." B. ii. 9. p. 21. Our author mentions a periwigg again, B. v. 2. f. 63.A golden periwigg on a blackmoor's brow..He lights, and runs and quicklie hath him spedTo ouertake his ouer-running head, &c.
These are our satirist's reflections on this disgraceful accident.Fie on all courtesie, and unruly windes,Two only foes that faire disguisement findes!Strange curse, but fit for such a fickle age,When scalpes are subject to such vassalage!—Is't not sweet pride, when men their crownes must shadeWith that which jerkes the hams of everie jade B. iii. 5. f. 57.!In the next, is the figure of a famished Gallant, or beau, which is much better drawn than in any of the comedies of those times. His hand is perpetually on the hilt of his rapier. He picks his teeth, but has dined with duke Humphry That is, he has walked all day in saint Paul's church without a dinner. In the body of old saint Paul's, was a huge and conspicuous monument of sir John Beauchamp, buried in 1358. son of Guy and brother of Thomas, earls of Warwick. This, by a vulgar mistake, was at length called the tomb of Humphry duke of Gloucester, who was really buried at Saint Alban's, where his magnificent shrine now remains. The middle ile of Saint Paul's is called the Dukes gallery, in a chapter of the GULS HORNE BOOKE, "How a gallant should behaue himself in Powles Walkes." CH. iiii. p. 17. Of the humours of this famous ambulatory, the general rendezvous of lawyers and their clients, pickpookets, cheats, buks, pimps, whores, poets, players, and many others who either for idleness or business found it convenient to frequent the most fashionable crowd in London, a more particular description may be seen, in Dekker's "DEAD TERME, or Westminsters Complaint for long Vacations and short Termes, under the chapter, Pawles Steeples complaint." SIGNAT. D. 3. Lond. for John Hodgetts, 1608. 4to. Bl. Lett.. He professes to keep a plentiful and open house for every straggling cavaliere, where the dinners are long and enlivened with music, and where many a gay youth, with a high-plumed hat, chuses to dine, much rather than to pay his shilling. He is so emaciated for want of eating, that his sword-belt hangs loose over his hip, the effect of hunger and heavy iron. Yet he is dressed in the height of the fashion,
All trapped in the new-found brauerie.
He pretends to have been at the conquest of Cales, where the nuns worked his bonnet. His hair stands upright in the

French style, with one long lock hanging low on his shoulders, which, the satirist adds, puts us in mind of a native cord, the truely English rope which he probably will one day wear.His linen collar labyrinthian set,Whose thovsand double turnings neuer met:His sleeves half-hid with elbow-pinionings,As if he meant to fly with linen wings Barnaby Rich in his IRISH HUBBUB, printed 1617, thus describes four GALLANTS coming from an Ordinary. "The third was in a yellow-starched band, that made him looke as if he had been troubled with the yellow iaundis.—They were all four in white bootes and gylt spurres, &c." Lond. 1617. 4to. p. 36..But when I looke, and cast mine eyes below,What monster meets mine eyes in human show?So slender waist, with such an abbot's loyne,Did neuer sober nature sure conjoyne!Lik'st a strawe scare-crow in the new-sowne field,Rear'd on some sticke the tender corne to shield B. iii. 7. f. 62..In the Prologue to this book, our author strives to obviate the objections of certain critics who falsely and foolishly thought his satires too perspicuous. Nothing could be more absurd, than the notion, that because Persius is obscure, therefore obscurity must be necessarily one of the qualities of satire. If Persius, under the severities of a proscriptive and sanguinary government, was often obliged to conceal his meaning, this was not the case of Hall. But the darkness and difficulties of Persius arise in great measure from his own affectation and false taste. He would have been enigmatical under the mildest government. To be unintelligible can never naturally or properly belong to any species of writing. Hall of himself is certainly obscure: yet he owes some of his obscurity to an imitation of this ideal excellence of the Roman satirists.The fourth Book breathes a stronger spirit of indignation,

and abounds with applications of Juvenal to modern manners, yet with the appearance of original and unborrowed satire.The first is miscellaneous and excursive, but the subjects often lead to an unbecoming licentiousness of language and images. In the following nervous lines, he has caught and finely heightened the force and manner of his master.Who list, excuse, when chaster dames can hireSome snout-fair stripling to their apple squire Some fair-faced stripling to be their page. Marston has this epithet, Sc. VILLAN. B. i. 3.Had I some snout-faire brats, they should indureThe newly-found Castilion calenture,Before some pedant, &c.In Satires and Epigrams, called THE LETTING OF HUMORS BLOOD IN THE HEAD-VAYNE, 1600, we have "Some pippin-squire." EPIGR. 33.,Whom staked vp, like to some stallion steed,They keep with eggs and oysters for the breed.O Lucine! barren Caia hath an heir,After her husband's dozen years despair:And now the bribed midwife sweares apace,The bastard babe doth beare his father's face.He thus enhances the value of certain novelties, by declaring them to be,
Worth little less than landing of a whale,Or Gades spoils Cadiz was newly taken., or a churl's funerale.The allusion is to Spenser's Talus in the following couplet,
Gird but the cynicke's helmet on his head,Cares he for Talus, or his flayle of leade?He adds, that the guilty person, when marked, destroys all distinction, like the cuttle-fish concealed in his own blackness.Long as the craftie cuttle lieth sure,In the blacke cloud of his thicke vomiture;
Who list, complaine of wronged faith or fame,When he may shift it to another's name.He thus describes the effect of his satire, and the enjoyment of his own success in this species of poetry.Now see I fire-flakes sparkle from his eyes,Like to a comet's tayle in th' angrie skies:His powting cheeks puft vp aboue his brow,Like a swolne toad touch'd with the spider's blow:His mouth shrinks side-ways like a scornful playse A fish. Jonson says in the SILENT WOMAN, "Of a fool, that would stand thus, with a playse-mouth, &c." A. i. S. ii. See more instances in OLD PLAYS, vol. iii. p. 395. edit. 1780.,To take his tired ear's ingrateful place.—Nowe laugh I loud, and breake my splene to see,This pleasing pastime of my poesie:Much better than a Paris-garden beare "Then led they cosin [the gull] to the gase of an enterlude, or the beare-bayting of Paris-Garden, or some other place of thieving."

Parisgarden was in the borough.,Or prating poppet on a theater,Or Mimo's whistling to his tabouret Piping or fifing to a tabour. I believe Kempe is here ridiculed.,Selling a laughter for a cold meal's meat.It is in Juvenal's style to make illustrations satirical. They are here very artfully and ingeniously introduced B. iv. 1. f. 7..The second is the character of an old country squire, who starves himself, to breed his son a lawyer and a gentleman. It appears, that the vanity or luxury of purchasing dainties at an exorbitant price began early.Let sweet-mouth'd Mercia bid what crowns she please,For half-red cherries, or greene garden pease,Or the first artichoak of all the yeare,To make so lavish cost for little cheare.When Lollio feasteth in his revelling fit,Some starved pullen scoures the rusted spit:For els how should his son maintained beAt inns of court or of the chancery, &c.The tenants wonder at their landlord's son,And blesse themThemselves. at so sudden coming on!More than who gives his pence to view some trickeOf strange Morocco's dumbe arithmeticke Bankes's horse called Morocco. See Steevens's Note, SHAKESP. ii. 292.,Or the young elephant, or two-tayl'd steere,Or the ridg'd camel, or the fiddling freere Shewes of those times. He says in this satire,
—'Gin not thy gaitUntill the evening owl, or bloody bat;Neuer untill the lamps of Paul's been light:And niggard lanterns shade the moonshine night.
The lamps about Saint Paul's, were at this time the only regular night-illuminations of London. But in an old Collection of JESTS, some Bucks coming drunk from a tavern, and reeling through the city, amused themselves in pulling down the lanterns which hung before the doors of the houses. A grave citizen unexpectedly came out and seized one of them, who said in defence, "I am only snuffing your candle." JESTS TO MAKE YOU MERIE. Written by T. D. and George Wilkins. Lond. 1607." 4to. p. 6. JEST. 17..—Fools they may feede on words, and liue on ayre The law is the only way to riches.

I believe the true reading is gelded chapel. A benefice robbed of its tythes, &c. Sayle Sale is. So in the RETURN FROM PARNASSUS, A. iii. S. 1. "He hath a proper gelded parsonage."!
He predicts, with no small sagacity, that Lollio's son's distant posterity will rack their rents to a treble proportion,
And hedge in all their neighbours common lands.Enclosures of waste lands were among the great and national grievances of our author's age Without attending to this circumstance, we miss the meaning and humour of the following lines, B. v. 1.
Pardon, ye glowing eares! Needes will it out,Though brazen walls compass'd my tongue about,As thick as wealthy Scrobio's quickset rowesIn the wide common that he did enclose.
Great part of the third satire of the same book turns on this idea.. It may be presumed, that the practice was then carried on with the most arbitrary spirit of oppression and monopoly.The third is on the pride of pedigree. The introduction is from Juvenal's eighth satire; and the substitution of the memorials of English ancestry, such as were then fashionable, in the place of Juvenal's parade of family statues without arms or ears, is remarkably happy. But the humour is half lost, unless by recollecting the Roman original, the reader perceives the unexpected parallel.Or call some old church-windowe to recordThe age of thy fair armes.—Or find some figures half obliterate,In rain-beat marble neare to the church-gate,Upon a crosse-legg'd tombe. What boots it thee,To shewe the rusted buckle that did tieThe garter of thy greatest grandsire's knee?What, to reserve their relicks many yeares,Their siluer spurs, or spils of broken speares?Or cite old Ocland's verse See supr. vol. iii. p. 314., how they did wieldThe wars in Turwin or in Turney field?Afterwards, some adventurers for raising a fortune are

introduced. One trades to Guiana for gold. This is a glance at sir Walter Rawleigh's expedition to that country. Another, with more success, seeks it in the philosopher's stone.When half his lands are spent in golden smoke,And now his second hopefull glasse is broke.But yet, if haply his third fornace hold,Devoteth all his pots and pans to gold.Some well-known classical passages are thus happily mixed, modernised, and accommodated to his general purpose.Was neuer foxe but wily cubs begets;The bear his fiercenesse to his brood besets:Nor fearfull hare falls from the lyon's seed,Nor eagle wont the tender doue to breed.Crete euer wont the cypresse sad to bear,Acheron's banks the palish popelar:The palm doth rifely rise in Jury field In Judea.,And Alpheus' waters nought but oliue yield:Asopus breeds big bullrushes alone,Meander heath; peaches by Nilus growne:An English wolfe, an Irish toad to see,Were as a chaste man nurs'd in Italy B. iv. 3. f. 26..In the fourth, these diversions of a delicate youth of fashion and refined manners are mentioned, as opposed to the rougher employments of a military life.Gallio may pull me roses ere they fall,Or in his net entrap the tennis-ball;Or tend his spar-hawke mantling in her mewe,Or yelping beagles busy heeles pursue:
Or watch a sinking corke vpon the shore Angle for fish.,Or halter finches through a privy doore A pit-fall. A trap-cage.;Or list he spend the time in sportful game, &c.He adds,Seest thou the rose-leaues fall ungathered?Then hye thee, wanton Gallio, to wed.—Hye thee, and giue the world yet one dwarfe more,Svch as it got, when thou thyself was bore.In the contrast between the martial and effeminate life, which includes a general ridicule of the foolish passion which now prevailed, of making it a part of the education of our youth to bear arms in the wars of the Netherlands, are some of Hall's most spirited and nervous verses.If Martius in boisterous buffs be drest,Branded with iron plates upon the breast,And pointed on the shoulders for the nonce With tags, or shoulder knots.,As new come from the Belgian-garrisons;What should thou need to enuy aught at that,When as thou smellest like a ciuet-cat?When as thine oyled locks smooth-platted fall,Shining like varnish'd pictures on a wall?When a plum'd fanneFans of feathers were now common.

In a couplet of this satire, he alludes to the SCHOLA SALERNITANA, an old medical system in rhyming verse, which chiesly describes the qualities of diet.
Tho neuer haue I Salerne rimes profest,To be some lady's trencher-critick guest.There is much humour in trencher-critick. Collingborn, mentioned in the beginning of this satire, is the same whose Legend is in the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES, and who was hanged for a distich on Catesby, Ratcliff, Lord Lovel, and king Richard the third, about the year 1484. See MIRR. MAG. p. 455. edit. 1610. 4to. Our author says,
Or lucklesse Collingbourne feeding of the crowes.
That is, he was food for the crows when on the gallows. At the end, is the first use I have seen, of a witty apothegmatical comparison, of a libidinous old man.
The maidens mocke, and call him withered leeke,That with a greene tayle has an hoary head..
The fifth, the most obscure of any, exhibits the extremes of prodigality and avarice, and affords the first instance I remember to have seen, of nominal initials with dashes. Yet in his POSTSCRIPT, he professes to have avoided all personal applications B. iv. 6. Collybist, here used, means a rent or tax gatherer. , nummularius..In the sixth, from Juvenal's position that every man is naturally discontented, and wishes to change his proper condition and character, he ingeniously takes occasion to expose some of the new fashions and affectations.Out from the Gades to the eastern morne,Not one but holds his native state forlorne.When comely striplings wish it were their chance,For Cenis' distaffe to exchange their lance;And weare curl'd periwigs, and chalk their face,And still are poring on their pocket-glasse;Tyr'dAttir'd.

From what follows it appears that coaches were now in common use Of the rapid encrease of the number of coaches, but more particularly of Hackney-coaches, we have a curious proof in A pleasant Dispute between Coach and Sedan, Lond. 1636. 4to. "The most eminent places for stoppage are Pawles-gate into Cheapside, Ludgate and Ludgatehill, especially when the Play is done at the Friers: then Holborne Conduit, and Holborne-Bridge, is villainously pestered with them, Hosier-Lane, Smithfield, and Cow-Lane, sending all about their new or old mended coaches. Then about the Stockes, and Poultrie, Temple-Barre, Fetter-lane, and Shoe-Lane next to Fleetstreete. But to see their multitude, either when there is a Masque at Whitehall, or a lord Mayor's Feast, or a New Play at some of the playhouses, you would admire to see them how close they stand together, like mutton-pies in a cook's oven, &c." Signat. F. Marston, in 1598, speaks of the joulting Coach of a Messalina. Sc. VILLAN. B. i. 3. And in Marston's Postscript to PIGMALION, 1598, we are to understand a coach, where he says,
—Run as sweetAs doth a tumbrell through the paved street.
In CYNTHIA'S REVELS, 1600, a spendthrift is introduced, who among other polite extravagancies, is "able to maintaine a ladie in her two carroches a day." A. iv. S. ii. However, in the old comedy of RAMALLEY, or MERRY TRICKS, first printed in 1611, a coach and a caroche seem different vehicles, A. iv. S. ii.
In horslitters, [in] coaches or caroaches.
Unless the poet means a synonime for coach.In some old account I have seen of queen Elizabeth's progress to Cambridge, in 1564, it is said, that lord Leicester went in a coach, because he had hurt his leg. In a comedy, so late as the reign of Charles the first, among many studied wonders of fictitious and hyperbolical luxury, a lover promises his lady that she shall ride in a coach to the next door. Cartwright's LOVES CONVERT. A. ii. S. vi. Lond. 1651. WORKS, p. 125.—Thou shaltTake coach to the next door, and as it wereAn Expedition not a Visit, beBound for an house not ten strides off, still carry'dAloof in indignation of the earth.Stowe says, "In the yeare 1564, Guylliam Boonen, a dutchman, became the Queene's coachmanne, and was the first that brought the vse of coaches into England. And after a while, diuers great ladies, with as great iealousie of the queene's displeasure, made them coaches, and rid in them vp and downe the countries to the great admiration of all the behoulders, but then by little and little they grew vsuall among the nobilitie, and others of sort, and within twenty yeares became a great trade of coachmaking. And about that time began long wagons to come in vse, such as now come to London, from Caunterbury, Norwich, Ipswich, Glocester, &c. with passengers and commodities. Lastly, euen at this time, 1605, began the ordinary vse of caroaches." Edit. fol. 1615. p. 867. col. 2.From a comparison of the former and latter part of the context, it will perhaps appear that Coaches and Caroaches were the same..Is't not a shame, to see each homely groomeSit perched in an idle chariot-roome?The rustic wishing to turn soldier, is pictured in these lively and poetical colours.The sturdy ploughman doth the soldier seeAll scarfed with pied colours to the knee,Whom Indian pillage hath made fortunate;And nowe he gins to loathe his former state:

Having traced various scenes of dissatisfaction, and the desultory pursuits of the world, he comes home to himself, and concludes, that real happiness is only to be found in the academic life. This was a natural conclusion from one who had experienced no other situation In this Satire, among the lying narratives of travellers, our author, with Mandeville and others, mentions the SPANISH DECADS. It is an old black-letter quarto, a translation from the Spanish into English, about 1590. In the old anonymous play of LINGUA, 1607, Mendacio says, "Sir John Mandeviles trauells, and great part of the DECADS, were of my doing." A. ii. S. i..Mongst all these stirs of discontented strife,Oh, let me lead an academick life!To know much, and to think we nothing knowe,Nothing to haue, yet think we haue enowe:In skill to want, and wanting seeke for more;In weale nor want, nor wish for greater store B. iv. 6..The last of this Book, is a satire on the pageantries of the papal chair, and the superstitious practices of popery, with which it is easy to make sport. But our author has done this, by an uncommon quickness of allusion, poignancy of ridicule, and fertility of burlesque invention. Were Juvenal to appear at Rome, he says,How his enraged ghost would stamp and stare,That Cesar's throne is turn'd to Peter's chaire:To see an old shorne lozel perched high,Crouching beneath a golden canopie!—And, for the lordly Fasces borne of old,To see two quiet crossed keyes of gold!—But that he most would gaze, and wonder at,Is, th' horned mitre, and the bloody hat Cardinal's scarlet hat.;
The crooked staffe Bishop's crosier., the coule's strange form and store And multitude of them.,Saue that he saw the same in hell before.The following ludicrous ideas are annexed to the exclusive appropriation of the eucharistic wine to the priest in the mass.The whiles the liquorous priest spits every trice,With longing for his morning sacrifice:Which he reares vp quite perpendiculare,That the mid church doth spight the chancel's fare B. iv. 7.But this sort of ridicule is improper and dangerous. It has a tendency, even without an entire parity of circumstances, to burlesque the celebration of this aweful solemnity in the reformed church. In laughing at false religion, we may sometimes hurt the true. Though the rites of the papistic eucharist are erroneous and absurd, yet great part of the ceremony, and above all the radical idea, belong also to the protestant communion.SECT. XLVI.THE argument of the first satire of the fifth Book, is the oppressive exaction of landlords, the consequence of the growing decrease of the value of money. One of these had perhaps a poor grandsire, who grew rich by availing himself of the general rapine at the dissolution of the monasteries. There is great pleasantry in one of the lines, that he
Begg'd a cast abbey in the church's wayne.In the mean time, the old patrimonial mansion is desolated; and even the parish-church unroofed and dilapidated, through the poverty of the inhabitants, and neglect or avarice of the patron.Would it not vex thee, where thy sires did keep Live, inhabit.,To see the dunged folds of dag-tayl'd sheep?And ruin'd house where holy things were said,Whose free-stone walls the thatched roofe vpbraid;Whose shrill saints-bell hangs on his lovery,While the rest are damned to the plumbery The bells were all sold, and melted down; except that for necessary use the Saints-bell, or sanctus-bell, was only suffered to remain within its lovery, that is louver, or turret, usually placed between the chancel and body of the church. Marston has "pitch-black loueries." SC. VILLAN. B. ii. 5.:Yet pure devotion lets the steeple stand,And idle battlements on either hand, &c Just to keep up the appearance of a church..
By an enumeration of real circumstances, he gives us the following lively draught of the miserable tenement, yet ample services, of a poor copyholder.Of one bay's breadth, god wot, a silly cote,Whose thatched spars are furr'd with sluttish sooteA whole inch thick, shining like black-moor's brows,Through smoke that downe the headlesse barrel blows.At his bed's feete feeden his stalled teame,His swine beneath, his pullen oer the beame.A starued tenement, such as I guesseStands straggling on the wastes of Holdernesse:Or such as shivers on a Peake hill side, &c.—Yet must he haunt his greedy landlord's hallWith often presents at each festivall:With crammed capons euerie New-yeare's morne,Or with greene cheeses when his sheepe are shorne:Or many maunds-full Maund is Basket. Hence MAUNDAYThursday, the Thursday in Passion-week, when the king with his own hands distributes a large portion of alms, &c. MAUNDAY is DIES SPORTULAE. Maund occurs again, B. iv. 2.

Certes if Pity dyed at Chaucer's date.
Chaucer places the sepulchre of PITY in the COURT OF LOVE. See COURT OF L. v. 700.

This thought is borrowed by Fenton, in his MARIAMNE., he reprehends the incongruity of splendid edifices and worthless inhabitants.Like the vaine bubble of Iberian pride,That overcroweth all the world beside The Escurial in Spain.;Which rear'd to raise the crazy monarch's fame,Striues for a court and for a college name:Yet nought within but lousy coules doth hold,Like a scabb'd cuckow in a cage of gold.—When As when.

In the RETURN FROM PARNASSUS, above quoted, a fashionable fop tells his Page, "Sirrah, boy, remember me when I come in Paul's Church-yard, to buy a Ronsard and Dubartas in French, an Aretin in Italian, and our hardest writers in Spanish, &c." A. ii. Sc. iii.,Layes siege unto the backward buyer's grot, &c.He then beautifully drawes, and with a selection of the most picturesque natural circumstances, the inhospitality or rather desertion of an old magnificent rural mansion.Beat the broad gates, a goodly hollow soundWith double echoes doth againe rebound;But not a dog doth bark to welcome thee,Nor churlish porter canst thou chafing see:All dumb and silent, like the dead of night,Or dwelling of some sleepy Sybarite!The marble pavement hid with desart weed,With house-leek, thistle, dock, and hemlock-seed.—Look to the towered chimnies, which should beThe wind-pipes of good hospitalitie:—

The satire should be like the porcupine,That shoots sharp quills out in each angry line B. v. 3..
This ingenious thought, though founded on a vulgar errour, has been copied, among other passages, by Oldham. Of a true writer of satire, he says,
He'd shoot his quills just like a porcupine,At view, and make them stab in every line APOLOGY for the foregoing ODE, &c. WORKS, vol. i. p. 97. edit. 1722. 12mo..In the fourth and last of this Book, he enumerates the extravagancies of a married spendthrift, a farmer's heir, of twenty pounds a year. He rides with two liveries, and keeps a pack of hounds.But whiles ten pound goes to his wife's new gowne,Not little less can serue to suite his owne:While one piece pays her idle waiting-man,Or buys an hood, or siluer-handled fan:
Or hires a Friezeland trotter, halfe yard deepe,To drag his tumbrell through the staring Cheape B. v. 4..The last Book consisting of one long satire only, is a sort of epilogue to the whole, and contains a humorous ironical description of the effect of his satires, and a recapitulatory view of many of the characters and foibles which he had before delineated. But the scribblers seem to have the chief share. The character of Labeo, already repeatedly mentioned, who was some cotemporary poet, a constant censurer of our author, and who from pastoral proceeded to heroic poetry, is here more distinctly represented. He was a writer who affected compound epithets, which sir Philip Sydney had imported from France, and first used in his ARCADIA We have our author's opinion of Skelton in these lines of this satire. f. 83.
Well might these checks have fitted former times,And shoulder'd angry Skelton's breathelesse rimes.. The character in many respects suits Chapman, though I do not recollect that he wrote any pastorals.That Labeo reades right, who can deny,The true straines of heroick poesy;For he can tell how fury reft his sense,And Phebus fill'd him with intelligence:He can implore the heathen deities,To guide his bold and busy enterprise:Or filch whole pages at a clap for need,From honest Petrarch, clad in English weed;While big BUT OH'S each stanza can begin,Whose trunk and taile sluttish and heartlesse been:He knowes the grace of that new eleganceWhich sweet Philisides fetch'd late from France,That well beseem'd his high-stil'd ARCADY,Though others marre it with much liberty,
In epithets to joine two words in one,Forsooth, for adjectives can't stand alone.The arts of composition must have been much practiced, and a knowledge of critical niceties widely diffused, when observations of this kind could be written. He proceeds to remark, it was now customary for every poet, before he attempted the dignity of heroic verse, to try his strength by writing pastorals Though these lines bear a general sense, yet at the same time they seem to be connected with the character of Labeo, by which they are introduced. By the Carmelite, a pastoral writer ranked with Theocritus and Virgil, he means Mantuan..But ere his Muse her weapon learn to wield,Or dance a sober PirrhickeThe Pyrrhic dance, performed in armour. in the field;—The sheepe-cote first hath beene her nursery,Where she hath worne her idle infancy;And in high startups walk'd the pastur'd plaines,To tend her tasked herd that there remains;And winded still a pipe of oate or breare, &c.Poems on petty subjects or occasions, on the death of a favourite bird or dog, seem to have been as common in our author's age, as at present. He says,Should Bandell's throstle die without a song,Or Adamans my dog be laid alongDowne in some ditch, without his exequies In pursuance of the argument, he adds,
Folly itselfe or Boldnesse may be prais'd.
An allusion to Erasmus's MORIAE ENCOMIUM, and the ENCOMIUM CALVITIEI, written at the restoration of learning. Cardan also wrote an encomium on Nero, the Gout, &c.,Or epitaphs or mournful elegies In this Satire, Tarleton is praised as a poet, who is most commonly considered only as a comedian. Meres commends him for his facility in extemporancous versification. WITS TR. f. 286.I shall here throw together a few notices of Tarleton's poetry.

Pontan here mentioned, I presume, is Jovinianus Pontanus, an elegant Latin amatorial and pastoral poet of Italy, at the revival of learning..One is surprised to recollect, that these satires are the production of a young man of twenty three. They rather seem the work of an experienced master, of long observation, of study and practice in composition.They are recited among the best performances of the kind, and with applause, by Francis Meres, a cotemporary critic,

who wrote in 1598 WIT TREAS. f. 282. It is extraordinary, that they should not have afforded any choice flowers to ENGLAND'S PARNASSUS, printed in 1600.. But whatever fame they had acquired, it soon received a check, which was never recovered. They were condemned to the flames, as licentious and immoral, by an order of bishop Bancroft in 1599. And this is obviously the chief reason why they are not named by our author, in the SPECIALITIES of his Life, written by himself after his preferment to a bishoprick SHAKING OF THE OLIVE, or his Remaining Works, 1660. 4to. Nor are they here inserted.. They were, however, admired and imitated by Oldham. And Pope, who modernised Donne, is said to have wished he had seen Hall's satires sooner. But had Pope undertaken to modernise Hall, he must have adopted, because he could not have improved, many of his lines. Hall is too finished and smooth for such an operation. Donne, though he lived so many years later, was susceptible of modern refinement, and his asperities were such as wanted and would bear the chissel.I was informed, by the late learned bishop of Glocester, that in a copy of Hall's Satires in Pope's library, the whole first satire of the sixth book was corrected in the margin, or interlined, in Pope's own hadn; and that Pope had written at the head of that satire, OPTIMA SATIRA.Milton who had a controversy with Hall, as I have observed, in a remonstrance called an APOLOGY FOR SMECTYMNUUS, published in 1641, rather unsuitably and disingenuously goes out of his way, to attack these satires, a juvenile effort of his dignified adversary, and under every consideration alien to the dispute. Milton's strictures are more sarcastic than critical; yet they deserve to be cited, more especially as they present a striking specimen of those aukward attempts at humour and raillery, which disgrace his prose-works."Lighting upon this title of TOOTHLESS SATYRS, I will not conceal ye what I thought, readers, that sure this

must be some sucking satyr, who might have done better to have used his coral, and made an end of breeding ere he took upon him to wield a satyr's whip. But when I heard him talk of scouring the shields of elvish knightsA misquoted line in the DEFIANCE TO ENVY, prefixed to the Satires. I will give the whole passage, which is a compliment to Spenser, and shews how happily Hall would have succeeded in the majestic march of the long stanza.
Or scoure the rusted swordes of Elvish knights,Bathed in pagan blood: or sheathe them newIn mistie moral types: or tell their fights,Who mighty giants, or who monsters slew:And by some strange inchanted speare and shield,Vanquish'd their foe, and won the doubtful field.May be she might, in stately stanzas frameStories of ladies, and aduenturous knights:To raise her silent and inglorious nameVnto a reachlesse pitch of praise's hight:And somewhat say, as more vnworthy done That is, have done.,Worthy of brasse, and hoary marble stone., do not blame me if I changed my thought, and concluded him some desperate cutler. But why his scornful Muse could never abide with tragick shoes her ancles for to hideB. i. 1., the pace of the verse told me, that her mawkin knuckles were never shapen to that royal buskin. And turning by chance to the sixth [seventh] Satyr of his second Book, I was confirmed: where having begun loftily in heaven's universal alphabet, he falls down to that wretched poorness and frigidity as to talk of Bridge-street in heaven, and the ostler of heavenHall supposes, that the twelve signs of the zodiac are twelve inns, in the highstreet of heaven,
—With twelve fayre signesEuer well tended by our star-divines.
Of the astrologers, who give their attendance, some are ostlers, others chamberlaines, &c. The zodiacal Sign AQUARIUS, he supposes to be in the BRIDGE-STREET of heaven. He alludes to Bridge-street at Cambridge, and the signs are of inns at Cambridge.. And there wanting other matter to catch him a heat, (for certain he was on the frozen zone miserably benummed,) with thoughts lower than any beadle's, betakes him to whip the sign-posts of Cambridge alehouses, the ordinary subject of freshmens tales, and in a strain as pitiful. Which, for him

who would be counted the FIRST ENGLISH SATYRIST, to abase himselfe to, who might have learned better among the Latin and Italian Satyrists, and in our own tongue from the VISION AND CREEDE OF PIERCE PLOWMAN, besides others before him, manifested a presumptuous undertaking with weak and unexamined shoulders. For a Satyr is as it were born out of a Tragedy, so ought to resemble his parentage, to strike high, and adventure dangerously at the most eminent vices among the greatest persons, and not to creep into every blind taphouse that fears a constable more than a satyr. But that such a poem should be TOOTHLESS, I still affirm it to be a bull, taking away the essence of that which it calls itself. For if it bite neither the persons nor the vices, how is it a satyr? And if it bite either, how is it toothless? So that TOOTHLESS SATYRS, are as much as if he had said TOOTHLESS TEETH, &c APOLOGY FOR SMECTYMNUUS, Milton's Prose-works, vol. i. p. 186. edit. Amst. 1698. fol. See also p. 185. 187. 191.."With Hall's SATIRES should be ranked his MUNDUS ALTER ET IDEM, an ingenious satirical fiction in prose, where under a pretended description of the TERRA AUSTRALIS, he forms a pleasant invective against the characteristic vices of various nations, and is remarkably severe on the church of Rome. This piece was written about the year 1600, before he had quitted the classics for the fathers, and published some years afterwards, against his consent. Under the same class should also be mentioned his CHARACTERISMES OF VERTUES, a set of sensible and lively moral essays, which contain traces of the satires WORKS ut supr. p. 171. Under the Character of the HYPOCRITE, he says, "When a rimer reads his poeme to him, he begs a copie, and perswades the presse, &c." p 187. Of the VAINEGLORIOUS. "He sweares bigge at an Ordinary, and talkes of the Court with a sharp voice.—He calls for pheasants at a common inne.—If he haue bestowed but a little summe in the glazing, pauing, parieting, of gods house, you shall find it in the church-window." [See SAT. B. iv. 3.] "His talke is, how many mourners he has furnished with gownes at his father's funerals, what exploits he did at Cales and Newport, &c." p. 194, 195. Of the BUSIE BODIE. "If he see but two men talke and reade a letter in the streete, he runnes to them and askes if he may not be partner of that secret relation: and if they deny it, he offers to tell, since he cannot heare, wonders: and then falls vpon the report of the Scottish Mine, or of the great fish taken vp at Linne, or of the freezing of the Thames, &c." p. 188. Of the SUPERSTITIOUS. "He never goes without an Erra Pater in his pocket.—Every lanterne is a ghost, and every noise is of chaines, &c." p. 189. These pieces were written after the Gunpowder-plot, for it is mentioned, p. 196..
I take the opportunity of observing here, that among Hall's prose-works are some metaphrastic versions in metre of a few of David's Psalms WORK, ut supr. p. 151. In the DEDICATION he says, "Indeed my Poetry was long sithence out of date, and yelded her place to grauer studies, &c." In his EPISTLES he speaks of this unfinished undertaking. "Many great wits haue vndertaken this task.—Among the rest, were those two rare spirits of the Sidnyes; to whom poesie was as natvrall as it is affected of others: and our worthy friend Mr. Sylvester hath shewed me how happily he hath sometimes turned from his Bartas to the sweet singer of Israel.—There is none of all my labours so open to all censures. Perhaps some think the verse harsh, whose nice eare regardeth roundnesse more than sense. I embrace smoothnesse, but affect it not." DEC. ii. Ep. v. p. 302. 303. ut supr., and three anthems or hymns written for the use of his cathedral. Hall, in his Satires, had condemned this sort of poetry.An able inquirer into the literature of this period has affirmed, that Hall's Epistles, written before the year 1613 See WORKS, ut supr. p. 275., are the first example of epistolary composition which England had seen. "Bishop Hall, he says, was not only our first satirist, but was the first who brought epistolary writing to the view of the public: which was common in that age to other parts of Europe, but not practiced in England till he published his own Epistles See Whalley's INQUIRY INTO THE LEARNING OF SHAKESPEARE, p. 41.." And Hall himself in the Dedication of his Epistles to Prince Henry observes, "Your grace shall herein perceiue a new fashion of discourse by EPISTLES, new to our language, vsuall to others: and, as nouelty is neuer without plea of vse, more free, more familiar WORKS, ut supr. p. 172. The reader of Hall's SATIRES is referred to DEC. vi. Epist. vi. p. 394.."The first of our countrymen, however, who published a set of his own Letters, though not in English, was Roger Ascham, who flourished about the time of the Reformation; and when that mode of writing had been cultivated by the best scholars in various parts of Europe, was celebrated for the terseness of

his epistolary style. I believe the second published correspondence of this kind, and in our own language, at least of any importance after Hall, will be found to be EPISTOLAE HOELIANAE, or the Letters of James Howell, a great traveller, an intimate friend of Jonson, and the first who bore the office of the royal historiographer, which discover a variety of literature, and abound with much entertaining and useful information "EPISTOLAE HOELIANAE, Familiar Letters, Domestic and Foreign, divided into sundry sections partly historical, political, and philosophical." Lond. 1645. 4to. They had five editions from 1645, to 1673, inclusive. A third and fourth volume was added to the last impression.I must not dismiss our satirist without observing, that Fuller has preserved a witty encomiastic English epigram by Hall, written at Cambridge, on Greenham's Book of the SABBATH, before the year 1592. CHURCHHISTORY, B. ix. CENT. xvi. §. vii. pag. 220. edit. 1655. fol. I find it also prefixed to Greenham's WORKS, in folio, 1601..SECT. XLVII.IN the same year, 1598, soon after the appearance of Hall's Satires, John Marston, probably educated at Cambridge, a dramatic writer who rose above mediocrity, and the friend and coadjutor of Jonson, published "The metamorphosis of Pigmalion's image. And Certaine Satyres. By John Marston. At London, printed for Edmond Matts The Colophon at the end of the book, is "At London printed by James Roberts, 1598.", and are to be sold at the signe of the hand and plough in Fleetstreete, 1598 In duodecimo. With vignettes. Pages 82. They are entered to Matts, May 27, 1598. REGISTR. STATION. C. f. 36. b. Hall's Satires are entered only the thirtieth day of March preceding.." I have nothing to do with PIGMALIONS IMAGE, one of Ovid's transformations heightened with much paraphrastic obscenity Of this piece I shall say little more, than that it is thought by some, notwithstanding the title-page just produced, not to be Marston's. But in his SCOURGE OF VILLANIE he cites it as his own. B. ii. 6. Again, B. iii. 10. And in ENGLAND'S PARNASSUS, published in 1600, part of the dedication to OPINION is quoted, with the name J. Marston, p. 221. He seems to have written it in ridicule of Shakespeare's VENUS AND ADONIS. He offers this apology, B. i. 6. (ut supr.)
—Know, I wrotThose idle rimes, to note the odious spotAnd blemish, that deformes the lineamentsOf Moderne Poesie's habiliments.Oh, that the beauties of inuentionFor want of iudgement's disposition,Should all be spoil'd! O, that such treasurie,Such straines of well-conceited poesie,Should moulded be in such a shapelesse formeThat want of art should make such wit a scorne!
The author of the Satires appears in stanzas, x. xiv. xix. I have thought that this poem suggested to Shakespeare what Lucio says in MEASURE FOR MEASURE. A. iii. S. ii. Vol. ii. p. 92. [See supr. vol. iii. 417.]. The Satires here specified are only four in number. In Charles Fitzgeoffry's AFFANIAE, a set of Latin epigrams, printed at Oxford in 1601, he is not inelegantly complimented as the second English Satirist, or rather as dividing the palm of priority and excellence in English satire with Hall.Ad JOHANNEM MARSTONIUM.Gloria Marstoni satyrarum proxima primae,Primaque, fas primas si numerare duas:Sin primam duplicare nefas, tu gloria saltemMarstoni primae proxima semper eris.Nec te poeniteat stationis, Jane: secundus,Cum duo sunt tantum, est neuter, et ambo pares Lib. ii. Sig. F. 4. In Davies's SCOURGE OF FOLLY, there is an Epigram to "The acute Mr. John Marston," on his comedy of the MALECONTENT. p. 105..In general it is not easy to give a specimen of Marston's satires, as his strongest lines are either openly vitiated with gross expression, or pervaded with a hidden vain of impure sentiment. The following humorous portrait of a sick inamorato is in his best, at least in his chastest, manner of drawing a character.For when my eares receau'd a fearfull soundThat he was sicke, I went, and there I foundHim laide of loue The midwife's phrase., and newly brought to bedOf monstrous folly, and a franticke head.His chamber hang'd about with elegies,With sad complaints of his loue's miseries:His windows strow'd with sonnets, and the glasseDrawne full of loue-knotts. I approacht the asse,And straight he weepes, and sighes some sonnet outTo his faire loue! And then he goes aboutFor to perfvme her rare perfectionWith some sweet-smelling pink-epitheton.Then with a melting looke he writhes his head,And straight in passion riseth in his bed;And hauing kist his hand, strok'd vp his haire,Made a French congè, cryes, O cruell Faire,To th' antique bed-post!—
In these lines there is great elegance of allusion, and vigour of expression. He addresses the objects of his satire, as the sons of the giants,Is Minos dead, is Rhadamanth asleepe,That thus ye dare vnto Ioue's palace creepe?What, hath Rhamnusia spent her knotted whip,That ye dare striue on Hebe's cup to sip?Yet know, Apollo's quiuer is not spent,But can abate your daring hardiment.Python is slaine, yet his accursed raceDare looke diuine Astrea in the face SAT. 5..In the same satire he calls himself,
A beadle to the world's impuritie!Marston seems to have been the poetic rival of Hall at Cambridge, whom he repeatedly censures or ridicules. In the fourth satire, he supposes Hall's criticisms on Dubartas, the versions of David's Psalms by Sternhold and king James, Southwell's MARY and SAINT PETER'S TEARS, the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES, and other pieces of equal reputation, to be the production of pedantry or malignity. And the remainder of this satire is no unpleasant parody of Hall's prefatory stanzas against envy It appears from the SCOURGE OF VILLANIE, that Hall had caused a severe Epigram to be pasted on the last page of every copy of Marston's PIGMALION'S IMAGE, that was sent from London to the booksellers of Cambridge. B. iii. 10. The Epigram is there cited. This tenth satire of the third Book was added in the second edition, in 1599. It is addressed "to his very friend maister E. G." One Edward Gilpin is cited in ENGLAND'S PARNASSUS, 1600.It appears from this Satire, that the devices on shields and banners, at tournaments, were now taken from the classics.He who upon his glorious scutchion,Can quaintly show wits newe inuention,Advancing forth some thirstie Tantalus,Or els the vulture on Prometheus,With some short motto of a dozen lines, &c.Peacham says, that of Emblems and Impresses, "the best I have seen have been the devices of tilting, whereof many were till of late reserved in the private gallery at White-Hall, of sir Philip Sydney, the earl of Cumberland, sir Henry Leigh, the earl of Essex, with many others: most of which I once collected with intent to publish them, but the charge dissuaded me." COMPL. GENT. CH. xviii. p. 277. edit. 3•. 1661. 4to..A Thrasonical captain, fresh from the siege of Cadiz, is delineated in this lively colouring.Great Tubrio's feather gallantly doth waue,Full twenty falls do make him wondrous braue!Oh golden jerkin! Royall arming coate!Like ship on sea, he on the land doth floate.——What newes from Rodio?"Hot seruice, by the lord," cries Tubrio.Why dost thou halt? "Why, six times through each thigh"Push'd with the pike of the hot enemie."Hot service, Hot!—The Spaniard is a man.—"I say no more—And as a gentleman"I serued in his face. Farwell, Adew!"Welcome from Netherland—from steaming stew Sat. i..Marston's allusions often want truth and accuracy. In describing the ruff of a beau, he says,
His ruffe did eate more time in neatest setting,Than Woodstock-worke in painfull perfecting.
The comparison of the workmanship of a laced and plaited ruff, to the laboured nicety of the steel-work of Woodstock, is just. He adds, with an appearance of wit,
It hath more doubles farre than Ajax shield.
This was no exaggeration. The shield of Ajax was only sevenfold. To say nothing of one of the leading ideas, the delicacy of contexture, which could not belong to such a shield.
But Marston is much better known as a satirist by a larger and a separate collection, yet entirely in the strain of the last, called the SCOURGE OF VILLANY, published the same year. I will give the title exactly and at length. "The SCOVRGE OF VILLANIE. Three Bookes of SATYRES. [No Name of the Author.]—Nec scombros metuentia carmina nec thus. At London, Printed by I. R. [James Roberts,] and are to be sold by John Buzbie, in Pawles churchyard, at the signe of of the Crane, 1598 In duodecimo. With vignettes. Wh. Let. The signatures run inclusively to, Sign. I 3. The title of the second edition is "THE SCOURGE OF VILLANIE. By John Marston. Nec scombros, &c. At London. Printed by I. R. Anno Dom. 1599." The tenth Satire is not in the former edition. All Marston's SATIRES, with other pieces of old poetry, were reprinted, Lond. for R. Horsfield, 1764, 12mo.." He here assumes the appellation of KINSAYDER, by which he is recognised among other cotemporary poets in the RETURN FROM PARNASSUS. In his metrical introduction, he wishes all readers of fashion would pass over his poetry, and rather examine the play-bills pasted on every post, or buy some ballad about the fairy king, and king Cophetua and the female beggar. Instead of a Muse, he invocates REPROOF, in this elegant and animated address.I inuocate no Delian deitie,Nor sacred offspring of Mnemosyne:I pray in aid of no Castalian Muse,No Nymph, no female angell, to infuseA sprightly wit to raise my flagging wings,And teach me tune these harsh discordant strings.I craue no Syrens of our halcyon-times,To grace the accents of my rough-hew'd rimes:But grim Reproofe, sterne Hate of villany,Inspire and guide a satyr's poesie!Faire Detestation of fowle odious sinne,In which our swinish times lie wallowing,
Be thou my conduct and my Genius,My wit's inticing sweet-breath'd Zephirus!Oh that a satyr's hand had force to pluckSome floodgate vp, to purge the world from muck!Would god, I could turne Alpheus' riuer in,To purge this Augean stable from fowle sinne!Well, I will try.—Awake, Impuritie!And view the vaile drawne from thy villanie B. iii. PROEM..The passage reminds us of a witty line in Young's UNIVERSAL PASSION, I know not if borrowed from hence.And cleanse the Augean stable with thy quill There is a thought like this in Dekker's GULS HORNE BOOKE, 1609, p. 4. "To pvrge [the world] will be a sorer labour, than the cleansing of Augeas' stable, or the scouring of Moore-ditch.".Part of the following nervous paragraph has been copied either by Dryden or Oldham.Who would not shake a satyr's knotty rod,When to defile the sacred name of god,Is but accounted gentlemen's disport?To snort in filth, each hower to resortTo brothell-pits: alas, a veniall crime,Nay royal, to be last in thirtieth slime B. i. 2.?In an invocation to RIME, while he is not inelegantly illustrating the pleasingness of an easy association of consonant syllables, he artfully intermixes the severities of satire.Come prettie pleasing symphonie of words,Ye well-match'd twins, whose like-tun'd tongue affords
Such musicall delight, come willingly,And daunce LevoltosAn old fashionable dance. Hanmer, on Shakespeare, defines it to be a dance in which there was much capering and turning. HEN. V. A. iii. S. v. The word implies more capering than turning. in my poesie!Come all as easie as spruce Curio will,In some court-hall to shew his capering skill:—As willingly as wenches trip around,About a may-pole, to the bagpipe's sound.——Let not my ruder handSeeme once to force you in my lines to stand:Be not so fearefull, prettie soules, to meete,As Flaccus is, the sergeant's face to greete:Be not so backward-loth to grace my sense,As Drusus is, to haue intelligence,His dad's aliue: but come into my head,As iocundly, as, when his wife was dead,Young Lelius to his home. Come, like-fac'd Rime,In tunefull number's keeping musick's time!But if you hang an arse like Tubered,When Chremes drag'd him from the brothel-bed,Then hence, base ballad-stuffe! My poesieDisclaimes you quite. For know, my libertieScornes riming lawes. Alas, poore idle sound!Since first I Phebus knew, I neuer found,Thy interest in sacred poetry:Thou to Inuention addst but surquedry Pride. False pomp.,A gaudie ornature: but hast no partIn that soule-pleasing high-infused art B. ii. AD RITHMUM..He thus wages war with his brother-bards, especially the dreamers in fairy land.Here's one must inuocate some loose-leg'd dame,Some brothel-drab, to help him stanzas frame.
Another yet dares tremblingly come out,But first he must inuoke good COLIN CLOUT Spenser as a pastoral writer..Yon's one hath yean'd a fearefull prodigy,Some monstrous and mishapen balladry An allusion to some late Ballad, with a print, of a monster, or incredible event. A Ballad-monger is a character in, "WHIMZIES, or a Newe Cast of CHARACTERS," where says the writer, "For want of truer relations, for a neede, he can finde you out a Sussex-dragon, some sea or inland monster, &c." Lond. 1631. CHA. II. p. 9. For this Sussex dragon, see the Harleian miscellany..—Another walkes, is lazie, lies him downe,Thinkes, reades: at length, some wonted slepe doth crowne,His new-falne lids, dreames: straight, ten pounds to one,Out steps some Fayery with quick motion,And tells him wonders of some flowery vale;He wakes, he rubs his eyes, and prints his tale B. ii. 6..The following line is a ridicule on the poetical language of his time, which seems rather intended for certain strains of modern poetry.Thou nursing mother of faire wisdom's lore,Ingenuous Melancholy PROEM. B. i.!—He supposes himself talking with Esop, and alludes to the story of his coming into the streets of Athens to look for a manThe introductory line, supposed to be spoken by Esop, is no unhappy parody on a well-known line in Shakespeare's RICHARD.
A Man, a Man, my kingdom for a man.. This idea introduces several ridiculous characters. Among the rest a fine lady.Peace, cynicke, see what yonder doth approach,"A cart, a tumbrell?" No, a badged coach A coach painted with a coat of arms. [See above, p. 39.].
"What's in't? Some Man." No, nor yet woman kinde,But a celestiall angel, faire refinde."The divell as soone. Her maske so hinders me,"I cannot see her beautie's deitie."Now that is off, she is so vizarded,"So steep'd in lemon-iuyce, so surphuled The word is often used by Hall and Marston. Our author supposes, that the practice came with other corruptions from Venice. CERT. SAT. 2.Didst thou to Venis goe aught els to haueBut buy a lute, and vse a curtezan?—And nowe from thence what hether dost thou bring,But SURPHULINGS, new paints and poysoning,Aretine's pictures, &c.I find the word used for a meretricious styptic lotion. "This mother baud hauing at home, a well paynted manerly harlot, as good a maid as Fletcher's mare, that bare three great foles, went in the morning to the apothecaries for halfe a pint of swete water, that commonly is called SURFULYNG water, or Clynckerdeuice, &c." From "A manifest DETECTION of the most vyle and detestable vse of DICE PLAY, &c. Imprinted at London in Paules church-yard, at the signe of the Lambe, by Abraham Vele." No date. But early in the reign of Elisabeth. Bl. Lett. 12mo. "Apothecaries would have SURPHALING water, and potatoe rootes, lie dead on their hands.—The suburbes should have a great misse of vs, and Shoreditch would complaine to dame Anne a Clear, &c."Theeves falling out, True men come by their goods.

Under one hood"Two faces: but I neuer understood,"Or sawe one face under two hoods till nowe."Away, away! Hence, coachman, go inshrine,"Thy new glaz'd puppet in port Esquiline B. ii. 7. The classical reader recollects the meaning of this allusion to the Porta Esquilina at Rome. In passing, I will illustrate a few passages in Marston's satires.Lib. iii. 11. He says,Praise but ORCHESTRA, and the skipping art.This is an allusion to sir John Davies's ORCHESTRA, a poetical dialogue between Penelope and one of her wooers, on the antiquity and excellency of Dancing, printed with his NOSCE TEIPSUM in 1599. This piece occasioned a humorous epigram from Harrington, EPIGR. B. ii. 67.A few lines afterwards Marston says,Roome for the spheres, the orbes celestiallWill daunce KEMP'S IIGGE.—Of Kemp, the original performer of Dogberry, I have spoken before.

In Kemp's NINE DAIES WONDER, printed in 1600, is the character of an innkeeper at Rockland, which could not be written by Kemp, and was most probably a contribution from his friend and fellow-player, Shakespeare. He may vie with our host of the Tabard. SIGNAT. B. 3.He was a man not ouer spare,In his eybals dwelt no care:Anon, Anon, and coming friend,Were the most words he vsde to spend:Saue, sometime he would sit and tell,What wonders once in Bullayne fell;Closing each period of his taleWith a full cup of nut-browne ale.Turwyn and Turney's siedge were hot,Yet all my hoast remembers not:Kets field, and Musseleborough fray,Were battles fought but yesterday."O, twas a goodly matter then,"To see your sword and buckler men!"They would lay here, and here and there,"But I would meet them every where, &c."By this some guest cryes ho, the house!A fresh friend hath a fresh carouse.Still will he drink, and still be dry,And quaffe with euerey company.Saint Martin send him merry matesTo enter at his hostry gates!For a blither lad than heCannot an Innkeeper be.In the same strain, is a description of a plump country lass, who officiates to Kemp in his morris-dance, as his Maid Marian.

EPIGR. cxxxiv.—or whichDid dance the famous morrisse vnto Norwich.But to return to Marston.In the Preface called▪ In lectores prorsus indignos, is the word "Proface." I do not recollect that the passage has been adduced by the late editors of Shakespeare. Vol. v. p. 595. edit. 1778.
Proface, read on, for your extreamst dislikesWill add a pinion to my praises flights.

"The table being thus furnished, instead of Grace, everie one drewe out a knife, rapt out a round oath, and cried, PROFACE, you mad rogves, &c." Signat. C. See also Taylor's SCULLER, EPIGR. 43. These instances may be added, to those which Farmer, Steevens, and Malone, have collected on the word. The meaning is obvious, "Fall on—Much good may it do you."B. i. 3.Candied potatoes are Athenians meate. Our philosophers, our academics, indulge themselves in food inciting to venery.B. i. 4.
He'll cleanse himself to Shoreditch puritie.I have before observed that Shoreditch was famous for brothels. He just before speaks of a "White friers queane. We have a Shoreditch baulke. B. iii. 11."

Note his French herring-bones.—His band-strings. Wood says, that Dr. Owen, dean of Christ church, and Cromwell's vice-chancellor at Oxford, in 1652, used to go, in contempt of form, "like a young scholar, with powdred hair, snakebone bandstrings, or bandstrings with very large tassells, lawn band, a large set of ribbands, pointed, at his knees, and Spanish-leather boots with large lawn tops, and his hat mostly cocked." ATHEN. OXON. ii. 738. Num. 572.B. ii. 7. He is speaking of a Judge, in his furred damaske-coate.He's nought but budge.—That is, fur. So Milton in COMUS, v. 707.Those budge doctors of the stoick fur. He alludes to the furred gown of a graduate. See Life of SIR T. POPE, p. 285. edit. 2.B. iii. 9. He speaks of a critic abusing Mortimer's numbers. I believe he means Drayton's epistle of MORTIMER TO QUEEN ISABEL. Drayton's EPISTLES appeared in 1597. Or perhaps Drayton's MORTIMERIADOS, published in 1596.B. iii. 11.
—Lothsome brothell-rime,That stinks like Aiax-froth, or muckpit slime.
He means sir John Harrington's Ajax, which gave great offence to queen Elizabeth. See Harrington's EPIGRAMS, B. i. 51. And Jonson, EPIGR. cxxxiv.

Her seate of sense is her rebato set.
The set of her rebato is the stiffness of her ruff newly plaited, starched, and poked. To set a hat, is to cock a hat, in provincial language. The ruff was adjusted or trimmed by what they called a poking-stick, made of iron, which was gently heated. A pamphlet is entered to W. Wright, Jul. 4. 1590, called "Blue starch and poking-stickes."

I sawe him court his mistresse lookingglasse,Worship a buske-point.—
A buske was a flexile pin or stick for keeping a woman's stays tight before. Marston's context too clearly explains the meaning of the word. So in PIGMALION'S IMAGE, st. xix.
Loue is a child contented with a toy,A buske point or some favour stills the boy.
But see OLD-PLAYS, v. 251.SATYRES, Sat. iv.
Ye Granta's white Nymphs come!—White was antiently used as a term of fondling or endearment. In the RETURN FROM PARNASSUS, 1606, Amoretto's Page says, "When he returns, I'll tell twenty admirable lies of his hawk: and then I shall be his little rogue, his WHITE villain, for a whole week after."

There are however, a few more passages which may safely be quoted, but which I choose to reserve for future illustration.There is a carelessness and laxity in Marston's versification, but there is a freedom and facility, which Hall has too frequently missed, by labouring to confine the sense to the couplet. Hall's measures are more musical, not because the music of verse consists in uniformity of pause, and regularity of cadence. Hall had a correcter ear; and his lines have a tuneful strength, in proportion as his language is more polished, his phraseology more select, and his structure more studied. Hall's meaning, among other reasons, is not always so soon apprehended, on account of his compression both in sentiment and diction. Marston is more perspicuous, as he thinks less and writes hastily. Hall is superiour in penetration, accurate conception of character, acuteness of reflection, and the accumulation of thoughts and images. Hall has more humour, Marston more acrimony. Hall often draws his materials from books and the diligent perusal of other satirists, Marston from real life. Yet Hall has a larger variety of characters. He possessed the talent of borrowing with address, and of giving originality to his copies. On the whole, Hall is more elegant, exact, and elaborate.
It is Marston's misfortune, that he can never keep clear of the impurities of the brothel. His stream of poetry, if sometimes bright and unpolluted, almost always betrays a muddy bottom. The satirist who too freely indulges himself in the display of that licentiousness which he means to proscribe, absolutely defeats his own design. He inflames those passions which he professes to suppress, gratifies the depravations of a prurient curiosity, and seduces innocent minds to an acquaintance with ideas which they might never have known.The satires of Hall and Marston were condemned to the same flame and by the same authority. But Hall certainly deserved a milder sentence. Hall exposes vice, not in the wantonness of description, but with the reserve of a cautious yet lively moralist. Perhaps every censurer of obscenity does some harm, by turning the attention to an immodest object. But this effect is to be counteracted by the force and propriety of his reproof, by shewing the pernicious consequences of voluptuous excesses, by suggesting motives to an opposite conduct, and by making the picture disgustful by dashes of deformity. When Vice is led forth to be sacrificed at the shrine of virtue, the victim should not be too richly dressed.SECT. XLVIII.THE popularity of Hall's and Marston's Satires, notwithstanding their proscription or rather extermination by spiritual authority, produced an innumerable crop of SATIRISTS, and of a set of writers, differing but little more than in name, and now properly belonging to the same species, EPIGRAMMATISTS.In 1598, printed at London, appeared "SKIALETHEIA, or a Shadowe of Truth in certaine Epigrams and Satyres." The same year, SEUEN SATIRES, applied to the week, including the world's ridiculous follies Entered to William Fyrebrand, May 3, 1598. REGISTR. STATION. C. f. 34. b.. This form was an imitation of the SEMAINES of Du Bartas, just translated into English by Delisle. The same year, "A SHADOWE of TRUTH in certaine Epigrams and Satires. Entered to N. Linge, Sept. 15, 1598. Ibid. f. 41. b.." This year also, as I conjecture, were published Epigrams by sir John Davies, author of NOSCE TEIPSUM Marlowe's OVID'S ELEGIES were accompanied with these Epigrams. The whole title is, "Epigrammes and Elegies, by J. D. and C. M. [Marlowe.] at Middleburgh." No date. Davies's Epigrams are commended in Jonson's Epigrams, xviii. And in Fitzgeoffry's AFFANIAE, Lib. ii. Signat E. 4.
DAVISIOS laedat mihi, Jonsoniosque lacessat.. These must not be confounded with the SCOURGE OF FOLLY, by John Davies of Hereford, printed in 1611. In 1598 also, was published in quarto, "Tyros roaring Megge, planted against the walls of Melancholy, London, 1598." With two Decads of Epigrams With "sequitur Tyronis Epistola." Compare Wood, ATH. OXON, F. i. 219.. The author appears to have been of Cambridge. Tyro is perhaps a real name. The dedication is to Master John Lucas.
In the year 1598, was also published, under the general title of CHRESTOLOROS, seven Books of Epigrams, by Thomas Bastard Entered to Joane Brome, Apr. 3, 1598. Ibid. f. 38. b.. Bastard, a native of Blandford in Dorsetshire, was removed from a fellowship of New-College Oxford, in 1591, being, as Wood says, "much guilty of the vices belonging to the poets, "and given to libelling ATH. OXON. i. 431.." Harrington, the translator of Ariosto, has an Epigram addressed to "Master Bastard, a minister, that made a pleasant Booke of English Epigrams HARRINGTON'S EPIGRAMS, B. ii. 64. See also B. ii. 84. They are also mentioned with applause in Goddard's MASTIF, no date, SAT. 81. And in Parrot's SPRINGES FOR WOODCOCKES, Lib. i. EPIGR. 118.." Wood, in his manuscript Collection of Oxford libels and lampoons, which perhaps he took as much pleasure in collecting as the authors in writing, now remaining in the Ashmolean Museum, and composed by various students of Oxford in the reign of queen Elizabeth, has preserved two of Bastard's satyrical pieces One of them is entitled, "An admonition to the City of Oxford, or Mareplate's Bastardine." In this piece, says Wood, he "reflects upon all persons of note in Oxford, who were guilty of amorous exploits, or that mixed themselves with other men's wives, or with wanton houswives in Oxon." The other is a disavowal of this lampoon, written after his expulsion, and beginning Jenkin, why man, &c. See Meres, WITS TR. f. 284.. By the patronage or favour of lord treasurer Suffolk, he was made vicar of Bere-regis, and rector of Hamer, in Dorsetshire; and from writing smart epigrams in his youth, became in his graver years a quaint preacher There are two sets of his Sermons, Five, London, 1615, 4to. The three first of these are called the MARIGOLD OF THE SUN. Twelve, London, 1615. 4to.. He died a prisoner for debt, in Dorchester-gaol, April 19, 1618. He was an elegant classic scholar, and appears to have been better qualified for that species of the occasional pointed Latin epigram established by his fellow-collegian John Owen, than for any sort of English versification.In 1599, appeared "MICROCYNICON sixe snarling satyres by T. M. Gentleman," perhaps Thomas Middleton. About the same time appeared, without date, in quarto, written by

William Goddard, "A MASTIF WHELP, with other ruff-iland-like currs fetcht from amongst the Antipedes, which bite and barke at the fantastical humourists and abusers of the time. Imprinted at the Antipedes, and are to be bought where they are to be sold." It contains eighty-five satires. To these is added, "Dogges from the Antipedes," containing forty one The name of the author, who appears to have been a soldier, is added in the Dedication, to some of his flatt-cappe friends at the Temple. The Satires were written after Bastard's EPIGRAMS, which are commended, SAT. 81. I will give a specimen from the second part, SAT. 5.To see Morilla in her coach to ride,With her long locke of haire vpon one side;With hatt and feather worn in swaggring gvise,With buttned boddice, skirted dubblettwise,Vnmaskt, and sit i' th' booth without a fanne:Speake, could you iudge her lesse than be some manne, &c.Here is the dress of a modern amazon, in what is called a Riding-habit. The sidelock of hair, which was common both to men and women, was called the French Lock. So Freeman of a beau, in RUB AND A GREAT CAST, edit. 1614, EPIGR. 32.Beside a long French locke.—And Hall, SAT. iii. 7.His haire French-like stares on his frighted head,One locke, amazon-like, disheveled.Hence may be illustrated a passage in a Letting of Humours blood, &c. printed about 1600. EPIGR. 27.

See also Perrott's Springes for Woodcockes, or Epigrams, 1613, Lib. i. EPIGR. i. Of a beau.
And on his shoulder weares a dangling locke.
In B. Rich's OPINION DEIFIED, &c. "Some by wearing a long locke that hangs dangling by his eare, do think by that louzie commoditie to be esteemed by the opinion of foolery." Lond. 1613. 4to. ch. xxix. p. 53. Again, in RETURN FROM PARNASSUS, 1606, A. iii. S. ii.
Must take tobacco, and must weare a lock.
Compare Warburton's note on MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, A. v. S. i. "He wears a key in his ear, and a long lock hanging by it, &c." I add but one more instance, from the character of a RUFFIAN, or bully. "When without money, his gingling spurre hath last his voyce, his head his locke, &c." WHIMZIES, or a new Cast of CHARACTERS, Lond. 1631. 16mo. p. 136..A satyrical piece in stanzas, which has considerable merit, called PASQUILL'S MAD-CAP, was printed at London in quarto, for V. S. in the year 1600 He says, p. 36.
And tell prose writers, STORIES are so stale,That penie ballads make a better sale.
He mentions country-players, p. 31. PASQUILL'S MAD-CAP is applauded in THE WHIPPINGE OF THE SATYRE, 1601. Signat. F. 3.
That MAD-CAP yet superiour praise doth win, &c.
In Dekker's GUL'S HORNE BOOK, 1609, we have, "I am the Pasquill's MAD-CAPPE that will doot." p. 8. "PASQUILL'S IESTS, with the merriments of mother Bunch," were published, Lond. 1629. Bl. Let. 4to. But this I suppose not to have been the first edition. And in reference to Pasquill's MAD-CAP, there is, "Old Mad-cappes new gallimaufry, made into a merrie messe of mingle mangle, 1602.". With Pasquill's MESSAGE.

Also by the same author, perhaps Nicholas Breton, Pasquill's FOOLE-CAP, printed for T. Johnes in the same year, the dedication signed, N. B. At the end is "Pasquill's passion for the world's waiwardnesse Under the title of PASQUIN, we have also the following coeval pieces. "PASQUILL'S MISTRESSE, or the worthie and unworthie woman, 1600.—PASQUILL'S PASSE, and passeth not, set downe in three pees, 1600.—PASQUILL'S PALINODIA, and his Progresse to the taverne, where, after the survey of the Sellar, you are presented with a pleasant pynte of poeticall sherry, 1619."." In the year 1601, was published in duodecimo, "The whipper of the Satyre, his pennance in a white sheete, Or the Beadles Confutation, Imprinted at London, by John Fasket, 1601." And by way of reply, "No whippinge nor trippinge, but a kind of snippinge, London, 1601." Again, "The whipping of the SATYRE, Imprinted at London for John Flasket, 1601 In duodecimo. It is dedicated to the "Vayne glorious, the HUMOURIST, SATYRIST, and EPIGRAMMATIST." The writer's initials are I. W. I believe this piece to be a Reply to Rowlands. But in one place he seems to attack Marston. Signat. D 2.

He mentions the Fatness of Falstaff. Signat. D 3.
That sir John Falstaffe was not any wayMore grosse in body, than you are in brayne.." About the same time, as I conjecture, were published, "Epigrams served out in fifty-two severall dishes, for every man to taste without surfeting. By I. C. gentleman." At London, without date. In 1608, "Epigrams, or Humour's Lottery Entered, April 11, to Busbie and Holme. REGISTR. STATION. C. f. 165. b.." The same year, "A Century of Epigrams, by R. W. Bachelor of Arts, Oxon Entered, Apr. 21, to T. Thorpe, Ib. f. 166. a. I take R. W. to be Richard West, who is the author of "Newes from Bartholomew fair," entered to I. Wright, Jul. 16, 1606.

In 1617, "A paraphrasticke transcript of Juvenal's tenth Satyre, with the tragicall narrative of Virginia's death is entered, Oct. 14, to N. Newbury." REGISTR. C. f. 284. b.." In 1613, were published two books of epigrams, written by Henry Perrot, entitled, "LAQUEI RIDICULOSI, or Springes for Woodcockes. Caveat emptor. Lond. for J. Busbie, 1613 In the Latin Dedication, it appears they were written in 1611. Mr. Steevens quotes an edition in 1606. Shakesp. Vol. viii. 409.." Many of them are worthy to be revived in modern collections. I am tempted to transcribe a specimen.A Welshman and an Englishman disputed,Which of their LandsCountries. maintain'd the greatest state:The Englishman the Welshman quite confuted;Yet would the Welshman nought his brags abate;"Ten cookes in Wales, quoth he, one wedding sees;"True, quoth the other,—Each man toasts his cheeseLib. i. EPIGR. 9.Taylor the water poet, has mentioned Parrot's Epigrams, in EPIGRAMS, p. 263. fol. edit. EPIGR. vii.
My Muse hath vow'd reuenge shall haue her swindge,To catch a Parrot in the woodcockes springe.
See also p. 265. EPIGR. xxxi.."John Weaver, I believe the antiquary who wrote ANTIENT FUNERAL MONUMENTS, published a book of Epigrams, in 1599, or rather 1600, which are ranked among the best, by Jonson Jonson's EPIGR. xviii. They are in duodecimo, and cited in ENGLAND'S PARNASSUS, 1600.. Thomas Freeman, a student in Magdalen college Oxford, about the year 1607, who appears to have enjoyed the friendship and encouragement of Owen, Shakespeare, Daniel, Donne, Chapman, and Heywood the dramatist, printed in quarto, "RUB AND A GREAT CAST. In one hundred Epigrams, London, 1614 I am tempted to give the following specimen of our author's humour, more especially as it displays the growing extent of London, in the year 1614. Sign. B. 3. EPIGR. 13.
LONDON'S PROGRESSE.Quo ruis, ab demens?—Why how nowe, Babell, whither wilt thou build?I see old Holborne, Charing-crosse, the Strand,Are going to Saint Giles's in the field.Saint Katerne she takes Wapping by the hand,And Hogsdon will to Hygate ere't be long.London is got a great way from the streame,I thinke she meanes to go to Islington,To eate a dishe of strawberries and creame.The City's sure in progresse I surmise,Or going to revell it in some disorder,Without the walls, without the Liberties,Where she neede feare nor Mayor nor Recorder.Well, say she do, 'twere pretty, yet tis pitty,A Middlesex Bailiff should arrest the Citty.
This poetical rant has been verified far beyond the writer's imagination.." To these is annexed, "RUB AND

A GREAT CAST. The second Bowl in an hundred Epigrams." Both sets are dedicated to Thomas Lord, Windsor. Thomas Wroth of Glocester-Hall, Oxford, about 1603, published at London, in quarto, 1620, "An Abortive of an idle Hour, or a century of Epigrams They are mentioned with applause in Stradling's EPIGRAMMATA, published 1607.."To the opening of 1600, I would also assign "The MASTIVE or young Whelpe of the old dogge. Epigrams and Satyres. London, printed by Thomas Creede. In quarto, without date." The Advertisement to the reader is subscribed H. P I know not if these initials mean Henry Parrot, an epigrammatist before recited. There is also, "THE MORE THE MERRIER, containing threescore and odde headlesse Epigrams shott, like the Fools bolt amongst you, light where you will. By H. P. Gent." Lond. 1608. 4to. "Who says in his dedication, Concerning vnsauorie lewdnesse, which many of our Epigrammatist so much affect, I haue esteemed it fitter for Pick-hatch than Powles churchyard." Is H. P. for Henry Peacham? One of the Epigrams (Epig. 51.) in the last mentioned collection appears, with some little difference only, in Peacham's MINERVA, fol. 61. edit. 4to. By one H. P. are "Characters and Cures for the Itch. Characters, Epigrams, Epitaphs." A BALLAD-MAKER is one of the characters, p. 3. London, for T. Jones, 1626. 12mo.. We are sure that they were at least written after Churchyard's death: for in the third Epigram, the writer says, that Haywood was held for EPIGRAMS the best when Churchyard wrote I have some faint remembrance of a collection of Epigrams, by Thomas Harman, about the year 1599. Perhaps he is the same who wrote the following very curious tract, unmentioned by Ames. "A Caueat for common vrsitors uulgariter, called Uagabondes, set forth by Thomas Harman, esqvier, for the vtilitie and proffyt of his naturall countrey. Newly augmented and imprinted Anno domini. M. D. LXVII. Imprinted at London in fletestrete, at the signe of the faulcon, by Wylliam Gryffith, and are to be solde at his shoope, in saynt Dunstones churchyard, in the west." A quarto in black letter, with a wooden cut in the title. In the work, is a reference to the first edition in the preceding year, 1566. It is dedicated, with singular impropriety, to Elizabeth countess of Shrewsbury. The writer speaks of his lodgings "at the White fryers within the cloyster." fol. 20. b. This seems to have given rise to another piece of the same sort, unnoticed also by Ames, "The fraternitye of vacabondes, as wel of ruflyng vacabondes, as of beggerly, as women as of men, of gyrles as of boyes, &c. Wherevnto also is adioyned the xxv order of Knaues, &c. Imprinted at London, by Iohn Awdely, dwellyng in little Britayne streete, without Aldersgate, 1575." Bl. Let. 4to. These, by the way, are some of the first books exhibiting, not only the tricks but the language, of thieves, which Jonson has introduced into his MASQUE OF GIPSIES. Compare Ames, HIST. PR. p. 423..
Some of the critics of the author's days are thus described.The mending poet takes it next in hand;Who hauing oft the verses ouerscan'd,"O filching!" straight doth to the stat'ner say,"Here's foure lines stolen from my last newe play."—Then comes my Innes of court-man in his gowne,Cryes, Mew!

SAT. ii. SIGNAT. H. 3.."In these days, the young students of the Inns of Court, seem to have been the most formidable of the critics Hence, among a variety of instances, says Marston in the second preface to his SCOURGE OF VILLANY.
Some pedant spruce, or some span-new-come fry,Of Inns a-court, striuing to vilefieMy darke reproofes, &c..The figure and stratagems of the hungry captain, fresh from abroad, are thus exposed.Marke, and you love me.—Who's yond' marching hither?Some braue Low-Countrey Captain with his feather,And high-crown'd hat.

SIGNAT. I. 2..The wars in Spain and the Low-countries filled the metropolis with a set of needy military adventurers, returning from those expeditions, who were a mixture of swaggering and submission, of flattery and ferocity, of cowardice and courage, who assumed a sort of professional magnanimity, yet stooped to the most ignominious insults, who endeavoured to attract the attention of the public, by the splendour of martial habiliments, were ready for any adventures of riot and debauchery, and insinuated themselves into favour by hyperbolical narrations of their hazardous atchievements. Jonson's Bobadill was of this race of heroic rakes. We have seen one of them admirably described by Marston And in another place, B. ii. 7.What, meanst thou him, that in his swaggering slopsWallowes vnbraced all along the streete?He that salvtes each gallant he doth meete,With farewell capitaine, kind heart, adew!He that the last night, tumbling thou didst view,From out the great man's head A sign., and thinking still,He had been sentinell of warlike Brill, &c.The great man's head, if the true reading, must be a cant word for the Sign of some tavern. Harrington has an Epigram of one getting drunk at the Sarazens head. B. i. 52. W. Fenner mentions the Saracen's head, without Newgate, and another without Bishopsgate, both famous for ferocity of feature. The Compter's Commonwealth, &c. p. 3. Lond. 1617. 4to. Brill, which we now call The Brill, is a town in the Netherlands. See also Hall, SAT. iv. 4.
And pointed on the shoulders for the nonce,As new come from the Belgian garrisons..
In 1600 appeared, a mixture of Satires and Epigrams, "THE LETTING OF HUMOURS BLOOD IN THE HEAD VAINE, with a new morisco daunced by seauen satyrs, upon the bottom of Diogenes tubbe," written by Samuel Rowlands, and printed by William White In small octavo. There is another edition, without date, in small quarto, exhibiting a very different title, "HUMORS ORDINARIE, where a man may be verie marrie, and exceedingly well vsed for his six-pence. At London, Printed for William Firebrand, &c." I know not which is the first of the two. He praises Tarleton the comedian, for his part of the Clowne, and his Clownishe oppe, EPIGR. 30. And Pope for his part of the Clowne. SAT. iv. Singer the player is also mentioned. ibid. One Samuel Rowlands, I know not if the same, has left in verse, "The Betraying of Christ, Judas in despair, The seven wounds of our Saviour on the crosse, with other poems on the passion," dedicated to sir Nicholas Walsh, knight, 1598, for Adam Islip, in quarto. Under the same name I have seen other religious poems, rather later. See Percy's BALL. iii. 117..In a panegyric on Charnico, a potation mentioned by Shakespeare, he alludes to the unfortunate death of three cotemporary poets, two of which are perhaps Green and Marlowe, or perhaps George Peele It is called a sparkling liquor, in Goddard's MASTIF-WHELP, or Satires, no date. SAT. 63. [See Notes to SE. P. HENR. vi. A. ii. S. 3.]

Again, EPIGR. 22. Marlow's end has been before related. Robert Green was killed by a surfeit of pickled herrings and Rhenish wine. This was in 1592. At which fatal banquet Thomas Nash was present. Meres says, that Peele died of the venereal disease. WITS TR. f. 285. p. 2. He must have been dead before, or in, 1598.!
The rotation of fashionable pleasures, and the mode of passing a day of polite dissipation in the metropolis, are thus represented. The speaker is SIR REVELL, who is elegantly dressed in a dish-crowned hat and square-toed shoes.Speake, gentlemen, what shall we do to day?Drinke some braue health vpon the Dutch carouse Marston asks, what a traveller brings from Holland, CERT.

This fashion-monger, each morne fore he rise,Contemplates sute-shapes, and once out of bed,He hath them straight full lively portrayed:And then he chuckes, and is as proude of this,As Taphus when he got his neighbours blisse.All fashions, since the first yeare of the Queene,May in his study fairly drawne be scene;—The long Fooles coat, the huge slop, the lug'd boote,From mimick Pyso all doe claime their roote.O, that the boundlesse power of the souleShould be coup'd vp in fashioning some roule!

He scornes to walke in Powles without his bootes.!One of the swaggerers of the times, who in his rambles about the town, visits the Royal Exchange as a mercantile traveller, is not unluckily delineated.Sometimes into the Royal 'Change he'll droppe,Clad in the ruines of a broker's shoppe.And there his tongue runs byass on affaires,No talk, but of commodities and wares.—If newes be harken'd for, then he prevalyes,Setting his mynt at worke to coyne new tayles Hall has a character partly resembling this, SAT. vi. 1.

I have "THE SPANISH MANDEVILE OF MIRACLES, translated from the Spanish," Lond. 1618. 4to. The Dedication, to lord Buckhurst, is dated 1600..Men without heads, and pigmies hand breadth hie,Those, with no legges, that on their backs do lie;Or Or those, who having legs, and lying on their backs, &c., do the weather's iniurie sustaine,Making their leggs a penthouse for the raine SAT. i. In these Satires, Monsieur Domingo, a drunkard is mentioned. EPIGR. i. See Shakesp. SEC. P. H. iv. A. 5. S. 3..Gabriel Harvey, in his Four Letters printed in 1592, quotes some English hexameters, from "those vnsatyrical Satyres, which Mr. Spencer long since embraced in an overloving sonnet LET. iii. p. 44.." This passage seems to indicate a set of satires, now unknown, to which Spenser had prefixed the undeserved honour of a recommendatory sonnet, now equally forgotten.Meres, who wrote in 1598, observes, "As Horace, Lucilius, Juvenal, Persius, and Lucullus, are the best for SATYRE among the Latins, so with us, in the same faculty these are chiefe: Piers PLOWMAN, Lodge, Hall of Emanuel colledge in Cambridge, the author of PIGMALION'S IMAGE AND CERTAINE SATYRES Marston's SCOURGE OF VILLANIE had not yet appeared., the author of SHIALETHIA Fol. 282. 2.." And in another place, having cited some of Marston's satires, he adds Rankins as a satirist Fol. 277.. I have never elsewhere seen the name of Rankins. Nor have I seen Lodge's Satires, unless his

"ALARUM AGAINST USURERS, containing tried experiences against worldly abuses," and its appendix his History of Forbonius and Prisaeria, printed at London, in 1584, may be considered under that character.Wood also, a great dealer in the works of our old minor poets, yet at the same time a frequent transcriber from Meres, still more embarrasses this matter, where he says, that Lodge, after he left Trinity college at Oxford, about the year 1576, and "had spent some time in exercising his fancy among the poets in the great city, he was esteemed, not Joseph Hall of Emanuel college excepted, the best for satyr among English men ATH. OXON. i. 498.." Lodge was fitted for a different mode of composition. He was chiefly noted for pastorals, madrigals, and sonnets; and for his EUPHUES GOLDEN LEGACY, which furnished the plot of the AS YOU LIKE IT of Shakespeare. In an extended acceptation, many of the prose-pamphlets written about this period, by Greene and Decker, which paint or expose popular foibles and fashions, particularly Decker's GUL'S HORN-BOOK, a manual or directory for initiating an unexperienced spendthrift into the gaieties of the metropolis, might claim the appellation of satires Harrrington in his Epigrams, mentions the Satires of a poet whom he often attacks under the name of Lynus. B. i. 67.
His Distickes, SATYRES, Sonnets and Hexameters,His Epigrams, his Lyricks, and Pentameters.
And again, he has an Epigram "Against a foolish Satyrist, called Lynus." B. i. 14. See also, B. i. 41.. That the rage of writing satires, and satirical epigrams, continued long, will appear from a piece of some humour, called "An Inquisition against Paper-persecutors," written in 1625 By A. H. Lond. for H. H. 1625. p. 1. At the end of "A Scourge for Paperpersecutors, by I. D."And shall it still be so? Nor is't more hardTo repaire Paul's, than to mend Paul's church-yard?Still shall the youths that walk the middle ile,To whet their stomacks before meales, compileTheir sudden volumes, and be neuer barr'dFrom scattering their bastards through the yard?——It is no wonder,That Paul's so often hath beene strucke with thunder;Twas aimed at those shops, in which there lieSuch a confvsed heape of trumperie,Whose titles each terme on the posts are rear'd,In such abundance, it is to be fear'dThat they in time, if thus they go on, willNot only LITTLE but GREAT Britain fill,With their infectious swarmes, whose guilty sheetesI haue obserued walking in the streetes;Still lurking neare some church, as if herebyThey had retired to a sanctuary,For murdering paper so.——Each drincking lozell nowe,That hath but seen a colledge, and knows howe, &c.After having censured those who versified the bible, and made it all Apocryphal, but with a compliment to the translators of Du Bartas, he adds,Others that nere search'd newe-born vice at all,But the Seuen Deadly Sinnes in generall,Drawne from the tractate of some cloyster'd frier,Will needs write SATYRES, and in raging fireExasperate their sharpe poeticke straine;And thinke they haue touch'd it, if they raile at Spaine,The pope, and devill.—The reader will recollect, that Saint Paul's church-yard and its environs, in which was LITTLE-BRITAIN, abounded with shops and stalls of booksellers: that its steeple was thrown down by lightening, in 1561: and that a general reparation of the church was now become a great object of the nation.. But of this, more distinct proofs will appear in the progress of our history.
It must not be forgotten, that a second impression of an English version of Ariosto's Satires, which contain many anecdotes of his life and circumstances, and some humourous tales, and which are marked with a strong vein of free reprehension, but with much less obscenity than might be expected from satires written by the author of ORLANDO FURIOSO, appeared in long verse, by an anonymous translator, in 1611 "Ariosto's SEVEN PLANETS gouerning Italie. Or, his Satyrs in seuen famous discourses, &c. Newly corrected and augmented, &c. With a new edition of three most excellent ELEGIES, written by the same Lodovico Ariosto." By W. Stanby, 1611. 4to. I believe this title gave rise to the following. "A Booke of the seuen planets, or seuen wandring motions of William Alablaster's wit, retrograded or removed by John Raster." Lond. 1598. 4to. There is an edition of this translation of Ariosto's Satires, 1608. See supr. vol. iii. 481.It is more certain that Ariosto's title gave rise to "The Philosophers Satyrs, or the Philosophers Seven Satyrs, alluding to the seuen Planets, &c." By Robert Anton of Magdalene college, Cambridge. Lond. 1616. 4to. It may be sufficient to have mentioned these Satires here.. I believe these satires are but little known or esteemed by the Italians.
For the sake of juxtaposition, I will here anticipate in throwing together the titles of some others of the most remarkable collections of satires and satirical epigrams, published between 1600 and 1620, meaning to consider hereafter those that best deserve, more critically and distinctly I have seen "N. Britland's BOURE OF DELIGHT, Contayning Epigrams, Pastorals, Sonnets, &c." Printed for W. Jones 1597. But these Epigrams do not so properly belong to the class before us. The same may be said of the Epigrams of George Turberville, and some few others.. The COURT OF CONSCIENCE, or Dick Whipper's Sessions, appeared in 1607. More fooles yet, a collection of Epigrams in quarto, by R. S. perhaps Richard Smith, in 1610. The most elegant and wittie Epigrams of sir James Harrington, the translator of Ariosto, in four books, in 1611 Many of Harrington's Epigrams were certainly written before. Perhaps there was an older edition. In Fitzgeoffrey's Latin Epigrams, called AFFANIAE, published 1601, there is an Epigram to Harrington, with these lines preferring him to Haywood or Davies, as an English epigrammatist. Signat. B. 3.
Sive arguta vago flectas epigrammata torno,Sive Britanna magis sive Latina velis.At tu Biblidicis malis comes ire Camenis,Illis HAYWOODOS DAVISIOSQUE praeis.
And in sir John Stradling's Epigrams, published 1607, there is one to Harrington with this title, Lib. i. p. 32. "Ad D. I. Harrington, Equitem doctissimum, de quibusdam epigrammatis Stradlingo, equiti, dono missis, 1590." And in Stradling's epigrams, we have two of Harrington's translated into Latin.. Jonson's EPIGRAMS, in 1616 Jonson's epigrams, as we have seen, are mentioned with Davies's, by Fitzgeoffrey, 1601. AFFAN. Lib. ii. Signat. E. 4.
DAVISIOS laedis mihi, JONSONIOSQUE lacessis.Of this the first Davies, Harrington says, "This Haywood [the epigrammatist] for his prouerbs and epigrams is not yet put down by any of our country, though one [Davies in the margin] doth indeede come neare him, that graces him the more in saying he put him downe, &c."—"A NEW DISCOVRSE of a stale svbiect, called the METAMORPHOSIS of AJAX, &c." Printed 1596. 12mo. SIGNAT. D. 2. Again, "But as my good friend M. Dauies saide of his Epigrams, that they were made like doublets in Birchen-lane, for euery one whom they will serue, &c." Ibid.

Henry Fitzgeoffry's SATIRES in 1617 In Hayman's QUODLIBETS, or Epigrams, there is one, "To the reverend, learned, and acute, Master Charles FitzGeoffrey, bachelor in diuinity, my especiall kind friend, and most excellent poet." He compares him to Homer, being blind of one eye. B. i. 111. p. 18. This was Charles the author of the Latin Epigrams, abovementioned..

Certaine Pieces of this age parabolized, by the same, in 1616 Lond. Printed by E. Griffin, for F. Constable, &c. 8vo. I suppose these two last to be second editions.. George Wither, of Manydowne in Hamshire, educated at Magdalene College, in Oxford, and at Lincolns inn, afterwards an officer in Cromwell's army, and popular even among the puritans as a poet, published ABUSES stript and whipt, or Satyricall Essayes. Divided into two Bookes. in 1613 Three editions soon followed, 1614, 1615, 1622, 8vo.. For this publication, which was too licentious in attacking establishments, and has a vein of severity unseasoned by wit, he suffered an imprisonment for many months in the Marshalsea. Not being debarred the use of paper, pens and ink, he wrote during his confinement, an apology to James the first, under the title of A SATYRE, printed the following year, for his censures of the government in his first book. But, like Prynne in the pillory railing at the bishops, instead of the lenient language of recantation and concession, in this piece he still perseveres in his invectives against the court Reprinted 1615, 1622, 8vo.. Being taken prisoner in the rebellion, by the royalists, he was sentenced to be hanged; but sir John Denham the poet, prevailed with the king to spare his life, by telling his majesty, So long as Wither lives, I shall not be the worst poet in England. The revenge of our satirist was held so cheap, that he was lampooned by Taylor the water-poet The titles of Wither's numerous pieces may be seen in Wood, ATH. OXON. i. 392. seq. He was born in 1588, and died in 1667. He has left some anecdotes of the early part of his life, in the first book of his ABUSES, &. The OCCASION, p. 1. seq. In Hayman's Epigrams, 1628, there is one, "To the accute Satyrist, Master George Wither." EPIGR. 20. And 21. p. 61.Here might be mentioned, "ESSAYES and CHARACTERS, ironicall and instructive, &c, By John Stephens the younger, of Lincolnes inne, Gent." Lond. 1615. 12mo. Mine is a second impression. Many of the ESSAYES are Satires in verse.There is also a collection of Satyrical poems called the KNAVE OF HEARTS, 1612. Another, the KNAVE OF SPADES, 1611. And "Knaves yet, The Knaves of Spades and Diamonds. With new additions," 1612. 4to. Among Mr. Capell's SHAKESPERIANA, at Trinity college, Cambridge, are "Dobson's Dry Bobs," 1610, Bl. Let. 4to. And Heath's EPIGRAMS, 1610. 8vo.. Richard Brathwayte, a native of Northumberland,

 admitted at Oriel college, Oxford, in 1604, and afterwards a student at Cambridge, chiefly remembered, if remembered at all, as one of the minor pastoral poets of the reign of James the first, published in 1619, "NATVRES embassie, or the Wilde-mans measures, danced naked, by twelve Satyres, with sundry others, &c For R. Whitcher, 12mo. They were reprinted for the same, 1621. 12mo. In his satire on ADULTERIE, are these lines, p. 30.
And when you haue no favours to bestow,Lookes are the lures which drawe Affection's bow.
To these pieces is annexed, "The second Section of Divine and Morall Satyres, &c." This is dedicated to S. W. C. by R. B. See also Brathwayte's STRAPPADO for the Devil, 1615. 8vo.."—Donne's SATIRES were written early in the reign of James the first, though they were not published till after his death, in the year 1633. Jonson sends one of his Epigrams to Lucy Countess of Bedford, with MR. DONNES SATYRES EPIGR. xciii. See xcvi. Though Jonson's EPIGRAMS were printed in 1616, many were written long before. And among Freeman's Epigrams, RUN AND A GREAT CAST, 1614, we have the following. EPIGR. 84.
TO JOHN DONNE.The STORME described hath set thy name afloat,Thy CALME a gale of famous winde hath got:Thy SATYRS short too soone we them o'erlook,I prithee, Persius, write another booke!. It is conjectured by Wood, that a lively satirical piece, on the literature of the times, which I have already cited, with Donne's initials, and connected with another poem of the same cast, is one of Donne's juvenile performances. I had supposed John Davies. But I will again exhibit the whole title of the Bodleian edition. "A Scourge for paper-persecutors, by I. D. With an Inquisition against paper-persecutors, by A. H. London, for H. H. 1625," in quarto. But Wood had seen a detached edition of the former piece. He says, "Quaere, whether John Donne published A Scourge for Paper Persecutors, printed in quarto, tempore Jacobi

primi. The running title at the top of every page is PAPER'S COMPLAINT, in three sheets and a half. The date on the title pared out at the bottom ATH. OXON. i. 556. [See above, p. 81.] He thus ridicules the minute commemoration of unhistorical occurrences in the Chronicles of Hollinshead and Stowe. Signat. B. 3.
Some chroniclers that write of kingdom's states,Do so absurdly sableize my whiteWith maskes, and interludes, by day and night,Bald may games, beare baytings, and poore orations,Made to some prince, by some poore corporations.And if a bricke-bat from a chimney falls,When puffing Boreas nere so little bralls;Or wanton rig, or leacher dissolute,Doe stand at Paules-crosse in a sheeten sute:All these, and thousand such like toyes as these,They close in Chronicles like butterflies.And so confound grave matters of estateWith plaies of poppets, and I know not what.—Ah good sir Thomas More, fame be with thee,Thy hand did blesse the English historie!—As also when the weathercock of PaulesAmended was, this chronicler enroules, &c.—." This must have been an older edition, than that in which it appears connected, from similarity of subject, with its companion, An Inquisition against paper-persecutors, in the year 1625, as I have just noticed.Owen's idea of an epigram points out the notion which now prevailed of this kind of composition, and shews the propriety of blending the epigrams and satires of these times, under one class. A satire, he says, is an epigram on a larger scale. Epigrams are only satires in miniature. An epigram must be satyrical, and a satire epigrammatical Robert Hayman above quoted, thus recommends his own Epigrams. QUODLIBETS, B. iv. 19. p. 61.
Epigrams are like Satyrs, rough without,Like chesnuts sweet; take thou the kernell out.. And Jonson, in the Dedication of his EPIGRAMS to Lord Pembroke, was so far from viewing this species of verse, in its original plan, as the most harmless and inoffensive species of verse, that he supposes it to be conversant above the likenesse of vice and facts, and is conscious that epigrams carry danger in the sound. Yet in one of his epigrams, addressed TO THE MEERE ENGLISH CENSVRER,

he professes not exactly to follow the track of the late and most celebrated epigrammatists.To thee my way in EPIGRAMMES seemes newe,When both it is the old way and the true.Thou saist that cannot be: for thou hast seeneDAVIS, and WEEVER, and the BEST have BEENE,And mine come nothing like, &c EPIGR. xviii. Freeman also celebrates Davis, RUN AND A GREAT CAST, 1614. 4to. EPIGR. 100.
Haywood wrote Epigrams, and so did Davis,Reader, thou doubtest utrum horum mavis.In Dunbar's Latin Epigrams, published 1616, there is a compliment to Davies of Hereford, author of the SCOURGE OF FOLLY, as a Satyrist or epigrammatist. CENT. xx. p. 66..This, however, discovers the opinion of the general reader.Of the popularity of the epigram about the year 1600, if no specimens had remained, a proof may be drawn, together with evidences of the nature of the composition, from Marston's humourous character of Tuscus, a retailer of wit.But roome for Tuscus, that iest-moungering youth,Who neer did ope his apish gerning mouth,But to retaile and broke another's wit.Discourse of what you will, he straight can fit,Your present talke, with, Sir, I'll tell a iest,—Of some sweet ladie, or grand lord at least.Then on he goes, and neer his tongue shall lie,Till his ingrossed iests are all drawne dry:But then as dumbe as Maurus, when at play,Hath lost his crownes, and paun'd his trim array.He doth nought but retaile iests: breake but one,Out flies his table-booke, let him alone,He'll haue it i' faith: Lad, hast an EPIGRAM,Wil't haue it put into the chaps of Fame?
Giue Tuscus copies: sooth, as his own wit,His proper issue, he will father it, &c Sc. VILLAN. B. iii. 11..And the same author says, in his Postscript to PIGMALION,
Now by the whyppes of EPIGRAMMATISTS,I'll not be lash'd.—One of Harrington's Epigrams, is a comparison of the Sonnet and the Epigram.Once by mishap two poets fell a squaring,The Sonnet and our Epigram comparing.And Faustus hauing long demur'd vpon itYet at the last gaue sentence for the Sonnet,Now, for such censvre, this his chiefe defence is,Their sugred tast best likes his likrous senses.Well, though I grant sugar may please the tast,Yet let my verse haue salt to make it last EPIGR. B. i. 37..In the RETURN FROM PARNASSUS, acted 1616, perhaps written fome time before, Sir Roderick says, "I hope at length England will be wise enough: then an old knight may haue his wench in a corner, without any SATIRES or EPIGRAMS A. ii. S. 2.." In Decker's VNTRUSSING OF THE HUMOROUS POET, Horace, that is Jonson, exclaims in a passion, "Sirrah! I'll compose an EPIGRAM vpon him shall go thus—Edit. 1602. Sign. C. 2. Again, ibid.
