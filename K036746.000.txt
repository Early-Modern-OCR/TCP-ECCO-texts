CYRUS: A TRAGEDY.[Price One Shilling and Sixpence.]CYRUS: A TRAGEDY. As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN COVENT-GARDEN. BY JOHN HOOLE.LONDON: Printed for T. DAVIES, in Russel-Street, Covent-Garden.M. DCC. LXVIII.TO THE DUCHESS OF NORTHUMBERLAND, &c.MADAM,PERMIT me to assure YOUR GRACE of the deep sense I retain of Your great Goodness and Condescension in the Protection which You have been pleased to extend to my first Effort in the Drama.Were I to listen to those suggestions that naturally arise in the mind of a Writer, on the first dawnings of success, the favourable reception which this Tragedy has met with from the Public would lead me to hope that it might not be found wholly unworthy of YOUR GRACE'S Patronage: but when I reflect how many circumstances contribute to please on the Stage, where every Thought
or Expression is enforced with the graces of action and utterance, I cannot but be anxious lest the Reader should withhold that approbation in the closet which the Spectator testified in the representation.It is with the utmost Deference I submit the following Scenes to YOUR GRACE'S Perusal; and am,MADAM,with the greatest respect, YOUR GRACE'S most obliged most obedient and most devoted servant, JOHN HOOLE.Clement's Inn, 14 Dec. 1768.PROLOGUE.Spoken by Mr. SMITH.NEW to the stage, before this dread array,Prepar'd to offer here his virgin play,Our tim'rous Author, diffident of praise,Grafts his first laurels on another's bays;Takes from another's breast the gen'rous fire,And fits to English strains a foreign lyre:Aspires to please by unsuspected means,Importing passion from Italian scenes;Where heroes combate to soft music's note;And tyrants warble thro' an eunuch's throat:To symphony despairing lovers sigh;And struggling traitors by the gamut die!Yet here a living bard, whose fame out-runsThe foremost of the tunesul Drama's sons,Can ev'n in song his magic pow'r dispense,At once uniting harmony and sense.From him our poet now essays to write,And plans from him the story of to-night;A well-known tale—who has not heard the name:Of CYRUS, and the rising Median fame?Each puling school-boy can discuss the theme;The suff'ring grandson, and the monarch's dream.O! should his genius catch th' inspiring thought,And nobly copy what was nobly wrought;Or where the master's hand but sketch'd the line,With happy warmth fill up the bold design;Then ev'ry figure, with full force imprest,May wake the feelings of th' impassion'd breast;While each bright eye, amidst this circle, paysThe tribute of involuntary praise.Dramatis Personae.ASTYAGES, Mr. CLARKE.CAMBYSES, Mr. SMITH.CYRUS, Mr. POWELL.HARPAGUS, Mr. HULL.MITHRANES, Mr. BENSLEY.MIRZA, Mr. DAVIS.MANDANE, Mrs. YATES.ASPASIA, Mrs. MATTOCKS.Officer, Guards, Messenger, &c.SCENE on the Borders of Media.CYRUS: A TRAGEDY.ACT I.SCENE, A wood, a stately pavilion erected for ASTYAGES; view of a temple at a distance.MANDANE, ASPASIA.MANDANE.BEHOLD the limits of the Median land,And see the temple where AstyagesReturns each year to shed the victim's blood,On great Astarte's altar—O! Aspasia!This is the place, the day, nam'd by my father,To bless me with the tenderest interview;Here shall I meet again my long lost Cyrus:Is he not found, was he not snatch'd from death,Sav'd by some God to fill these eager arms!And is not this the happy destin'd grove,Where once again I shall embrace my child?ASPASIA.'Tis true—but what can all this passion mean?MANDANE.What can it mean!—where is my Cyrus hid?What does he?—wherefore comes he not?ASPASIA.Alas!Time, wing'd with swiftest pinions, lags behindThe ardent wishes of a mother's love.Thou know'st the hour of sacrifice is fix'dFor his reception; that we must not payOur vows to night's pale queen, till yonder sunDeclines to ev'ning skies, and now his beamsBut just begin to dawn o'er eastern hills.MANDANE.Alas! Aspasia,—still I fear—ASPASIA.And wherefore?When now Astyages no longer seeksHis death, but wishes to behold his Cyrus,To give him back a parent's kind protection,And shew, in him, our Media's future king?MANDANE.Yet if the visions of the night may claim.Belief—a dreadful dream—ASPASIA.And shall MandaneBe mov'd with shadows! sure you should detestSuch visionary fears; from these you firstMay date your sorrows: well you know, your father,On the vain credit of a dream, condemn'dYour Cyrus to be slain; nor this suffic'd;But that the nuptial bed no more might proveFruitful to thee in children, and to himGive endless cause of terror, far from henceTo banishment he sent your lord, your husband,Your dear Cambyses, where, in Persia's realmHe lives, an alien to his consort's arms.MANDANE.And yet 'tis not a dream that twice ten yearsHave seen the chearful harvest crown our fields,Since at his birth my child was ravish'd from me.On this blest day I hope once more to see him,And thinks Aspasia now to find me calm?ASPASIA.You lost your Cyrus when your age had scarceBeheld the round of thirteen annual suns;And can you still so deeply feel the griefImprest in life's first bloom?MANDANE.Alas! Aspasia,Thou know'st not what it is to be a mother.ASPASIA.Yet your Aspasia too has known her sorrows;If you lament a husband and a son,I mourn a brother's loss, who fell beneathThe vengeful anger of Astyages.MANDANE.There, there, my bosom shar'd thy father's sufferings,And oft I've wept in secret his misfortunes.Unhappy man! a fatal recompenseMy father gave?thee for his grandson sav'd!What hast thou suffer'd for thy love to Cyrus,Thy loyal truth!—but see, the good man comes,He comes, perchance, with tidings of my son—O haste, my Harpagus, where is he?Enter HARPAGUS.HARPAGUS.Princess,Your son is now arriv'd.MANDANE.Arriv'd!—ah!—where?HARPAGUS.He must not, till Astyages appears,Presume to pass the borders of the kingdom:'Tis so decreed.MANDANE.Then let us seek him outWhere now impatient, with long exil'd feet,He comes to tread his native wish'd-for soil,And ease a mother's pains.[Going.HARPAGUS.It must not be.Mandane, stay—your father will be present,A witness to your meeting.MANDANE.Wherefore thenThis long delay?—O did AstyagesFeel half Mandane feels, these arms had nowEmbrac'd my dearest Cyrus! what detainsMy father thus?HARPAGUS.'Ere now he's on his way;But the long pomp that waits on Media's kings,Forbids his swift approach.MANDANE.And must MandaneAttend the dull and tedious forms of state?Aspasia, if thou lov'st me, instant go,And seek the blooming youth—Yet stay, and hear me—Observe his air, his voice, his ev'ry look;Mark if his features bear his mother's likeness,Or his lov'd father's—But, als! I rave;Thou never knew'st his hapless banish'd father!Relate my sufferings, and enquire of his:Ask what kind hand supply'd a mother's care;How when, Mandane, torn with heart-felt anguish,Deem'd him a prey to savage rage, the woodsPreserv'd him in their hospitable shades.Tell him—O heaven! I know not what—but tell himMore than a mother's fondness can express,Not what I speak, but all I wish to utter.O fly! and with the rapid speed of thought,Return to my impatience.[Exit ASPASIA.HARPAGUS.Should this day,That gives once more your son to your embrace,Restore Cambyses to you—MANDANE.Would to heavenI might indulge that hope—All gracious powers!What torture in his exile must he feel,To hear his son yet lives; to know this dayRestores my Cyrus to his native land;Yet be deny'd to gaze with transport on him,Or clasp him in a father's sheltering arms!HARPAGUS.Hear, and be silent;—happier fortune nowPrepares to crown each wish your soul can form;Cambyses is at hand.MANDANE.Cambyses! where?O! tell me, Harpagus.HARPAGUS.I dare not furtherExplain it now—let this suffice.MANDANE.Alas!I fear thou dost deceive me.HARPAGUS.No, Mandane,Trust to my faith.—This day you shall behold him.MANDANE.Ye powers! what deluge of unhop'd-for blissNow bursts upon me! O my son! my husband!Happy Mandane—Harpagus, my friend,Teach me to bear this wild excess of joy.HARPAGUS.Be calm, compose your looks; let not the kingPerceive this conflict of tumultuous passions.MANDANE.Yes, I will go, and meet Astyages;Will strive to hide the strugglings of my soul,Check these emotions, though my swelling bosomCan scarce find room to hold the mighty transport;Transport, which only such as I can feel,And only those, who love like me, conceive.Exit.HARPAGUS alone.Thus far 'tis well.—This day I mean to shewThe hidden Cyrus to the expecting world.The realm is ripe for a revolt; the noblesResolve to invest him with the regal sway—But my resentment still demands its victim:Yes, dearest shade of my lamented son,For ever present to thy father's sight,Thou yet shalt be appeas'd; for this so longI've worn the mask of loyalty—but nowVengeance is on the wing she tow'rs alost,And, like an eagle, kens her destin'd prey.Exit.SCENE changes to a grove; outside of a sinall building of simple architecture, representing the dwelling of MITHRANES.Enter CYRUS and MITHRANES.CYRUS.Can it be possible? O say, my father,For such thou still hast been, am I indeedThe Median Cyrus? Sure I dream! am IThe offspring of Cambyses and Mandane?That wretched offspring, whom AstyagesSentenc'd to die, when scarce the vital spiritBreath'd from his infant lips.MITHRANES.Believe me, prince,Thou art that offspring.CYRUS.Tell me then, Mithranes,How many bear the name? Thou know'st alreadyOne Cyrus, on the borders of the landIs now arriv'd; and comes not here the kingTo welcome his approach?MITHRANES.The king's deceiv'd;That Cyrus is but feign'd—thou art the true.CYRUS.Whence is this mystery?MITHRANES.Astyages,When thou wert yet unborn, beheld a visionThat fill'd his soul, with dread.CYRUS.Of this, Mithranes,Thou need'st not speak; oft have I heard it told,How, from his dream, the magic had denounc'd,That of Mandane should a child be born,That must one day deprive him of his throne;And well I know at Cyrus' luckless birth,The rigid charge was given to Harpagus,To end his life, and ease a monarch's fears,MITHRANES.From thence begins a tale thou ne'er hast heard:The cruel sentence Harpagus receiv'd,His heart refus'd to obey; to me he brought thee,Wrapp'd in a regal mantle.CYRUS.Then 'twas thouThat in the woods expos'd—MITHRANES.Not so—be patient—My consort then (mark well the providenceThat watch'd thy preservation) had brought forthA lifeless child; thy harmless innocenceExcited pity; on thy tender cheekStood the big tear, as if thy heart alreadyWere conscious of misfortune, while thy handsWere stretch'd, as if to implore protection, from us.My Barce wept, and with a mother's fondness,Clasp'd in her arms, she strain'd thee to her bosom,Lull'd thee to rest, and hush'd thy little sorrows.CRYUS?Forgive me, sir, if gratitude awhileBreaks in upon your tale, and fills my eyesIn dear remembrance of your Barce's virtues;She whose indulgence watch'd my helpless years.MITHRANES.Tou wert, indeed, the darling of her age.As my own son I bred thee in these shades,And call'd thy name Alcaeus; in thy stead,Exposing in the wood the lifeless infant.CYRUS.What of Astyages?MITHRANES.When he believ'dHis dire command compleated, nature's voiceAt length awaken'd in his breast remorse.Full fifteen years did Harpagus remainWithout disclosing aught; then seem'd the taleRipe for discovery: yet he first would proveThe current's depth before he left the shore.Five years have now elaps'd, since thro' the realmThe tidings spread, that Cyrus being foundAn infant in the forest, was preserv'dAnd liv'd among the Scythians: such reportPerhaps the impostor rais'd, or from the rumourPerhaps he sprung: but be it as it may,Some bold adventurer, lur'd with hopes of greatness,Usurps thy name.CYRUS.Is this the Cyrus thenWho comes—MITHRANES.The same—but mark me—HarpagusProcur'd the fiction credit with the king;For thus he reason'd—should AstyagesWith joy receive the news, I safely mayReveal the kingdom's heir; or should his fearsOnce more return, and prompt some new designAgainst the prince, the baffled aim will lightUpon the impostor's head.CYRUS.But since the kingConfesses now such tenderness for Cyrus;At length recalls him from a life of exile,To clasp him to his bosom, wakens allThe soft endearments in a mother's soul,And every tender passion in a son;Wherefore should unavailing caution stillWithhold the secret from him?MITHRANES.HarpagusRelies not firmly on the royal goodness:For when he own'd, that with compassion mov'd,He had not slain the infant, but expos'd himAmidst the woods, Astyages to punishHis disobedience, doom'd to cruel deathHis only son; and though the king now seemsTo mourn his grandson's fate, and wears the semblanceOf deep remorse, yet sure but ill agreesSuch love for thee, with such resentment shewnAgainst thy kind preserver.CYRUS.Tell me ther,Why at this solemn pomp of sacrifice,Are all our country's nobles here conven'd,But to receive the lawful successor?And shall not Cyrus, conscious of his birth,Strip from a bold impostor his salse titles,And stand reveal'd to all? Oh! sir, by you,Ev'n 'midst these rude uncultivated wilds,My soul has long been train'd to virtuous daring;And shall I now ignobly lurk conceal'd?What can the subject hope from such a prince?That king will never guard his people's rights,Who wants the courage to assert his own.MITHRANES.O greatly urg'd—yet think not, my lov'd prince,Mithranes less regards thy fame, than safety.Suppress a few short hours this generous ardour;Soon as you sun shall reach the western waves,Thou shalt be shewn to all; thou shalt embraceThy parents yet unknown; th' assembled noblesShall own thy cause, and ev'n AstyagesReceive in thee the kingdom's better hope.CYRUS.What say'st thou? shall I then with filial transportEmbrace his honour'd knees, whom fate deny'dTo guard my youth with his paternal care?Hang on a mother's circling arms, that neverTill this blest moment clasp'd a banish'd son,And never rear'd his infant years with fondness?MITHRANES.Thou shalt, my prince; Cambyses will ere longArrive; already is Mandane here.CYRUS.Mandane!—let me fly to ease her breastOf every racking doubt, and dry the tearsOf an afflicted parent.[Going.MITHRANES.Hear me still—Cambyses and Mandane both supposeThe impostor is their son; and much it nowImports they should be still deceiv'd, till timeMatures our enterprize; for should MandaneLearn that in thee he lives—CYRUS.Fear not, Mithranes;This day the mighty secret shall remainLock'd in my breast; I never will reveal itTill thou permit'st me—let me but behold her—Farewell—Dost thou still doubt my faith—I callOn every God to witness to my vows.[Going.MITHRANES.Oh,—no, forbear—when wilt thou learn to curbThese eager sallies of unbridled passion?This is the awful day that teems with thineAnd Media's fate! Thou know'st that ev'ry deedMust first begin with Heav'n—Go, seek the temple,Devoutly there implore the gracious GodsTo smile propitious on our hopes, and learnHenceforth to moderate—What have I said?Cyrus forgive this licence of my tongue,So long accustom'd to a father's language;I now must change my speech—I am no moreThe rigid parent that reproves his son;I am a subject, that with faithful counselsWou'd aid his sov'reign.CYRUS.Thou art still my father,My dearest father—I confess my warmUngovern'd temper; but I will suppressThese starts of youth, and learn to tread the pathThy wisdom points: too dearly should I buyThe throne, if I no more must call thee fatherMITHRANES.Yes, royal youth, thou shalt be still my son,Son of my fondest hopes;—for thee I've, watch'dThe tedious round of twenty circling yearsEach turn of fate, in this sequester'd, dwelling,Far distant from the busy haunts of men,Where, but on this returning annual pompOf sacrifice, the print of human feetScarce marks the unworn turf.CYRUS.Once more farewell.Yes, I will seek yon hallow'd roof to raiseDevotion's voice, and supplicate the GodsTo breathe a hero's spirit in this breast;That when the ripening hours shall bring to lightThe wish'd events of this auspicious day,My soul, enlarg'd to thoughts of conscious greatness,May hail with virtuous pride its birth to glory.[Exit.MITHRANES.All gracious heav'n, with thy protecting armDefend my prince! Let me in one glad momentReap the full harvest of my pious toils,And old Mithranes then has liv'd enough—But see where Harpagus appears.Enter HARPAGUS.My friend,Where is Astyages?HARPAGUSBut now arriv'd:I left him in his tent in gloomy silence,As if revolving in his mind the endOf this day's sacrifice. He sends me hitherTo learn if Cyrus yet approach the bordersAnd what the train he brings.MITHRANES.Believ'st thou thenHe means, indeed, to answer Media's hopes,And give the realm a successor in Cyrus?HARPAGUS.Trust me, Mithranes, never.—If sometimesHe feigns a momentary joy, or speaksWith seeming fondness of the approach of Cyrus,Methinks thro' all the dark disguise appearsSome cruel purpose brooding in his soul.MITHRANES.Thanks to the pow'r that thus provides a victimTo frustrate ev'ry ill that thence might threatenThe safety of the prince: this bold impostor,Who wears his name, shall with his name inheritEach evil that's design'd him.HARPAGUS.Nor does MediaOwe less her thanks to heav'n, that gave MithranesTo rear her prince to every future greatness,In virtue's safest school, an humble station,Far from the splendid vices of a court,Where golden luxury, and silken sloth,Enervate our unhappy sons.—But say,Hast thou to Cyrus yet reveal'd his birth?MITHRANES.I have.HARPAGUS.And how did he receive the tidings?MITHRANES.Amaz'd at first he heard the important truth;But when convinc'd—O had you then beheldHis generous ardour;—scarce cou'd I preventHis filial love from seeking out Mandane,And throwing at her feet a darling son.HARPAGUS.Of that we must beware.—The weighty secretOf his concealment must not be entrustedTo a fond mother's transports: not CambysesKnows yet this mystery of fate.MITHRANES.'Tis strangeCambyses comes not yet.HARPAGUS.Doubt not, Mithranes,Cambyses will be present 'ere the hourFix'd for the sacrifice; perhaps ev'n nowHe lurks disguis'd upon the neighbouring confines.He must be wary; well thou know'st what dangerAwaits him, shou'd Astyages discoverHis mandate disobey'd—but let us part,We must not thus be found; the king may soonBe here; where'er he goes, pale visag'd fear,And black suspicion, on his steps attend.Exeunt severally.END of the FIRST ACT.ACT II.SCENE continues.Enter MITHRANES.CYRUS not yet return'd! still, still my breastOwns all the fears and fondness of a father—But hark! this way I hear the sound of feet—Some stranger by his dress—O mighty Gods!What do I see—sure I should know that face!Enter CAMBYSES disguis'd.CAMBYSES.If in this land you venerate the pow'rsOf hospitality, direct me, friend,To where the annual sacrifice is held:I come a votary from distant climes,To pay my offering at Astarte's shrine,And view the sacred pomp.MITHRANES.Myself will thitherConduct your steps—it must, it must be he.[Aside.CAMBYSES.The Gods, protectors of your Median race,Repay the courteous deed—but tell me farther;How may a friendless stranger gain accessTo princely Harpagus?MITHRANES.The king now holds himOn business of the state: this day the peopleExpect to find the kingdom's heir restor'd;If haply thou hast heard the name of Cyrus.CAMBYSES.Fame has thro' many a land divulg'd your story:I knew Cambyses; both in Persia born,One city bred us: I remember well,A private warrior, when he sought the courtOf Media's king, till by his merit rais'dHe gain'd Mandane's hand; but dearly sinceHe paid the price of love with years of exile.MITHRANES.Shall I yet speak [Aside.]—Since thou indeed hast known[To Cambyses.Unfortunate Cambyses—but beholdAstyages is near—avoid his presence:Thy garb would breed suspicion in the king,And danger to thyself—in that close covertA while remain conceal'd.[Cambyses retires.Enter ASTYAGES.ASTYAGES.Guards, keep the passAnd suffer none to enter here.[Speaks to Mirza entering.MITHRANES.[Aside.] What meansAstyages? has he beheld this stranger?Or has some spy in evil hour for Cyrus,Reveal'd the secret of his fate?ASTYAGES.Mithranes!MITHRANES.My sov'reign liege.ASTYAGES.Are we alone?MITHRANES.We are.ASTYAGES.Come near, Mithranes, tell me, dost thou stillRetain in mind remembrance of the goodI did thee once?MITHRANES.My mind retains it all.When first received into your royal courtI ow'd your bounty much; and when I leftThe pomp of cities for the sylvan wild,It was your hand that gave this wish'd retreat.ASTYAGES.Say, if my happiness, if all I soughtDepended on thy zeal, might I not thenExpect to find thee grateful?—answer me.MITHRANES.What is there in my power that can availThe welfare of my sov'reign?ASTYAGES.Yes, my friend,Thou can'st do much, can'st firmly fix the crownUpon thy sovereign's brow—know, all I seekIs in thy hand—yes, spite of our decree,Cyrus preserv'd—MITHRANES.What will my fate do with me![Aside.CAMBYSES.Did not my ears receive the name of Cyrus?[Listening.ASTYAGES.Thy colour fades; thou dost perhaps divineWhat I would say.MITHRANES.Thus prostrate at your feet—[Kneels.ASTYAGES.No, be not terrify'd, but rise—the deedIs easier than thy fears have form'd it—CyrusBelieves our summons, and already comes,With some few Scythians, on the kingdom's borders,To wait the expected meeting—well thou know'st,For years accustom'd to this rustic dwelling,Each outlet of the wood, and may'st with easeIn some close ambush so dispose of Cyrus,That he may never wake my terrors more.CAMBYSES.Inhuman murderer![Aside.ASTYAGES.What say'st thou, speak.MITHRANES.It shall be so,—my king shall be obey'd.[Aside.CAMBYSES.Most impious traytor![Aside.ASTYAGES.For the atttempt thyselfAlone will not suffice; thou must with careSelect thy trusty part'ners of the deed.MITHRANES.There needs no other but my son Alcaeus:'Twere dangerous to confide to other hands,An enterprize of such import—Alcaeus,Skill'd in the winding mazes of the wood,Thro' which, at early dawn, he oft' is wontTo urge the savage chace, shall unsuspectedReach with a distant shart his life—ASTYAGES.Enough—'Tis well conceiv'd—go then, my best Mithranes,Instruct thy son; tell him, AstyagesExpects from him the end of all his terrors;The deed once done I plant him next my heart,To grow to wealth and honours.MITHRANES.Heavenly pow'rs![Aside.Defend me still, and from suspicion's eyePreserve yon stranger![Exit.ASTYAGES.Now, methinks, my mindIs eas'd of ev'ry fear—Let Cyrus die,And with him die the many doubts that shakeThe bosom of Astyages.Enter CAMBYSES.CAMBYSES.RevokeThe dreadful mandate which thy lips pronounc'd,On by th' eternal gods, the great avengersOf guiltless blood—ASTYAGES.Ha! traitor! what art thou,That lurking thus unfeen—death be thy portion.[Draws.CAMBYSES.Nay then—[Draws.ASTYAGES.Off, peasant!—dar'st thou lift thy handA gainft the sun's vicegerent!—Enter MIRZA and guards.MIRZA.Seize the ruffian,And instant drag him hence.[Cambyses is disarmed, and at a signal from ASTYAGES the guards retire.ASTYAGES.Audacious villain!Know'ft thou what punishment awaits thy crime?Already torture shakes his scorpions o'er thee,And anguish claims thee as her destin'd prey:Confess what motives urg'd thy desperate deed.CAMBYSES.Whate'er my motives, know, the soul that daresAttempt a tyrant's life, has fortitudeTo brave whate'er a tyrant can inflict.ASTYAGES.Presumptuous slave!CAMBYSES.Look here, Astyages,View well this face; do not these features wakeThy recollection? Twice ten years of suff'ranceHave wrought some change, yet sure here still remainsThe trace of what I have been.ASTYAGES.Ha! whate'er?Thou art, rightly my better genius warn'd me,That something baneful to my nature, lurk'dBeneath those abject vestments.CAMBYSES.Tyrant, yes;'Tis not for nought thy conscience takes the alarm▪For he's that injur'd ever is the baneOf him that injures; let this meeting thenRouse each awak'ning terror in thy soul,To see the man thou most hast wrong'd—Cambyses,[Throws open his disguise.ASTYAGES.Thou wretch! how hast thou dar'd to enter MediaAgainst our high decree? And com'st thou too,Assassin like, with sacrilegious rageTo lift thy hand against a monarch's life?But thou shalt find a welcome.CAMBYSES.Yes, such welcomeAs thy paternal love prepares for Cyrus;Thou hoary ruffian! was it then for thisThe nobles of the realm were summon'd here?For this was Cyrus call'd, to fall a victimTo thy death-dealing minion—curs'd Mithranes!ASTYAGES.Confusion! am I then betray'd?[Aside.CAMBYSES.For me!I scorn thy feeble menaces; I knowMy life awaits thy nod—but mark me well,The time may come, ev'n now perhaps the black,The fatal hour impends, when thou shalt feelThe avenging hand of heaven.ASTYAGES.What say'st thou, ha!Does secret treason lurk amid the smilesOf seeming loyalty? Give me to knowWhat mischief threatens.CAMBYSES.Seek to know no more;Let it suffice I've given thy terrors birth,And be it thine to cherish them.AsTYAGES.Ho! guards!Convey this traytor to yon city's walls,And lay him in some loathsome dungeon; there,There shalt thou learn to speak.CAMBYSES.Thy rage is fruitless;Hope not from me to be inform'd of aughtThat may import thy safety.ASTYAGES.Lead him hence—I'll hear no further—shall a wretch proscrib'dRevile the awful majesty of kings;And dare his anger, whose all-pow'rful wordCan in a moment six his doom?—Away.CAMBYSES.Come, whither must I go? Conduct me whereThe cavern'd earth unfolds her deepest prison,Where light ne'er dawns; yet steady virtue thereShall dissipate the gloom; there the firm soulShall smile in torture, when amidst the blazeOf courts, the tyrant's mind shall shrink in darkness,And while security surrounds his throne,Trembles with fancy'd terror![Exit guarded.Manent ASTYAGES and MIRZA.ASTYAGES.Yes, I feelHis threats already here; my lab'ring breastTeems with new fears—Mirza.MIRZA, coming forward.What would my sov'reign?ASTYAGES.Whence did this daring rebel break upon us,And how elude thy vigilance?MIRZA.My lord,No steps un-notic'd could have pass'd the guard;Cambyses must have lurk'd in secret hereBeneath some neighbouring shade; nor knew we aughtOf danger near your person, till the soundOf tumult brought us to your timely rescue.ASTYAGES aside.What should I think? is then Mithranes false?Mirza, I thank thy zeal; be ever thusAnd I'll reward thee—sure some deep designIs brooding now against me—Enter MANDANE.MANDANE.Hear me, sir,O! by these tears—ASTYAGES.What would my daughter? rise—MANDANE.O never, never,—here I'll grow to earth'Till pity, kindling in a father's breast,Extend a gracious hand to save Cambyses.ASTYAGES.Cambyses!—name him not.MANDANE.Alas! my father,After a tedious twenty years of absence,Fate now returns him, but returns in vain,If, by your anger, he's deny'd to viewHis lov'd Mandane, to behold his sonPreserv'd; but ah! for him preserv'd in vain!ASTYAGES.Had'st thou, Mandane, heard his rebel threats,His daring insults breath'd against the throne—MANDANE.Forgive the transport of a bosom, tornWith double pangs, the father, and the husband:Alas! perhaps, he knew not Cyrus liv'd,He knew not that Astyages had fix'dThis day, to meet and name him for his heir.ASTYAGES.And pleads my daughter in defence of himWhose impious hand assail'd my life?MANDANE.O heaven!ASTYAGES.Tell me, when treason works the secret mineTo sap my kingdom, shall Mandane's tongueExtenuate his offence who plans my fall?But thou, perhaps, art privy to their wiles,Perhaps confederate with thy father's foes.MANDANE.What do I hear? And can you thoughts suggest(My soul is chill'd with horror) that MandaneWould join in murder's black conspiracyAgainst the hand that gave me life?ASTYAGES.I know not—Whom should I fear? Methinks I see rebellionWhere duty's most profess'd! and those my powerCan shake with terror, give me equal dread:But for Cambyses, would'st thou prove thy truth,Name him no more—thus much a father-grants,He shall not die—I to your tears remitHis forfeit life, which else had fall'n the victimOf torture's sharpest pangs—but as I prizeMy crown, again he's banish'd from the land.[Exit.MANDANE.And is it thus my fate begins to smile?Is this the meeting Harpagus foretold!O! my Cambyses!Enter CYRUS.What art thou, that break'stThus importunely on my grief?CYRUS.ForgiveThis seeming rudeness, beauteous excellence;A son of freedom, nurtur'd in these woods,Now shuns a fate, that threats that libertyWhich bounteous nature gave.MANDANE.What dost thou mean?CYRUS.The royal guards pursue my steps, and soonThese limbs, that 'till this hour, have rang'd at largeO'er the steep hill, or through the forest shade,May seel the galling weight of servile chainsMANDANE.Declare thy crime.CYRUS.My crime was self-defence:Th' oppressor's sword was rais'd again?s;t my life,But heav'n then nerv'd my strength, and from this armThe wretch receiv'd that death he meant to give.MANDANE.What means my throbbing bosom?—Gentle youth,Proceed—methinks I feel some secret impulseTo listen to thy story.CYRUS.As but nowAlone I sought the temple, from the woodsI heard a cry of deep distress:—I turn'dAnd saw two ruffians seize a beauteous maid;Fir'd at the brutal deed I cast my dart,And one I slew; the other, struck with terror,Forsook th' affrighted fair, who trembling fled,And ere I could pursue her stops, a youthOf fierce demeanour, clad in rich attire,With sword unsheath'd, impetuous cross'd my way,And menac'd vengeance for his slain companion—But see the nymph herself, whom fav'ring heav'nSent me to save.Enter ASPASIA.MANDANE.Wert thou the maid distress'd?And is it true, that thou hast 'scap'd the armOf brutal violence?ASPASIA.Yes, sell destructionWas hov'ring o'er me, when behold the friend,That freed Aspasia from impending ruin,With peril of his own—but, thanks to heav'n,My brave defender lives.—Say, gallant youth,How did'st thou 'scape the ruffian's boist'rous rage,That threaten'd thee with death?MANDANE.Relate the sequel;For since Aspasia bears an interest in it,My heart more freely listens to thy tale.CYRUS.But little now remains—the fierce invaderStill press'd upon me, whilst a river flow'dBehind my steps, preventing all retreat;Disarm'd, what could I do? NecessitySupply'd me with new arms; sudden I snatch'dA craggy flint from the rough pebbled shore,And launch'd against the foe; a sanguine streamBath'd all his face, the sword forsook his hand,And as he stagger'd round, with dying graspHe seiz'd a bough, that over-hung the tide,Which yielding to his weight, at once he fell,And in the waves was lost.MANDANE.Is this the crimeThat justice should pursue? Yes, my Aspasia,'Midst all the anguish of a breaking heart,I feel a dawn of joy for thy deliverance.ASPASIA.What new distress afflicts Mandane?CYRUS.Gods![Aside.Was it Mandane whom I thus unknownHave held in converse?MANDANE.Oh!

Is it compassion,Or gratitude to him whose valour sav'd me?Ah! no—I fear a gentler cause excitesThese strange emotions—Spite of all the prideMy sex and rank inspire—I love Alcaeus:This sylvan hero bears down my resolvesThat still have prov'd in vain: when with my fatherChance led me first to visit good Mithranes,I gaz'd with pleasure on his blooming son;Again I saw, yet knew not that I lov'd him,'Till this day's act that sav'd me from dishonour—And yet for this day's act Alcaeus dies—And shall he die for thee?—Ah! no, Aspasia,The guilt was thine, thy fate has murder'd Cyrus;Then let me seek the king, plead for Alcaeus,And for his forfeit life lay down my own.[Exit.END of the SECOND ACT.ACT III.SCENE, A Wood.

Is AlcaeusMy son, my dearest Cyrus?MITHRANES.Peace, Mandane,O heavens! be heedful.MANDANE.Where is now the danger?MITHRANES.Danger is ev'ry where: when crueltyExtends her iron reign, we ne'er can keepToo strict a guard upon our speech: a dreamMay rouze the slumbering fury: fell suspicionOn innocence will stamp the mark of guilt,And tyranny assumes the mien of justiceTo punish crimes that never yet had being.The genial feast, the nuptial bed, the templesAre not secure from treachery.MANDANE.At leastConfirm my doubting thoughts.MITHRANES.What further proofCan you require? Ask your own heart, Mandane;Your heart will testify a mother's feeling.MANDANE.'Tis true, 'tis true—O! I remember all—When first I view'd Alcaeus, how my bloodThrill'd with some unknown passion! Why, Mithranes,Wou'd'st thou so long conceal him from my love?MITHRANES.I fear'd to trust maternal tenderness,Which wisdom ill can rule; had not your sorrowsAwak'd my pity, had I not suspectedThe worst from your revenge against Alcaeus,To you your son had still remain'd unknown.MANDANE.And yet Mandane's wretched, envious fortune,Spite of the sunshine that would gild the prospect,Spreads o'er my day affliction's sable clouds.Cyrus return'd and living must exciteA mother's dearest transports; but CambysesReturn'd, and doom'd again to banishment,Unseen, unwelcom'd, swells this heart with anguish.MITHRANES.Alas! my princess, calm your grief; let hopePoint you to future scenes of happiness:Heav'n that preserv'd your Cyrus, will againRestore Cambyses to your longing arms,And give him back to liberty and love.MANDANE.Fain would I listen to the flattering soundsOf happiness and peace—But yet, Mithranes,Thou hast not told the fortunes of my child:Relate whate'er his tender youth has suffer'd,By what strange means—declare each circumstance.MITHRANES.Some fitter time must tell thee—in the groveThat leads to my retreat—meet me ere long,And thou shalt learn it all—but soft; from farI see the king approaching.MANDANE.Let us fly,And bear to him the news that Cyrus lives.MITHRANES.O hold! 'twas this I fear'd—MANDANE.Thou know'st my sonIs now a prisoner.MITHRANES.But consent to leave me,And keep his birth still secret from your father,I plight my life to free him from his chains,And give him to your arms.MANDANE.Is't possible?And may Mandane in thy faith confide?MITHRANES.Confide in me!—Almighty powers! is this,This the reward for all my loyal service!Is then my truth suspected!MANDANE.O! forgiveTh' involuntary doubt, forgive the thoughtsOf one, who long the mark of sorrow's shafts,Distrusts each promids'd joy—I know thy goodness;Yes, thou wilt still prevent my busy fears,Minister to my hopes with faithful hand,And to preserve the mother, save the son.[Exit.MITHRANES.Mandane, yes—still in this care-worn breast,Thy Cyrus lives; time, that unnerves these limbs,Strengthens my loyal truth—be these white locksAn emblem of my faith—But see the king,Impatient for the news for Cyrus' fate.Enter ASTYAGES.ASTYAGES.Mithranes!MITHRANES.Sir, your mandate is obey'd,Be ev'ry fear that Cyrus rais'd, forgotten,For Cyrus is no more.ASTYAGES.I know it well:How do I stand indebted to thy zeal:And yet, my friend, all is not here at ease,I fear our secret is betray'd; CambysesReproach'd me with the purpos'd deed; Mithranes,Tell me what says report? Does the loud tongueOf popular invective point at me,Or does suspicion sleep?MITHRANES.No rumour yet,Of this, my lord, has reach'd my watchful ear;Your guards convey'd Cambyses pris'ner hence,Nor aught from him has rouz'd the public noticeRespecting what your thoughts suggest.ASTYAGES.Enough—Retire my friend.MITHRANES.Permit me to remindMy sovereign master, that my son Alcaeus—ASTYAGES.I know what thou would'st say—thy son's in honds;Already have I in my thoughts resolv'dTo set him free, to heap rewards upon him;But yet we must beware, it might be dangerousAt once to pardon him whom all the realmMust mark for open vengeance; such proceedingMight give a sanction to whate'er the breathOf discontent might raise against their king.Trust to my care—I'll watch th' important crisis—Farewell, Mithraues.[Exit MITHRANES.ASTYAGES.O!

(he cry'd) you quite mistake the thing;Astyages you'll find—had dreamt—the king—I stop'd him short—perhaps it may be true,That your old nature differs from your new.From various causes equal sorrows flow,All realms and times have some peculiar woe:With us what griefs from ills domestic rise,When now a beau—and now a monkey dies!In this our iron age, still harder lot,A masquerade, no ticket to be got—Your obsolete distress may now be told—Let's see—there's ravishing—that's very old.There's love that scorn'd a title and estate—These woes of love are vastly ou? of date!Then there's your martyr to his country's weal—What strange distress these ancients us'd to seel!The love of country now indeed runs high;They prove its value most, who dearest buy;Think what our patriots pay in sterling gold,A single borough for seven years to hold.Tho' here in statu quo I still remain,I've oft been married, ravish'd, erown'd and slain!None of all these have been my  to-night,So us'd to fancy'd angu and light;Yet let me hope you felt the part I bore,Give me your plaudit— can wish no more.FINIS.
