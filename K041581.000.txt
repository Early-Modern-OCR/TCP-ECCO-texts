Hop GardenPOEMS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.BY CHRISTOPHER SMART, A. M. Fellow of Pembroke-Hall, Cambridge.—nonumque prematur in annum. HOR.LONDON: Printed for the AUTHOR, by W. STRAHAN; And sold by J. NEWBERY, at the Bible and Sun, in St. Paul's Church-yard. MDCCLII.To the RIGHT HONOURABLE the EARL of MIDDLESEX.My LORD,THE Critics will, undoubtedly, expect, when they see your Name prefixed to this Volume, that I should address your Lordship, as the Judge of Science, and the hereditary Patron of learned Men; but I shall take the Liberty of disappointing them, having, as I presume, a stronger and more natural Claim to your Protection from a lucky Accident, than from any real Excellence I can pretend to, either as a Writer or a Scholar.This lucky Accident, my Lord, is the Honour (I had almost said Merit) of being born within a few Miles of your Lordship; and tho' I have too much Diffidence to ask your Patronage

as a Poet, I have Assurance enough to demand it as a Man of Kent.I shall not imitate, in this Dedication (if such an homely Epistle may aspire to so polite a Name) the Conduct of most modern Authors, who are always particularly fulsome, at the very Time they, with the utmost Solemnity, protest against Flattery—What I sincerely believe of you I have said already, and you will find it in the introductory Ode on Good-nature, which I beg Leave, in an especial Manner, not only to inscribe, but to apply to the Earl of Middlesex.I am, my Lord, with the utmost Respect,Your Lordship's most obedient, and most obliged humble Servant, CHRISTOPHER SMART.LIST OF SUBSCRIBERS NAMES.ASIR John Abdy, Bart.Sir Jacob Ashley, Bart.Nathanial Acton, EsqMrs. AcworthThe Rev.

The former on Good-Nature, the latter against Ill-Nature.On GOOD-NATURE.I.HAIL cherub of the highest Heav'n,Of look divine, and temper ev'n,Celestial sweetness, exquisite of mien,Of ev'ry virtue, ev'ry praise the queen!II.Soft gracefulness, and blooming youth,Where, grafted on the stem of truth,That friendship reigns, no interest can divide,And great humility looks down on pride.III.Oh! curse on Slander's vip'rous tongue,That daily dares thy merit wrong;Ideots usurp thy title, and thy frame,Without or virtue, talent, taste, or name.IV.Is apathy, is heart of steel,Nor ear to hear, nor sense to feel,Life idly inoffensive such a grace,That it shou'd steal thy name and take thy place?V.No—thou art active—spirit all—Swifter than light'ning, at the callOf injur'd innocence, or griev'd desert,And large with liberality's thy heart.VI.Thy appetites-in easy tides(As reason's luminary guides)Soft flow—no wind can work them to a storm,Correctly quick, dispassionately warm.VII.Yet if a transport thou canst feel'Tis only for thy neighbours weal:Great, generous acts thy ductile passions move,And smilingly thou weep'st with joy and love.VIII.Mild is thy mind to cover shame,Averse to envy, slow to blame,Bursting to praise, yet still sincere and freeFrom flatt'ry's fawning tongue, and bending knee.IX.Extensive, as from west to east,Thy love descends from man to beast,Nought is excluded little, or infirm,Thou canst with greatness stoop to save a worm.X.Come, goddess, come with all thy charmsFor Oh! I love thee, to my arms—All, all my actions guide, my fancy feed,So shall existence then be life indeed.Against ILL-NATURE.I.OFSPRING of folly and of pride,To all that's odious, all that's  allied;Nurs'd up by vice, by pravity missed,By pedant affectation taught and bred:Away, thou hideous hell-born spright,Go, with thy looks of dark design,Sullen, sour, and saturnine;Fly to some gloomy shade, nor blot the goodly light.Thy planet was remote, when I was born;'Twas Mercury that rul'd my natal morn,What time the sun exerts his genial ray,And ripens for enjoyment every growing day;When to exist is but to love and sing,And sprightly Aries smiles upon the spring.II.There in yon lonesome heath,Which Flora, or Sylvanus never knew,Where never vegetable drank the dew,Or beast, or fowl attempts to breathe;Where Nature's pencil has no colours laid;But all is blank, and universal shade;Contrast to figure, motion, life and light,There may'st thou vent thy spight,For ever cursing, and for ever curs'd,Of all th' infernal crew the worst;
The worst in genius, measure and degree;For envy, hatred, malice, are but parts of thee.III.Or woud'st thou change the scene, and quit thy den,Behold the heav'n-deserted fen,Where spleen, by vapours dense begot and bred,Hardness of heart, and heaviness of head,Have rais'd their darksome walls, and plac'd their thorny bed;There may'st thou all thy bitterness unload,There may'st thou croak, in concert with the toad,With thee the hollow howling winds shall join,Nor shall the bittern her base throat deny,The querulous frogs shall mix their dirge with thine,Th' ear-piercing hern, and plover screaming high,While million humming gnats fit oestrum shall supply.IV.Away—away—behold an hideous bandAn herd of all thy minions are at hand,Suspicion first with jealous caution stalks,And ever looks around her as she walks,With bibulous ear imperfect sounds to catch,And prompt to listen at her neighbours latch.Next Scandal's meagre shade,Foe to the virgins, and the poet's fame,A wither'd, time-deflow'red old maid,That ne'er enjoy'd love's ever sacred flame.
Hypocrisy succeeds with saint-like look,And elevates her hands and plods upon her book.Next comes illiberal scrambling Avarice,Then Vanity and Affectation nice—See, she salutes her shadow with a bowAs in short Gallic trips she minces by,Starting antipathy is in her eye,And squeamishly she knits her scornful brow.To thee, Ill-Nature, all the numerous groupWith lowly reverence stoop—They wait thy call, and mourn thy long delay,Away—thou art infectious—haste away.A MORNING PIECE, OR, AN HYMN for the HAY-MAKERS. ODE I.Quinetiam Gallum noctem explaudentibus alisAuroram clarâ consuetum voce vocare. LUCRET.BRISK chaunticleer his mattins had begun,And broke the silence of the night,And thrice he call'd aloud the tardy sun,And thrice he hail'd the dawn's ambiguous light;Back to their graves the fear-begotten phantoms run.Strong Labour got up with his pipe in his mouth,And stoutly strode over the dale,He lent new perfumes to breath of the south,On his back hung his wallet and flail.Behind him came Health from her cottage of thatch,Where never physician had lifted the latch.
First of the village Colin was awake,And thus he sung, reclining on his rake.Now the rural graces threeDance beneath yon maple tree;First the vestal Virtue, knownBy her adamantine zone;Next to her in rosy pride,Sweet Society, the bride;Last Honesty, full seemly drestIn her cleanly home-spun vest.The abby bells in wak'ning roundsThe warning peal have giv'n;And pious Gratitude resoundsHer morning hymn to heav'n.All nature wakes—the birds unlock their throats,And mock the shepherd's rustic notes.All alive o'er the lawn,Full glad of the dawn,The little lambkins play,Sylvia and Sol arise,—and all is day—Come, my mates, let us work,And all hands to the fork,While the Sun shines, our Hay-cocks to make,So fine is the Day,And so fragrant the Hay,That the Meadow's as blithe as the Wake.Our voices let's raiseIn Phoebus's praise,Inspir'd by so glorious a theme,Our musical wordsShall be join'd by the birds,And we'll dance to the tune of the stream.A NOON-PIECE; OR, The MOWERS at Dinner. ODE II.Jam pastor umbras cum grege languido,Rivumque fessus quaerit, & horridiDumeta Silvani, caretqueRipa vagis taciturna ventis. HOR.THE Sun is now too radiant to behold,And vehement he sheds his liquid Rays of Gold;No cloud appears thro' all the wide expanse;And short, but yet distinct and clear,To the wanton whistling airThe mimic shadows dance.Fat Mirth, and Gallantry the gay,And romping Extasy 'gin play.Now Myriads of young Cupids rise,And open all their joy-bright eyes,Filling with infant prate the grove,And lisp in sweetly-fault'ring love.In the middle of the ring,Mad with May, and wild of wing,Fire-ey'd Wantonness shall sing.By the rivulet on the rushes,Beneath a canopy of bushes,Where the ever-faithful Tray,Guards the dumplings and the whey,Colin Clout and Yorkshire WillFrom the leathern bottle swill.Their scythes upon the adverse bankGlitter 'mongst th' entangled trees,Where the hazles form a rank,And court'sy to the courting breeze.Ah! Harriot! sovereign mistress of my heart,Could I thee to these meads decoy,New grace to each fair object thou'dst impart,And heighten ev'ry scene to perfect joy.On a bank of fragrant thyme,Beneath you stately, shadowy pine,We'll with the well-disguised hookCheat the tenants of the brook;Or where coy Daphne's thickest shadeDrives amorous Phoebus from the glade,There read Sydney's high-wrought storiesOf ladies charms and heroes glories;Thence fir'd, the sweet narration act,And kiss the fiction into fact.Or satiate with nature's random scenes,Let's to the gardens regulated greens,Where taste and elegance commandArt to lend her daedal hand,Where Flora's flock, by nature wild,To discipline are reconcil'd,And laws and order cultivate,Quite civiliz'd into a state.From the sun, and from the show'r,Haste we to you boxen bow'r,Secluded from the teizing pryOf Argus' curiosity:There, while Phoebus' golden mean,The gay meridian is seen,Ere decays the lamp of light,And length'ning shades stretch out to night—Seize, seize the hint—each hour improve(This is morality in love)Lend, lend thine hand—O let me viewThy parting breasts, sweet avenue!Then—then thy lips, the coral cellWhere all th' ambrosial kisses dwell!Thus we'll each sultry noon employIn day-dreams of exstatic joy.A NIGHT-PIECE; OR, MODERN PHILOSOPHY. ODE III.Dicetur meritâ nox quoque noeniâ. HOR.'TWAS when bright Cynthia with her silver car,Soft stealing from Endymion's bed,Had call'd forth ev'ry glitt'ring star,And up th' ascent of heav'n her brilliant host had led.Night, with all her negro train,Took possession of the plain;
In an hearse she rode reclin'd,Drawn by screech-owls slow and blind:Close to her, with printless feet,Crept Stillness, in a winding sheet.Next to her deaf Silence was seen,Treading on tip toes over the green;Softly, lightly, gently she trips,Still holding her fingers seal'd to her lips.You could not see a sight,You could not hear a sound,But what confess'd the night,And horror deepen'd round.Beneath a myrtle's melancholy shade,Sophron the wise was laid:And to the answ'ring wood these sounds convey'd:While others toil within the town,And to Fortune smile or frown,Fond of trifles, fond of toys,And married to that woman, Noise;Sacred Wisdom be my care,And fairest Virtue, Wisdom's heir.His speculations thus the sage begun,When, lo! the neighbouring bellIn solemn sound struck one:—He starts—and recollects—he was engag'd to Nell.Then up he sprang nimble and light,And rapp'd at fair Ele'nor's door;He laid aside virtue that night,And next morn por'd in Plato for more.On the sudden Death of a CLERGYMAN. ODE IV.IF, like th' Orphean lyre, my song could charm,And light to life the ashes in the urn,Fate of his iron dart I would disarm,Sudden as thy decease should'st thou return,Recall'd with mandates of despotic sounds,And arbitrary grief, that will not hear of bounds.But, ah! such wishes, artless muse, forbear;'Tis impotence of frantic love,Th' enthusiastic flight of wild despair,To hope the Thracian's magic power to prove.Alas! thy slender vein,Nor mighty is to move, nor forgetive to feign,Impatient of a rein,Thou canst not in due bounds the struggling measures keep,—But thou, alas! canst weep—Thou canst—and o'er the melancholy bierCanst lend the sad solemnity a tear.Hail! to that wretched corse, untenanted and cold,And hail the peaceful shade loos'd from its irksome hold.
Now let me say thou'rt free,For sure thou paid'st an heavy tax for life,While combating for thee,Nature and mortalityMaintain'd a daily strife.High, on a slender thread thy vital lamp was plac'd,Upon the mountain's bleakest brow,To give a nobler light superior was it rais'd,But more expos'd by eminence it blaz'd;For not a whistling wind that blew,Nor the drop-descending dew,Nor a bat that idly flew,But half extinguish'd its fair flame—but nowSee—hear the storms tempestuous sweep—Precipitate it falls—it falls—falls lifeless in the deep.Cease, cease, ye weeping youth,Sincerity's soft sighs, and all the tears of truth.And you, his kindred throng, forbearMarble memorials to prepare,And sculptur'd in your breasts his busto wear.'Twas thus when Israel's legislator dy'd,No fragile mortal honours were supply'd,But even a grave denied.Better than what the pencil's daub can give,Better than all that Phidias ever wrought,Is this—that what he taught shall live,And what he liv'd for ever shall be taught.On the Fifth of December, being the Birth-day of a beautiful young Lady. ODE V.I.HAIL, eldest of the monthly train,Sire of the winter drear,December, in whose iron reignExpires the chequer'd Year.Hush all the blust'ring blasts that blow,And proudly plum'd in silver snow,Smile gladly on this blest of Days.The livery'd clouds shall on thee wait,And Phoebus shine in all his stateWith more than summer rays.II.Tho' jocund June may justly boastLong days and happy hours,Tho' August be Pomona's host,And May be crown'd with flow'rs;Tell June, his fire and crimson dies,By Harriot's blush and Harriot's eyes,Eclips'd and vanquish'd, fade away:Tell August, thou canst let him seeA richer, riper fruit than he,A sweeter flow'r than May.The PRETTY CHAMBERMAID: In Imitation of Ne sit Ancillae tibi amor pudori, &c. of Horace.

Each hero kiss'd his maid, and why,Tho' I'm no hero, may not I?IV.Who knows? Perhaps Polly may beA piece of ruin'd royalty.She has (I cannot doubt it) beenThe daughter of some mighty queen;But fate's irremeable doomHas chang'd her sceptre for a broom.V.Ah! cease to think it—how can she,So generous, charming, fond, and free,So lib'ral of her little store,So heedless of amassing more,Have one drop of plebeian blood,In all the circulating flood?VI.But you, by carping at my fire,Do but betray your own desire—Howe'er proceed—made tame by years,You'll raise in me no jealous fears.You've not one spark of love alive,For, thanks to heav'n, you're forty-five.IDLENESS.

ODE VIII.I.'TWAS when th' omniscient creative pow'rDisplay'd his wonders by a mortal's hand,And, delegated at th' appointed hour,Great Moses led away his chosen band;When Israel's host, with all their stores,Past thro' the ruby-tinctur'd crystal shores,The wilderness of waters and of land:Then persecution rag'd in heav'n's own cause,And right on neighbouring kingdoms to infringe,Strict justice for the breach of nature's laws,Strict justice, who's full-sister to revenge:The legislator held the scythe of fate,Where'er his legions chanc'd to stray,Death and destruction mark'd their bloody way;Immoderate was their rage, for mortal was their hate.II.But when the king of righteousness arose,And on the illumin'd East serenely smil'd,He shone with meekest mercy on his foes,Bright as the sun, but as the moon-beams mild;From anger, fell revenge, and discord free,He bad war's hellish clangor cease,In pastoral simplicity and peace,And shew'd to men that face, which Moses could not see.III.Well hast thou, WEBSTER, pictur'd christian love,And copied our great master's fair design,But livid Envy would the light remove,Or croud thy portrait in a nook malign—The Muse shall hold it up to popular view—Where the more candid and judicious fewShall think the bright original they see,The likeness nobly lost in the identity.IV.Oh hadst thou liv'd in better days than these,E'er to excel by all was deem'd a shame!Alas! thou hast no modern arts to please,And to deserve is all thy empty claim▪Else thou'dst been plac'd, by learning, and by wit,There, where thy dignify'd inferiors sit—
Oh they are in their generation wise,Each path of interest they have sagely trod,—To live—to thrive—to rise—and still to rise—Better to bow to men, than kneel to God.V.Behold!—where poor unmansion'd Merit stands,All cold, and crampt with penury and pain;Speechless thro' want, she rears th' imploring hands,And begs a little bread, but begs in vain;While Bribery and Dulness, passing by,Bid her, in sounds barbarian, starve and die."Away (they cry (we never saw thy name)"Or in Preferment's List, or that of Fame;"Away—nor here the fate thou earn'st bewail,"Who canst not buy a vote, nor hast a soul for sale.VI.Oh Indignation, wherefore wert thou given,If drowsy Patience deaden all thy rage?—Yet we must bear—such is the will of heaven;And, WEBSTER, so prescribes thy candid page.Then let us hear thee preach seraphic love,Guide our disgusted thoughts to things above;So our free souls, fed with divine repast,(Unmindful of low mortals mean employ)Shall taste the present, recollect the past,And strongly hope for every future joy.ODE IX.

ODE XI.I.DEscend, descend, ye sweet Aonian maids,Leave the Parnassian shades,The joyful Hymeneal sing,And to a lovelier BelleThan fiction e'er devis'd, or eloquence can tell,Your vocal tributes bring.And you, ye winged choristers, that flyIn all the pensile gardens of the sky,Chant thro' th' enamel'd grove,Stretch from the trembling twigs your little throats,With all the wild variety of artless notes,But let each note be love.Fragrant Flora, queen of May,All bedight with garlands gay,Where in the smooth-shaven greenThe spangled cowslips variegate the scene,And the rivulet between,Whispers, murmurs, sings,As it stops, or falls, or springs;There spread a sofa of thy softest flowers,There let the bridegroom stay,There let him hate the light, and curse the day,And dun the tardy hours.II.But see the bride—she comes with silent pace,Full of majesty and love;Not with a nobler graceLook'd the imperial wife of Jove,When erst ineffably she shoneIn Venus' irresistible, inchanting zone.Phoebus, great god of verse, the nymph observe,Observe her well;Then touch each sweetly-trem'lous nerveOf thy resounding shell:Her like huntress-Dian paint,Modest, but without restraint;From Pallas take her decent pace,With Venus sweeten all her face,From the Zephyrs steal her sighs,From thyself her sun-bright eyes;Then baffled, thou shalt see,That as did Daphne thee,Her charms thy genius' force shall fly,And by no soft persuasive sounds be brib'dTo come within INVENTION'S narrow eye;But all indignant shun its grasp, and scorn to be describ'd.III.Now see the bridegroom rise,Oh! how impatient are his joys!Bring me zephyrs to depaint his voice,But light'ning for his eyes.
He leaps, he springs, he flies into her arms,With joy intense,Feeds ev'ry sense,And sultanates o'er all her charms.Oh! had I Virgil's comprehensive strain,Or sung like Pope, without a word in vain,Then should I hope my numbers might contain,Egregious nymph, thy boundless happiness,How arduous to express!Such may it last to all eternity:And may thy Lord with thee,Like two coeval pines in Ida's grove,That interweave their verdant arms in love,Each mutual office chearfully perform,And share alike the sunshine, and the storm;And ever, as you flourish hand in hand,Both shade the shepherd and adorn the land,Together with each growing year arise,Indissolubly link'd, and climb at last the skies.To ETHELINDA, On her doing my Verses the honour of wearing them in her bosom.

Has plac'd thee in this servile cell,Where Discipline and Dulness dwell,Where Genius ne'er was seen to roam;Where ev'ry selfish soul's at rest,Nor ever quits the carnal breast,But lurks and sneaks at home!III.Tho' dim'd thine eye, and clipt thy wing,So grov'ling! once so great!The grief-inspired Muse shall singIn tend'rest lays thy fate.What time by thee scholastic PrideTakes his precise, pedantic stride,Nor on thy mis'ry casts a care,The stream of love ne'er from his heartFlows out, to act fair pity's part;But stinks, and stagnates there.IV.Yet useful still, hold to the throng—Hold the reflecting glass,—That not untutor'd at thy wrongThe passenger may pass:Thou type of wit and fense confin'd,Cramp'd by the oppressors of the mind,Who study downward on the ground;Type of the fall of Greece and Rome;While more than mathematic gloom,Envelopes all around!DE ARTE CRITICA. A LATIN VERSION OF Mr. POPE's Essay on CRITICISM.Nec me animi fallit—Difficile illustrare Latinis versibus esse(Multa novis verbis praesertim cum sit agendum)Propter egestatem linguae, & rerum novitatem. LUCRET.AN ESSAY on CRITICISM.'TIS hard to say, if greater want of skillAppear in writing, or in judging ill;But of the two, less dang'rous is th' offenceTo tire our patience, than mislead our sense.Some few in that, but numbers err in this,Ten censure wrong, for one who writes amiss.A fool might once himself alone expose,Now one in verse makes many more in prose.'Tis with our judgments as our watches, noneGo just alike, yet each believes his own.In poets as true genius is but rare,True taste as seldom is the critic's share;Both must alike from heav'n derive their light,These born to judge, as well as those to write.Qui scribit artificiose. ab aliis commode scripta facile intelligere poterit. CIC. ad Herenn. b. 4. Let such teach others who themselves excel,And censure freely who have written well.
Authors are partial to their wit, 'tis true;But are not criticks to their judgment too?Yet if we look more closely, we shall find,Omnes tacito quodam sensu, sine ullâ arte, aut ratione, quae fint in artibus ac rationibus recta ac prava dijudicant. Cic. de Orat. lib. 3. Most have the seeds of judgment in their mind:Nature affords at least a glimm'ring light;The lines, tho' touch'd but faintly, are drawn right.But as the slightest-sketch, if justly trac'd,Is by ill-colouring but the more disgrac'd,So by false learning is good sense defac'd.Some are bewilder'd in the maze of schools,And some made coxcombs, nature meant but fools.In search of wit, those lose their common sense,And then turn criticks in their own defence.Each burns alike, who can, or cannot write,Or with a rival's, or an eunuch's spite.All fools have still an itching to deride,And fain wou'd be upon the laughing side:If Maevius scribble in Apollo's spight,There are, who judge still worse than he can write.Some have at first for wits, then poets past,Turn'd criticks next, and prov'd plain fools at last.Some neither can for wits or criticks pass,As heavy mules are neither horse, nor ass.
Those half-learn'd witlings num'rous in our isle,As half-form'd insects on the banks of Nile,Unfinish'd things one knows not what to call,Their generation's so equivocal:To tell 'em, wou'd a hundred tongues require,Or one vain wit's, that might a hundred tire.But you who seek to give and merit Fame,And justly bear a critick's noble name,Be sure yourself and your own reach to know,How far your genius, taste, and learning go.Launch not beyond your depth, but be discreet,And mark that point where sense and dulness meet.Nature to all things fix'd the limits fit,And wisely curb'd proud man's pretending wit.As on the land while here the ocean gains,In other parts it leaves wide sandy plains.Thus in the soul, while memory prevails,The solid pow'r of understanding fails;Where beams of warm imagination play,The memory's soft figures melt away.One science only will one genius fit;So vast is art, so narrow human wit:Not only bounded to peculiar arts,But oft in those confin'd to single parts.Like kings, we lose the conquests gain'd before,By vain ambition still to make them more.
Each might his several province well command,Would all but stoop to what they understand.First follow Nature, and your judgment frameBy her just standard, which is still the same.Unerring Nature, still divinely bright,One clear, unchang'd, and universal light,Life, force, and beauty must to all impart,At once the source, and end, and test of art.Art from that fund each just supply provides,Works without show, and without pomp presides:In some fair body thus th' informing soulWith spirits feeds, with vigour fills the whole,Each motion guides, and ev'ry nerve sustains;Itself unseen, but in th' effect, remains.There are whom heav'n has blest with store of wit,Yet want as much again to manage it;For wit and judgment ever are at strife,Tho' meant each other's aid, like man and wife.'Tis more to guide, than spur, the Muse's steed;Restrain his fury, than provoke his speed;The winged courser, like a gen'rous horse,Shows most true Mettle when you check his course.Those rules of old discover'd, not devis'd,Are Nature still, but Nature methodiz'd:
Nature, like monarchy, is but restrain'dBy the same laws, which first herself ordain'd.Hear how learn'd Greece her useful rules indites,When to suppress, and when indulge our flights!High on Parnassus' top her sons she show'd,And pointed out those arduous paths they trod,Held from afar, aloft, th' immortal prize,And urg'd the rest by equal steps to rise.Just Nec enim artibus editis factum est ut argumenta inveniremus, sed dicta sunt omnia antequam preciperentur, mox ea scriptores observata & collecta ediderunt. QUINTIL. precepts thus from great examples giv'n,She drew from them what they deriv'd from heav'n.The generous critic fann'd the poet's fire,And taught the world with reason to admire.Then Criticism the Muse's handmaid prov'd,To dress her charms, and make her more belov'd:But following wits from that intention stray'd:Who could not win the mistress woo'd the maid:Against the poets their own arms they turn'd,Sure to hate most the men from whom they learn'd.So modern 'pothecaries taught the art,By doctor's bills to play the doctor's part,Bold in the practice of mistaken rules,Prescribe, apply, and call their masters fools.Some on the leaves of ancient authors prey,Nor time, nor moths e'er spoil'd so much as they.
Some dryly plain, without invention's aid,Write dull receipts how poems should be made.These lose the sense their learning to display,And those explain the meaning quite away.You then whose judgment the right course wou'd steer,Know well each Ancient's proper character,His fable, subject, scope of ev'ry page,Religion, country, genius of his age:Without all these at once before your eyes,Cavil you may, but never criticizeBe Homer's works your study and delight,Read him by day and meditate by night.Thence form your judgment, thence your notions bring,And trace the Muses upward to their spring.Still with itself compar'd, his text peruse;Or let your comment be the Mantuan muse.Cum canerem Reges & Praelia, Cynthius aurem vellit—VIRG. Ecl. 6. When first young Maro sung of kings and wars,Ere warning Phoebus touch'd his trembling ears,Perhaps he seem'd above the critic's law,And but from nature's fountains scorn'd to draw;But when t'examine every part he came,Nature and Homer were, he found, the same;Convinc'd, amaz'd, he checks the bold design,And rules as strict his labour'd work confine,As if the Stagyrite o'erlook'd each line.
Learn hence for ancient rules a just esteem,To copy nature, is to copy them.Some beauties yet, no precepts can declare,For there's a happiness as well as care.Music resembles poetry, in eachAre nameless graces which no methods teach,And which a master-hand alone can reach.Neque tam sancta sunt ista praecepta, sed hoc quicquid est, utilitas excogitavit; non negabo autem sic utile est plerumque; verum si eadem illa nobis aliud suadebit utilitas, hanc, relictis magistrorum autoritatibus, sequemur. QUINT. lib. 2. cap. 13. If where the rules not far enough extend,(Since rules were made but to promote their end)Some lucky licence answers to the fullTh' intent propos'd, that licence is a rule.Thus Pegasus a nearer way to take,May boldly deviate from the common track.Great wits sometimes may gloriously offend,And rise to faults true criticks dare not mend;From vulgar bounds with brave disorder part,And snatch a grace beyond the reach of art,Which, without passing thro' the judgment, gainsThe heart, and all its end at once attainsIn prospects thus some objects please our eyes,Which out of nature's common order rise,The shapeless rock, or hanging precipice.But care in poetry must still be had,It asks discretion ev'n in running mad:
And tho' the antients thus their rules invade,(As kings dispense with laws themselves have made)Moderns beware! or if you must offendAgainst the precept, ne'er transgress its end.Let it be seldom, and compell'd by need,And have, at least, their precedent to plead.The critic else proceeds without remorse,Seizes your fame, and puts his laws in force.I know there are, to whose presumptuous thoughtsThose freer beauties, even in them, seem faults.Some figures monstrous, and miss-shap'd appear,Consider'd singly, or beheld too near,Which, but proportion'd to their light, or place,Due distance reconciles to form and grace.A prudent chief not always must displayHis pow'rs in equal ranks, and fair array;But with th' occasion, and the place comply,Conceal his force, nay, sometimes seem to fly.Those oft are stratagems which errors seem,Nor is it Homer nods, but we that dream.Still green with bays each ancient altar stands,Above the reach of sacrilegious hands;Secure from flames, from envy's fiercer rage,Destructive war, and all-devouring age.See, from each clime the learn'd their incense bring;Hear in all tongues consenting paeans ring!
In praise so just let ev'ry voice be join'd,And fill the general chorus of mankind!Hail, bards triumphant! born in happier days,Immortal heirs of universal praise!Whose honours with increase of ages grow,As streams roll down enlarging as they flow!Nations unborn your mighty names shall sound,And worlds applaud that must not yet be found!Oh! may some spark of your celestial fireThe last, the meanest of your sons inspire,(That on weak wings from far pursues your flights,Glows while he reads, but trembles as he writes)To teach vain wits a science little known,T'admire superior sense and doubt their own.Of all the causes which conspire to blindMan's erring judgment, and misguide the mind;What the weak head with strongest bias rules,Is pride, the never-failing vice of fools.Whatever nature has in worth deny'd,She gives, in large recruits of needful pride;For as in bodies, thus in souls we find,What wants in blood and spirits, swell'd with wind:Pride, where wit fails, steps in to our defence,And fills up all the mighty void of sense!If once right reason drives that cloud away,Truth breaks upon us with resistless day;
Trust not yourself by your defects to know,Make use of ev'ry friend—and ev'ry foe.A little learning is a dang'rous thing,Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring;There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain,And drinking largely sobers us again.Fir'd at first sight with what the muse imparts,In fearless youth we tempt the heights of arts,While from the bounded level of our mind,Short views we take, nor see the lengths behind;But more advanc'd, behold with strange surprizeNew distant scenes of endless science rise!So pleas'd at first the tow'ring Alps we try,Mount o'er the vales, and seem to tread the sky,Th' eternal snows appear already past,And the first clouds and mountains seem the last;But those attain'd, we tremble to surveyThe growing labour of the lengthen'd way,Th' increasing prospect tires our wond'ring eyes,Hills peep o'er hills, and Alps on Alps arise!Diligenter legendum est, ac pene ad scribendi sollicitudinem; nec per partes modo scrutanda sunt omnia; sed perlectus liber utique ex integro refumendus. QUINTIL. A perfect judge will read each work of witWith the same spirit that its author writ,
Survey the whole, nor seek slight faults to find,Where nature moves, and rapture warms the mind;Nor lose, for that malignant, dull delight,The gen'rous pleasure to be charm'd with wit:But in such lays as neither ebb nor flow,Correctly cold, and regularly low,That shunning faults, one quiet temper keep,We cannot blame indeed—but we may sleep▪In wit, as nature, what affects our heartsIs not th' exactness of peculiar parts:'Tis not a lip, nor eye, we beauty call,But the joint force, and full result of all.Thus when we view some well-proportion'd dome,(The world's just wonderd, and ev'n thine, O Rome!)No single parts unequally surprize,All comes united to the admiring eyes;No monstrous height, or breadth, or length appear;The whole at once is bold and regular.Whoever thinks a faultless piece to see,Thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er shall be.In ev'ry work regard the writer's end,Since none can compass more than they intend;And if the means be just, the conduct true,Applause, in spight of trivials faults, is due.As men of breeding, sometimes men of wit,T'avoid great errors, must the less commit.
Neglect the rules each verbal critic lays,For not to know some trifles is a praise.Most critics fond of some subservient art,Still make the whole depend upon a part,They talk of principles, but notions prize,And all to one lov'd folly sacrifice.Once, on a time, la Mancha's knight, they say,A certain bard encount'ring on the way,Discours'd in terms as just, in looks as sage,As e'er cou'd Dennis, of the Grecian stage;Concluding all were desp'rate sots, and fools,That durst depart from Aristotle's rules.Our author happy in a judge so nice,Produc'd his play, and begg'd the knight's advice;Made him observe the subject, and the plot,The manners, passions, unities, what not?All which, exact to rule, were brought about,Were but a combat in the lists left out"What! leave the combat out?" exclaims the knight;Yes, or we must renounce the Stagyrite."Not so, by heav'n! (he answers in a rage)"Knights, squires, and steeds, must enter on the stage."The stage can ne'er so vast a throng contain."Then build a-new, or act it on a plain."Thus critics of less judgment than caprice,Curious, not knowing, not exact, but nice,
Form short ideas, and offend in arts(As most in manners) by a love to parts.Some to conceit alone their taste confine,And glitt'ring thoughts struck out at ev'ry line;Pleas'd with a work, where nothing's just or fit,One glaring chaos, and wild heap of wit.Poets like painters, thus unskill'd to traceThe naked nature, and the living grace,With gold and jewels cover ev'ry part,And hide with ornaments their want of art.True Naturam intueamur, hanc sequamur; id facillime accipiunt animi quod agnoscunt. QUINTIL. lib. 8. cap. 3. wit is nature to advantage dress'd,What oft was thought, but ne'er so well express'd;Something, whose truth convinc'd at sight, we find,That gives us back the image of our mind.As shades more sweetly recommend the light,So modest plainness sets off sprightly wit:For works may have more wit than does them good,As bodies perish through excess of blood.Others, for language all their care express,And value books, as women men, for dress:Their praise is still—the style is excellent;The sense they humbly take upon content.
Words are like leaves, and where they most abound,Much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found.False eloquence, like the prismatic glass,Its gaudy colours spreads on ev'ry place;The face of nature we no more survey,All glares alike, without distinction gay;But true expression, like th' unchanging sun;Clears and improves whate'er it shines upon,It gilds all objects but it alters none.Expression is the dress of thought, and stillAppears more decent, as more suitable;A vile conceit in pompous words express'd,Is like a clown in regal purple dress'd;For diff'rent styles with diff'rent subjects sort,As sev'ral garbs, with country, town, and court.Some Abolita et abrogata retinere, insolentiae cujusdam est, et frivolae in parvis jactantiae. QUINTIL. lib. 1. cap. 6.Opus est ut verba a vetustate repetita neque creba sint, neque manifesta; quia nil est odiosus affectatione, nec utique ab ultimis repetita temporibus. Oratio, cujus summa virtus est perspicuitas; quam sit vitiosa, si egeat interprete? Ergo ut novorum optima erunt maxime vetera, ita veterum maxime nova. Ibidem. by old words to fame have made pretence,Ancients in phrase, meer moderns in their sense!Such labour'd nothings in so strange a style,Amaze the unlearn'd, and make the learned smile.Unlucky, as Fungoso in the Ben Johnson's Every Man in his humour. play;These sparks with aukward vanity displayWhat the fine gentleman wore yesterday.
And but so mimic ancient wits at best,As apes our grandsires in their doublets drest.In words, as fashions, the same rule will hold;Alike fantastic, if too new, or old;Be not the first by whom the new are try'd,Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.Quis populi sermo est? quis enim? nisi carmine molliNunc demum numero fluere ut per laeve severosEffugit junctura ungues; scit tendere versum,Nec secus ac si oculo rubricam dirigat uno. PERSIUS. Stat. 1. But most by numbers judge a poet's song,And smoth, or rough, with them, is right or wrong;In the bright muse tho' thousand charms conspire,Her voice is all these tuneful fools admire;Who haunt Parnassus but to please the ear,Not mend their minds, as some to church repair,Not for the doctrine, but the music there.These equal syllables alone require,Tho' Fugiemus crebras vocalium concursiones, quae vastam atque hiantem orationem reddunt. Cic. ad Herenn. lib. 4. oft the ear the open vowels tire;While expletives their feeble aid do join,And ten low words oft creep in one dull line;While they ring round the same unvary'd chimes,With sure returns of still-expected rhymes.Where'er you find, the cooling western breeze,In the next line, it whispers thro' the trees,
If crystal streams, with pleasing murmurs creep,The reader's threat'ned, not in vain, with sleep.Then at the last, and only couplet fraughtWith some unmeaning thing they call a thought,A needless Alexandrine ends the song,That like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along.Leave such to tune their own dull rhymes, and knowWhat's roundly smooth, or languishingly slow,And praise the easy vigour of a lineWhere Denham's strength, and Waller's sweetness join.True ease in writing comes from art not chance,As those move easiest who have learn'd to dance.'Tis not enough no harshness gives offence,The sound must seem an echo to the sense.Soft is the strain when Zephyr gently blows,And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows,But when loud billows lash the sounding shore,The hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar.When Ajax strives, some rock's vast weight to throw,The line too labours, and the words move slow,Not so, when swift Camilla scours the plain,Flies o'er th' unbending corn, and skims along the main.Hear how Alexander's feast, or the power of music; an ode by Mr. Dryden. Timotheus various lays surprize,And bid alternate passions fall and rise!
While at each change the son of Lybian Jove,Now burns with glory, and then melts with love;Now fierce his eyes with sparkling fury glow!Now sighs steal out, and tears begin to flow;Persians and Greeks like turns of nature found,And the world's victor stood subdu'd by sound!The pow'r of music all our hearts allow,And what Timotheus was, is Dryden now.Avoid extremes, and shun the fault of such,Who still are pleas'd too little, or too much.At ev'ry trifle scorn to take offence,That always shows great pride, or little sense.Those heads, as stomachs, are not sure the best,Which nauseate all, and nothing can digest.Yet let not each gay turn thy rapture move;For fools admire, but men of sense approve.As things seem large which we thro' mists descry,Dulness is ever apt to magnify.Some the French writers, some our own despise;The ancients only, or the moderns prize.(Thus wit, like faith, by each man is apply'dTo one small sect, and all are damn'd beside,)
Meanly they seek the blessing to confine,And force that sun but on a part to shine,Which not alone the southern wit sublimes,But ripens spirits in cold northern climes,Which from the first has shone on ages past,Enlights the present, and shall warm the last.(Tho' each may feel increases and decays,And see now clearer and now darker days)Regard not then if wit be old or new,But blame the false and value still the true.Some ne'er advance a judgment of their own,But catch the speading notion of the town;They reason and conclude by precedent,And own stale nonsense, which they ne'er invent.Some judge of authors names, not works, and thenNor praise, nor blame the writings, but the men.Of all this servile herd, the worst is heWho in proud dulness joins with quality,A constant critic at the great man's board,To fetch and carry nonsense for my lord.Wht woful stuff this madrigal wou'd be,In some starved hackney sonneteer, or me?But let a lord once own the happy lines,How the wit brightens, how the style refines!
Before his sacred name flies ev'ry fault,And each exalted stanza steems with thought!The vulgar thus thro' imitation err,As oft the learn'd by being singular;So much they scorn the croud, that if the throngBy chance go right, they purposely go wrong:So schismatics the plain believers quit,And are but damn'd for having too much wit.Some blame at morning what they praise at night;But always think the last opinion right.A muse by these is like a mistress us'd,This hour she's idoliz'd, the next abus'd;While their weak heads like towns unfortify'd,'Twixt sense and nonsense daily change their side.Ask them the cause, they're wiser still they say;And still to-morrow's wiser than to-day.We think our fathers fools, so wise we grow;Our wiser sons, no doubt, will think us so.Once school-divines this zealous isle oe'erspread;Who knew most sentences, was deepest read;
Faith, gospel, all, seem'd made to be disputed,And none had sense enough to be confuted:Scotists and Thomists, now in peace remain,Amidst their kindred cobwebs in Duck-lane.If faith itself has diff'rent dresses worn,What wonder modes in wit shou'd take their turn?Oft leaving what is natural and fit,The current folly proves the ready wit;And authors think their reputation safe,Which lives as long as fools are pleas'd to laugh.Some valuing those of their own side or mind,Still make themselves the measure of mankind;Fondly we think we honour merit then,When we but praise ourselves in other men.Parties in wit attend on those of state,And public faction doubles private hate.Pride, malice, folly, against Dryden rose,In various shapes of parsons, critics, beaus;But sense surviv'd when merry jests were past;For rising merit will buoy up at last.Might he return and bless once more our eyes,New Blackmores and new Milbournes must arise;Nay, shou'd great Homer lift his awful head,Zoilus again wou'd start up from the dead.
Envy will merit, as its shade pursue,But like a shadow proves the substance true;For envy'd wit, like Sol eclips'd, makes knownTh' opposing body's grossness, not its own.When first the sun too pow'rful beams displays,It draws up vapours which obscure the rays;But ev'n those clouds at last adorn its way,Reflect new glories and augment the day.Be thou the first true merit to befriend,His praise is lost who stays till all commend.Short is the date, alas! of modern rhymes,And 'tis but just to let them live betimes.No longer now that golden age appears,When patriarch-wits surviv'd a thousand years;Now length of fame (our second life) is lost,And bare threescore, is all ev'n that can boast;Our sons their fathers failing language see,And such as Chaucer is, shall Dryden be.So when the faithful pencil has design'dSome bright idea of the master's mind,Where a new world leaps out at his command,And ready nature waits upon his hand;
When the ripe colours soften and unite,And sweetly melt into just shade and light,When mellowing years their full perfection give,And each bold figure just begins to live,The treach'rous colours the fair art betray,And all the bright creation fades away.Unhappy wit, like most mistaken things,Attones not for the envy which it brings.In youth alone its empty praise we boast,But soon the short-liv'd vanity is lost!Like some fair flow'r the early spring supplies,That gaily blooms, but ev'n in blooming dies.What is this wit which most our cares employ?The owner's wife, that other men enjoy;Still most our trouble, when the most admir'd;The more we give, the more is still requir'd:The fame with pains we gain, but lose with ease,Sure some to vex, but never all to please;'Tis what the vicious fear; the virtuous shun,By fools 'tis hated, and by knaves undone!If wit so much from ign'rance undergo,Ah, let not learning too commence its foe!Of old, those met rewards who cou'd excel,And such were prais'd, who but endeavour'd well;Tho' triumphs were to gen'rals only due,Crowns were reserv'd to grace the soldier too.Now they who reach Parnassus lofty crown,Employ their pains to spurn some others down;And while self-love each jealous writer rules,Contending wits become the sport of fools.But still the worst with most regret commend,For each ill author is as bad a friend.To what base end, and by what abject ways,Are mortals urg'd thro' sacred lust of praise!Ah, ne'er so dire a thirst of glory boast,Nor in the critic let the man be lost:Good-nature, and good-sense must ever join;To err is human, to forgive divine.But if in noble minds some dregs remain,Not yet purg'd off, of spleen and sour disdain;Discharge that rage on more provoking crimes,Nor fear a dearth in these flagitious times.No pardon vile obscenity shou'd find,Tho' wit and art conspire to move your mind:
But dulness with obscenity must prove,As shameful sure as impotence in love.In the fat age of pleasure, wealth and ease,Sprung the rank weed, and thriv'd with large increase;When love was all an easy monarch's care,Seldom at a council, never in a war:Jilts rul'd the state, and statesmen farces writ;Nay wits had pensions, and young lords had wit:The fair sate panting at a courtier's play,And not a mask went unimprov'd away:The modest fan was lifted up no more,And virgins smil'd at what they blush'd before—The following licence of a foreign reignDid all the dregs of bold Socinus drain;Then unbelieving priests reform'd the nation,And taught more pleasant methods of salvation;Where heaven's free subjects might their rights dispute,Lest God himself should seem too absolute.Pulpits their sacred satire learn'd to spare,And vice admir'd to find a flatt'rer there!Encourag'd thus, wit's Titans brav'd the skies,And the press groan'd with licenc'd blasphemies—
These monsters, critics, with your darts engage,Here point your thunder, and exhaust your rage!Yet shun their fault, who scandalously nice,Will needs mistake an author into vice;All seems infected that th' infected spy,As all looks yellow to the jaundic'd eye.Learn then what morals critics ought to show,For 'tis but half a judge's task to know.'Tis not enough wit, art, and learning join;In all you speak, let truth and candour shine:That not alone what to your judgment's dueAll may allow; but seek your friendship too.Be silent always when you doubt your sense;And speak, tho' sure, with seeming diffidence;Some positive, persisting fops we know,That if once wrong, will needs be always so;But you with pleasure own your errors past,And make each day, a critic on the last.'Tis not enough your counsel still be true,Blunt truths more mischief than nice falshoods do;Men must be taught as if you taught 'em not,And things unknown propos'd as things forgot.
Without good-breeding, truth is disapprov'd;That only makes superior sense belov'd.Be niggards of advice on no pretence;For the worst avarice is that of sense.With mean complacence ne'er betray your trust,Nor be so civil as to prove unjust;Fear most the anger of the wise to raise,Those best can bear reproof who merit praise.'Twere well, might critics still this freedom take,But Appius reddens at each word you speak,And stares, tremendous with a threat'ning eye,Like some fierce tyrant in old tapestry!Fear most to tax an honourable fool,Whose right it is uncensur'd to be dull;Such without wit are poets when they please,As without learning they can take degrees.Leave dang'rous truths to unsuccessful satyrs,And flattery to fulsome dedicators,Whom, when they praise, the world believes no more,Than when they promise to give scribbling o'er.'Tis best sometimes your censure to restrainAnd charitably let the dull be vain.
Your silence there is better than your spite,For who can rail so long as they can write?Still humming on their drowsy course they keep,And lash'd so long, like tops, are lash'd asleep.False steps but help them to renew the race,As after stumbling, jades will mend their pace:What crouds of these, impertinently bold,In sounds, and jing'ling syllables grown old,Still run on poets in a raging vein,Ev'n to the dregs, and squeezings of the brain:Strain out the last dull droppings of their sense,And rhyme with all the rage of impotence.Such shameless bards we have, and yet 'tis true,There are as mad abandon'd critics too.The book-full blockhead, ignorantly read,With loads of learned lumber in his head,With his own tongue, still edifies his ears,And always listning to himself appears—All books he reads, and all he reads assailsFrom Dryden's fables, down to Durfy's tales.With him most authors steal their works, or buy;Garth did not write his own dispensary.Name a new play, and he's the poet's friend,Nay, show'd his faults—but when wou'd poets mend?
No place so sacred from such fops is barr'd,Nor is Paul's-church more safe than Paul's-church-yard;Nay fly to altars; there he'll talk you dead;For fools rush in where angels fear to tread.Distrustful sense with modest caution speaks,It still looks home, and short excursions makes,But rattling nonsense in full vollies breaks,And never shock'd, and never turn'd aside,Bursts out, resistless, with a thund'ring tide!But where's the man, who counsel can bestow,Still pleas'd to teach, and yet not proud to know?Unbias'd, or by favour, or by spite;Not dully prepossess'd, or blindly right,Tho' learn'd, well-bred; and tho' well-bred, sincere,Modestly bold, and humanely severe?Who to a friend his faults can freely show,And gladly praise the merit of a foe?Blest with a taste exact and unconfin'd;A knowledge both of books and human kind;Gen'rous converse; a soul exempt from pride,And love to praise, with reason on his side?Such once were critics; such the happy few,Athens and Rome in better ages knew.The mighty Stagyrite first left the shore,Spread all his sails, and durst the deep explore;
He steer'd securely, and discover'd far,Led by the light of the Maeonian star.Poets, a race long unconfin'd and free,Still fond and proud of savage liberty,Receiv'd his laws, and stood convinc'd 'twas fit,Who conquer'd nature, should preside o'er wit.Horace still charms with graceful negligence,And without method talks us into sense,Will like a friend, familiarly conveyThe truest notions in the easiest way;He, who supreme in judgment, as in wit,Might boldly censure, as he boldly writ;Yet judg'd with coolness, tho' he sung with fire,His precepts teach but what his works inspire.Our critics take a contrary extremeThey judge with fury, but they write with phlegm;Nor suffers Horace more in wrong translationsBy wits, than critics in as wrong quotations.See Dionysius Dionysius of Halicarnassus. Homer's thoughts refine,And call new beauties forth from ev'ry line.Fancy and art in gay Petronius please,The scholar's learning, with the courtier's ease.In grave Quintilian's copious work we findThe justest rules, and clearest method join'd;
Thus useful arms in magazines we place,All rang'd in order, and dispos'd with grace.Nor thus alone the curious eye to please,But to be found when need requires with ease.Thee, bold Longinus! all the Nine inspire,And bless their critic with a poet's fire;An ardent judge, who zealous in his trustWith warmth gives sentence, yet is always just;Whose own example strengthens all his laws,And is himself that great sublime he draws.Thus long succeeding critics justly reign'dLicence repress'd, and useful laws ordain'd.Learning and Rome alike in empire grew,And arts still follow'd where her eagles flew;From the same foes, at last, both felt their doom,And the same age saw learning fall and Rome.With tyranny, then superstition join'd,As that the body, this enslav'd the mind;Much was believ'd, but little understood,And to be dull was constru'd to be good;A second deluge learning thus o'er-run,And the Monks finish'd what the Goths begun.At length Erasmus, that great injur'd name,(The glory of the priest-hood, and the shame)
Stemn'd the wild torrent of a barb'rous age,And drove those holy Vandals off the stage.But see each muse in Leo's golden days,Starts from her trance, and trims her wither'd bays!Rome's ancient genius, o'er its ruins spread,Shakes off the dust, and rears his rev'rend head!Then Sculpture and her sister arts revive,Stones leap'd to form, and rocks began to live;With sweeter notes each rising temple rung;A Raphael painted, and a Hieronymus Vida, an excellent Latin poet, who writ an art of poetry in verse. He flourish'd in the time of Leo the tenth. Vida sung!Immortal Vida! on whose honour'd browThe poets bays, and critics ivy grow:Cremona now shall ever boast thy name,As next in place to Mantua, next in fame!But soon by impious arms from Latium chac'd,Their ancient bounds the banish'd muses past;Thence arts o'er all the northern world advance;But critic learning flourish'd most in France:The rules, a nation born to serve obeys;And Boileau still in right of Horace sways;But we, brave Britons, foreign laws despis'd,And kept unconquer'd, and unciviliz'd,
Fierce for the liberties of wit, and bold,We still desy'd the Romans, as of old.Yet some there were among the founder fewOf those who less presum'd, and better knew,Who durst assert the juster ancient cause,And here restor'd wit's fundamental laws.Such was the muse, whose rules and practice tell,Nature's Essay on poetry, by the duke of Buckingham. chief master-piece is writing well.Such was Roscommon—not more learn'd than good,With manners gen'rous as his noble blood;To him the wit of Greece and Rome was known,And ev'ry author's merit but his own.Such late was Walsh—the muse's judge and friend;Who justly knew to blame, or to commend;To failings mild, but zealous for desert;The clearest head, and the sincerest heart.This humble praise, lamented shade! receive,This praise at least a grateful muse may give!The muse, whose early voice you taught to sing,Prescrib'd her heights, and prun'd her tender wing;(Her guide now lost) no more pretends to rise,But in low numbers short excursions tries;Content, if hence th' unlearn'd their wants may view,The learn'd reflect on what before they knew:
Careless of censure, nor too fond of fame,Still pleas'd to praise, yet not afraid to blame:Averse alike to flatter or offend,Not free from faults, nor yet too vain to mend.DE ARTE CRITICA.DICTU difficile est, an sit dementia majorEgisse invitâ vatem criticumne Minervâ;Ille tamen certe venia tibi dignior erratQui lassat, quam qui seducit in avia, sensus.Sunt, qui absurda canunt; sed enim stultissima stultosQuam longe exuperat oriticorum natio vates;Se solum exhibuit quondam, melioribus annisNatus hebes, ridendum; at nunc musa improba prolemInnumeram gignit, quae mox sermone solutoAequiparet stolidos versus, certetque stupendo.Nobis judicium, veluti quae dividit horasMachina, construitur, motus non omnibus idem,Non pretium, regit usque tamen sua quemque.

BOOK the FIRST.THE land that answers best the farmer's care,And silvers to maturity the Hop:When to inhume the plants; to turn the glebe;And wed the tendrils to th' aspiring poles:Under what sign to pluck the crop, and howTo cure, and in capacious sacks infold,I teach in verse Miltonian. Smile the muse,And meditate an honour to that landWhere first I breath'd, and struggled into lifeImpatient, Cantium, to be call'd thy son.Oh! cou'd I emulate Dan Sydney's muse,Thy Sydney, Cantium—He from court retir'dIn Penshurst's sweet elysium sung delight,Sung transport to the soft-responding streamsOf Medway, and enliven'd all her groves:
While ever near him, goddess of the green,Fair Sister to Sir Philip Sydney. Pembroke sat, and smil'd immense applause.With vocal fascination charm'd the —HOM. E. HoursUnguarded left Heav'ns adamantine gate,And to his lyre, swift as the winged soundsThat skim the air, danc'd unperceiv'd away.Had I such pow'r, no peasants toil, no hopsShou'd e'er debase my lay: far nobler themes,The high atchievements of thy warrior kingsShou'd raise my thoughts, and dignify my song.But I, young rustic, dare not leave my cot,For so enlarg'd a sphere—ah! muse beware,Lest the loud larums of the braying trump,Lest the deep drum shou'd drown thy tender reed,And mar its puny joints: me, lowly swain,Every unshaven arboret, me the lawns,Me the voluminous Medway's silver wave,Rura mihi, & rigui placeant in vallibus amnes,Flumina amen, sylvasque in glorius! VIRG. GEORG. 2. Content inglorious, and the hopland shades!Yeomen, and countrymen attend my song:Whether you shiver in the marshy Commonly, but improperly call'd, the Wild. Weald,Egregious shepherds of unnumber'd flocks,Whose fleeces, poison'd into purple, deck
All Europe's kings: or in fair Maidstone. Madum's valeImparadis'd, blest denizons, ye dwell;Or Canterbury. Dorovernia's awful tow'rs ye love:Or plough Tunbridgia's salutiferous hillsIndustrious, and with draughts chalybiate heal'd,Confess divine Hygeia's blissful seat;The muse demands your presence, ere she tuneHer monitory voice; observe her well,And catch the wholesome dictates as they fall.'Midst thy paternal acres, Farmer, sayHas gracious heav'n bestow'd one field, that basksIts loamy bosom in the mid-day sun,Emerging gently from the abject vale,Nor yet obnoxious to the wind, secureThere shall thou plant thy hop. This soil, perhaps,Thou'lt say, will fill my garners. Be it so.But Ceres, rural goddess, at the bestMeanly supports her vot'ry', enough for her,If ill-persuading hunger she repell,And keep the soul from fainting: to enlarge,To glad the heart, to sublimate the mind,And wing the flagging spirits to the sky,Require th' united influence and aidOf Bacchus, God of hops, with Ceres join'd
'Tis he shall gen'rate the buxom beer.Then on one pedestal, and hand in hand,Sculptur'd in Parian stone (so gratitudeIndites) let the divine co-part'ners rise.Stands eastward in thy field a wood? 'tis well.Esteem it as a bulwark of thy wealth,And cherish all its branches; tho' we'll grant,Its leaves umbrageous may interceptThe morning rays, and envy some small shareOf Sol's beneficence to the infant germ.Yet grutch not that: when whistling Eurus comes,With all his worlds of insects in thy landsTo hyemate, and monarchize o'er allThy vegetable riches, then thy woodShall ope it's arms expansive, and embraceThe storm reluctant, and divert its rage.Armies of animalc'les urge their wayIn vain: the ventilating trees opposeTheir airy march. They blacken distant plains.This site for thy young nursery obtain'd,Thou hast begun auspicious, if the soil(As sung before) be loamy; this the hopLoves above others, this is rich, is deep,Is viscous, and tenacious of the pole.Yet maugre all its native worth, it mayBe meliorated with warm compost. See!Boxley-Hill, which extends through great part of Kent. Yon craggy mountain, whose fastidious head,Divides the star-set hemisphere above,And Cantium's plains beneath; the AppennineOf a free Italy, whose chalky sidesWith verdant shrubs dissimilarly gay,Still captivate the eye, while at his feetThe silver Medway glides, and in her breastViews the reflected landskip, charm'd she viewsAnd murmurs louder ectasy below.Here let us rest awhile, pleas'd to beholdTh' all-beautiful horizon's wide expanse,Far as the eagle's ken. Here tow'ring spiresFirst catch the eye, and turn the thoughts to heav'n.The lofty elms in humble majestyBend with the breeze to shade the solemn groves,And spread an holy darkness; Ceres thereShines in her golden vesture. Here the meadsEnrich'd by Flora's daedal hand, with prideExpose their spotted verdure. Nor are youPomona absent; you 'midst th' hoary leavesSwell the vermilion cherry; and on you treesSuspend the pippen's palatable gold.There old Sylvanus in that moss-grown grotDwells with his wood-nymphs: they with chaplets greenAnd russet mantles oft bedight, aloft
From yon bent oaks, in Medway's bosom fairWonder at silver bleak, and prickly pearch,That swiftly thro' their floating forests glide.Yet not even these—these ever-varied scenesOf wealth and pleasure can engage my eyesT' o'erlook the lowly hawthorn, if from thenceThe thrush, sweet warbler, chants th' unstudied laysWhich Phoebus' self vaulting from yonder cloudRefulgent, with enliv'ning ray inspires.But neither tow'ring spires, nor lofty elms,Nor golden Ceres, nor the meadows green,Nor orchats, nor the russet-mantled nymphs,Which to the murmurs of the Medway dance,Nor sweetly warbling thrush, with half those charmsAttract my eyes, as yonder hop-land close,Joint-work of art and nature, which remindsThe muse, and to her theme the wand'rer calls.Here then with pond'rous vehicles and teamsThy rustics send, and from the caverns deepCommand them bring the chalk: thence to the kilnConvey, and temper with Vulcanian fires.Soon as 'tis form'd, thy lime with bounteous handO'er all thy lands disseminate; thy landsWhich first have felt the soft'ning spade, and drankThe strength'ning vapours from nutricious marl.This done, select the choicest hop, t' insertFresh in the opening glebe. Say then, my muse,Its various kinds, and from th' effete and vile,The eligible separate with care.The noblest species is by Kentish wightsThe Master-hop yclep'd. Nature to himHas giv'n a stouter stalk, patient of cold,Or Phoebus ev'n in youth, his verdant bloodIn brisk saltation circulates and flowsIndesinently vigorous: the nextIs arid, fetid, infecund, and grossSignificantly styl'd the Fryar: the lastIs call'd the Savage, who in ev'ry wood,And ev'ry hedge unintroduc'd intrudes.When such the merit of the candidates,Easy is the election; but, my friendWould'st thou ne'er fail, to Kent direct thy way,Where no one shall be frustrated that seeksOught that is great or good.

Hail, Cantium, hail!Illustrious parent of the finest fruits,Illustrious parent of the best of men!For thee Antiquity's thrice sacred springs
Placidly stagnant at their fountain head,I rashly dare to trouble (if from thence,If ought for thy util'ty I can drain)And in thy towns adopt th' Ascraean muse.Hail heroes, hail invaluable gems,Splendidly rough within your native mines,To luxury unrefined, better farTo shake with unbought agues in your weald,Than dwell a slave to passion and to wealth,Politely paralytic in the town!Fav'rites of heav'n! to whom the general doomIs all remitted, who alone possessOf Adam's sons fair Eden—rest ye here,Nor seek an earthly good above the hop;A good! untasted by your ancient kings,And almost to your very sires unknown.In those blest days when great Eliza reign'dO'er the adoring nation, when fair peaceOr spread an unstain'd olive round the land,Or laurell'd war did teach our winged fleetsTo lord it o'er the world, when our brave siresDrank valour from uncauponated beer;Then th' hop (before an interdicted plant,Shun'd like fell aconite) began to hangIts folded floscles from the golden vine,And bloom'd a shade to Cantium's sunny shores
Delightsome, and in chearful goblets laughtPotent, what time Aquarius' urn impendsTo kill the dulsome day—potent to quenchThe Syrian ardour, and autumnal illsTo heal with mild potations; sweeter farThan those which erst the subtile See the following story told at large in Lambarde's perambulation of Kent. Hengist mix'dT' inthral voluptuous Vortigern. He, with loveEmasculate and wine, the toils of war,Neglected, and to dalliance vile and slothEmancipated, saw th' incroaching SaxonsWith unaffected eyes; his hand which oughtT' have shook the spear of justice, soft and smooth,Play'd ravishing divisions on the lyre:This Hengist mark'd, and (for curs'd insolenceSoon fattens on impunity! and becomesBriareus from a dwarf) fair Thanet gain'd.Nor stopt he here; but to immense attemptsAmbition sky-aspiring led him onAdventrous. He an only daughter rear'd,Roxena, matchless maid! nor rear'd in vain.Her eagle-ey'd callidity, grave deceit,And fairy fiction rais'd above her sex,And furnish'd her with thousand various wilesPreposterous, more than female; wondrous fair
She was, and docile, which her pious nurseObserv'd, and early in each female fraudHer 'gan initiate: well she knew to smile,Whene'er vexation gall'd her; did she weep?'Twas not sincere, the fountains of her eyesPlay'd artificial streams, yet so well forc'dThey look'd like nature; for ev'n art to herWas natural, and contrarietiesSeem'd in Roxena congruous and allied.Such was she, when brisk Vortigern beheld,Ill-fated prince! and lov'd her. She perceiv'd,Soon she perceiv'd her conquest; soon she told,With hasty joy transported, her old sire.The Saxon inly smil'd, and to his isleThe willing prince invited, but first badThe nymph prepare the potions; such as fireThe blood's meand'ring rivulets, and depressTo love the soul. Lo! at the noon of nightThrice Hecate invok'd the maid—and thriceThe goddess stoop'd assent; forth from a cloudShe stoop'd, and gave the philters pow'r to charm.These in a splendid cup of burnish'd goldThe lovely sorceress mix'd, and to the princeHealth, peace, and joy propin'd, but to herselfMutter'd dire exorcisms, and wish'd effectTo th' love-creating draught: lowly she bow'dFawning insinuation bland, that might
Deceive Laertes' son; her lucid orbsShed copiously the oblique rays; her faceLike modest Luna's shone, but not so pale,And with no borrow'd lustre; on her browSmil'd Fallacy, while summoning each grace,Kneeling she gave the cup. The prince (for who!Who cou'd have spurn'd a suppliant so divine?)Drank eager, and in ecstasy devour'dTh' ambrosial perturbation; mad with loveHe clasp'd her, and in Hymeneal bandsAt once the nymph demanded and obtain'd.Now Hengist, all his ample wish fulfill'd,Exulted; and from Kent th' uxorious princeExterminated, and usurp'd his seat.Long did he reign; but all-devouring timeHas raz'd his palace walls—Perchance on themGrows the green hop, and o'er his crumbled bustIn spiral twines ascends the scancile pole.—But now to plant, to dig, to dung, to weed;Tasks how indelicate? demand the muse.Come, fair magician, sportive Fancy come,With thy unbounded imagery; child of thought,From thy aeriel citadel descend,And (for thou canst) assist me. Bring with theeThy all-creative Talisman; with theeThe active spirits ideal, tow'ring flights,
That hover o'er the muse-resounding groves,And all thy colourings, all thy shapes display.Thou to be here, Experience, so shall IMy rules nor in low prose jejunely say,Nor in smooth numbers musically err;But vain is Fancy and Experience vain,If thou, O Hesiod! Virgil of our land,Or hear'st thou rather, Milton, bard divine,Whose greatness who shall imitate, save thee?If thou O Mr. John Philips, author of Cyder, a poem. Philips fav'ring dost not hearMe, inexpert of verse; with gentle handUprear the unpinion'd muse, high on the topOf that immeasurable mount, that farExceeds thine own Plinlimmon, where thou tun'stWith Phoebus' self thy lyre. Give me to turnTh' unwieldly subject with thy graceful ease,Extol its baseness with thy art; but chiefIllumine, and invigorate with thy fire.When Phoebus looks thro' Aries on the spring,And vernal flow'rs promise the dulcet fruit,Autumnal pride! delay not then thy settsIn Tellus' facile bosom to deposeTimely: if thou art wise the bulkiest chuse:To every root three joints indulge, and form
The Quincunx with well regulated hills.Soon from the dung-enriched earth, their headsThy young plants will uplift their virgin arms,They'll stretch, and marriageable claim the pole.Nor frustrate thou their wishes, so thou may'stExpect an hopeful issue, jolly Mirth,Sister of taleful Jocus, tuneful Song,And fat Good-nature with her honest face.But yet in the novitiate of their love,And tenderness of youth suffice small shootsCut from the widow'd willow, nor providePoles insurmountable as yet. 'Tis thenWhen twice bright Phoebus' vivifying ray,Twice the cold touch of winter's icy hand,They've felt; 'tis then we fell sublimer props.'Tis then the sturdy woodman's axe from farResounds, resounds, and hark! with hollow groansDown tumble the big trees, and rushing rollO'er the crush'd crackling brake, while in his caveForlorn, dejected, 'midst the weeping dryadsLaments Sylvanus for his verdant care.The ash, or willow for thy use select,Or storm-enduring chesnut; but the oakUnfit for this employ, for nobler endsReserve untouch'd; she when by time matur'd,Capacious, of fome British demi-god,Vernon, or Warren, shall with rapid wing

From great Augustus' ever sacred name!Sovereign of Science! master of the Muse!Neglected Genius' firm ally! Of worthBest judge, and best rewarder, whose applauseTo bards was fame and fortune! O! 'twas well,Well did you too in this, all glorious heroes!Ye Romans!—on Time's wing you've stamp'd his praise,And time shall bear it to eternity.Now are our lab'rours crown'd with their reward,Now bloom the florid hops, and in the streamShine in their floating silver, while aboveT'embow'ring branches culminate, and formA walk impervious to the sun; the polesIn comely order stand; and while you cleaveWith the small skiff the Medway's lucid wave,In comely order still their ranks preserve,And seem to march along th' extensive plain.In neat arrangement thus the men of Kent,With native oak at once adorn'd and arm'd,Intrepid march'd; for well they knew the criesOf dying Liberty, and Astraea's voice,Who as she fled, to echoing woods complain'd▪Of tyranny, and William; like a god,Refulgent stood the conqueror, on his troopsHe sent his looks enliv'ning as the sun's,But on his foes frown'd agony, frown'd death.
On his left side in bright emblazonryHis falchion burn'd; forth from his sevenfold shieldA basilisk shot adamant; his browWore clouds of fury!—on that with plumage crown'dOf various hue sat a tremendous cone:Thus sits high-canopied above the clouds,Terrific beauty of nocturnal skies,Aurora Borealis, or lights in the air; a phoenomenon which of late years has been very frequent here, and in all the more northern countries. Northern Aurora; she thro' th' azure airShoots, shoots her trem'lous rays in painted streaksContinual, while waving to the windO'er Night's dark veil her lucid tresses flow.The trav'ler views th' unseasonable dayAstound, the proud bend lowly to the earth,The pious matrons tremble for the world.But what can daunt th' insuperable soulsOf Cantium's matchless sons? On they proceed,All innocent of fear; each face express'dContemptuous admiration, while they view'dThe well-fed brigades of embroider'd slavesThat drew the sword for gain. First of the van,With an enormous bough, a shepherd swainWhistled with rustic notes; but such as show'dA heart magnanimous: The men of Kent
Follow the tuneful swain, while o'er their headsThe green leaves whisper, and the big boughs bend.'Twas thus the Thracian, whose all-quick'ning lyreThe floods inspir'd, and taught the rocks to feel,Play'd before dancing Haemus, to the tune,The lute's soft tune! The flutt'ring branches wave,The rocks enjoy it, and the rivulets hear,The hillocks skip, emerge the humble vales,And all the mighty mountain nods applause.The conqueror view'd them, and as one that seesThe vast abrupt of Scylla, or as oneThat from th' oblivious Lethaean streamsHas drank eternal apathy, he stood.His host an universal panic seiz'dProdigious, inopine; their armour shook,And clatter'd to the trembling of their limbs;Some to the walking wilderness gan runConfus'd, and in th' inhospitable shadeFor shelter sought—Wretches! they shelter find,Eternal shelter in the arms of death!Thus when Aquarius pours out all his urn▪Down on some lonesome heath, the travellerThat wanders o'er the wint'ry waste, acceptsThe invitation of some spreading beechJoyous; but soon the treach'rous gloom betraysTh' unwary visitor, while on his headTh' inlarging drops in double show'rs descend.And now no longer in disguise the menOf Kent appear; down they all drop their boughs,And shine in brazen panoply divine.Enough—Great William (for full well he knewHow vain would be the contest) to the sonsOf glorious Cantium, gave their lives, and laws,And liberties secure, and to the prowessOf Kentish wights, like Caesar, deign'd to yield.Caesar and William! Hail immortal worthies,Illustrious vanquish'd! Cantium, if to them,Posterity will all her chiefs unborn,Ought similar, ought second has to boast.Once more (so prophecies the Muse) thy sonsShall triumph, emulous of their sires—till thenWith olive, and with hop-land garlands crown'd,O'er all thy land reign Plenty, reign fair Peace.THE HOP-GARDEN. A GEORGIC. BOOK the SECOND.Omnia quae multo ante memor provisa repones,Si te digna manet divini gloria ruris. VIRG. Geor. lib. 1.THE HOP-GARDEN. A GEORGIC. BOOK the SECOND.AT length the Muse her destin'd task resumesWith joy; agen o'er all her hop-land grovesShe longs t' expatiate free of wing. Long whileFor a much-loving, much-lov'd youth she wept,And sorrow'd silence o'er th' untimely urn.Hush then, effeminate sobs; and thou, my heart,Rebel to grief no more—And yet a while,A little while, indulge the friendly tears.O'er the wild world, like Noah's dove, in vainI seek the olive peace, around me wideSee! see! the wat'ry waste—In vain, forlornI call the Phoenix fair Sincerity;Alas!—extinguish'd to the skies she fled,And left no heir behind her. Where is nowTh' eternal smile of goodness? Where is now
That all-extensive charity of soul,So rich in sweetness, that the classic soundsIn elegance Augustan cloath'd, the witThat flow'd perennial, hardly were observ'd,Or, if observ'd, set off a brighter gem.How oft, and yet how seldom did it seem!Have I enjoy'd his converse?—When we met,The hours how swift they sweetly fled, and tillAgen I saw him, how they loiter'd. Oh!Mr. Theophilus Wheeler, of Christ-College, Cambridge. THEOPHILUS, thou dear departed soul,What flattering tales thou told'st me? How thou'dst hailMy Muse, and took'st imaginary walksAll in my hopland groves! Stay yet, oh stay!Thou dear deluder, thou hast seen but half—He's gone! and ought that's equal to his praiseFame has not for me, tho' she prove most kind.Howe'er this verse be sacred to thy name,These tears, the last sad duty of a friend.Oft i'll indulge the pleasurable painOf recollection; oft on Medway's banksI'll muse on thee full pensive; while her streamsRegardful ever of my grief, shall flowIn sullen silence silverly alongThe weeping shores—or else accordant withMy loud laments, shall ever and anonMake melancholy music to the shades,
The hopland shades, that on her banks exposeSerpentine vines and flowing locks of gold.Ye smiling nymphs, th' inseparable trainOf saffron Ceres; ye, that gamesome dance,And sing to jolly Autumn, while he standsWith his right hand poizing the scales of heav'n,And with his left grasps Amalthea's horn:Young chorus of fair bacchanals, descend,And leave a while the sickle; yonder hill,Where stand the loaded hop-poles, claims your care.There mighty Bacchus stradling cross the bin,Waits your attendance—There he glad reviewsHis paunch, approaching to immensityStill nearer, and with pride of heart surveysObedient mortals, and the world his own.See! from the great metropolis they rush,Th' industrious vulgar. They, like prudent bees,In Kent's wide garden roam, expert to cropThe flow'ry hop, and provident to work,Ere winter numb their sunburnt hands, and windsEngoal them, murmuring in their gloomy cells.From these, such as appear the rest t' excellIn strength and young agility, select.These shall support with vigour and addressThe bin-man's weighty office; now extractFrom the sequacious earth the pole, and now
Unmarry from the closely clinging vine.O'er twice three pickers, and no more, extendThe bin-man's sway; unless thy ears can bearThe crack of poles continual, and thine eyesBehold unmoved the hurrying peasant tearThy wealth, and throw it on the thankless ground.But first the careful planter will consultHis quantity of acres, and his crop,How many and how large his kilns; and thenProportion'd to his wants the hands provide.But yet, of greater consequence and cost,One thing remains unsung, a man of faithAnd long experience, in whose thund'ring voiceLives hoarse authority, potent to quellThe frequent frays of the tumultuous crew.He shall preside o'er all thy hop-land store,Severe dictator! His unerring hand,And eye inquisitive, in heedful guise,Shall to the brink the measure fill, and fairOn the twin registers the work record.And yet I've known them own a female reign,And gentle The Author's youngest Sister. Marianne's soft Orphean voiceHas hymn'd sweet lessons of humanityTo the wild brutal crew. Oft her commandHas sav'd the pillars of the hopland state,
The lofty poles from ruin, and sustain'd,Like ANNA, or ELIZA, her domain,With more than manly dignity. Oft I've seen,Ev'n at her frown the boist'rous uproar cease,And the mad pickers, tam'd to diligence,Cull from the bin the sprawling sprigs, and leavesThat stain the sample, and its worth debase.All things thus settled and prepared, what nowCan let the planters purposes? UnlessThe Heav'ns frown dissent, and ominous windsHowl thro' the concave of the troubled sky.And oft, alas! the long experienc'd wights(Oh! could they too prevent them) storms foresee.Numquam imprudentibus imberObfuit.

VIRG. Georg. 1. For, as the storm rides on the rising clouds,
Fly the fleet wild-geese far away, or elseThe heifer towards the zeinth rears her head,And with expanded nostrils snuffs the air:The swallows too their airy circuits weave,And screaming skim the brook; and fen-bred frogsForth from their hoarse throats their old grutch recite:Or from her earthly coverlets the antHeaves her huge eggs along the narrow way:Or bends Thaumantia's variegated bowAthwart the cope of heav'n: or sable crowsObstreperous of wing, in crouds combine:Besides, unnumber'd troops of birds marine,And Asia's feather'd flocks, that in the mudsOf flow'ry-edg'd Cayster wont to prey,Now in the shallows duck their speckled heads,And lust to lave in vain, their unctious plumesRepulsive baffle their efforts: Next harkHow the curs'd raven, with her harmful voice,Invokes the rain, ahd croaking to herself,Struts on some spacious solitary shore.Nor want thy servants and thy wife at homeSigns to presage the show'r; for in the hallSheds Niobe her prescious tears, and warnsBeneath thy leaden tubes to fix the vase,And catch the falling dew-drops, which supplySoft water and salubrious, far the bestTo soak thy hops, and brew thy generous beer.
But tho' bright Phoebus smile, and in the skiesThe purple-rob'd serenity appear;Tho' every cloud be fled, yet if the rageOf Boreas, or the blasting East prevail,The planter has enough to check his hopes,And in due bounds confine his joy; for seeThe ruffian winds, in their abrupt career,Leave not a hop behind, or at the bestMangle the circling vine, and interceptThe juice nutricious: Fatal means, alas!Their colour and condition to destroy.Haste then, ye peasants; pull the poles, the hops;Where are the bins? Run, run, ye nimble maids,Move ev'ry muscle, ev'ry nerve extend,To save our crop from ruin, and ourselves.Soon as bright Chanticleer explodes the nightWith flutt'ring wings, and hymns the new-born day,The bugle-horn inspire, whose clam'rous brayShall rouse from sleep the rebel rout, and tuneTo temper for the labours of the day.Wisely the several stations of the binsBy lot determine. Justice this, and thisFair Prudence does demand; for not withoutA certain method cou'dst thou rule the mobIrrational, nor every where alikeFair hangs the hop to tempt the picker's hand.Now see the crew mechanic might and mainLabour with lively diligence, inspir'dBy appetie of gain and lust of praise:What mind so petty, servile, and debas'd,As not to know ambition? Her great swayFrom Colin Clout to Emperors she exerts.To err is human, human to be vain.'Tis vanity, and mock desire of fame,That prompts the rustic, on the steeple topSublime, to mark the outlines of his shoe,And in the area to engrave his name.With pride of heart the churchwarden surveys,High o'er the bellfry, girt with birds and flow'rs,His story wrote in capitals: "'Twas I"That bought the font; and I repair'd the pews."With pride like this the emulating mobStrive for the mastery—who first may fillThe bellying bin, and cleanest cull the hops.Nor ought retards, unless invited outBy Sol's declining, and the evening's calm,Leander leads Laetitia to the sceneOf shade and fragrance—Then th' exulting bandOf pickers male and female, seize the fairReluctant, and with boist'rous force and brute,By cries unmov'd, they bury her in the bin.Nor does the youth escape—him too they seize,And in such posture place as best may serve

Soon as timeHas well exhausted twice two glasses more,They'll leap and crackle with their bursting seeds,For use domestic, or for sale mature.There are, who in the choice of cloth t'enfoldTheir wealthy crop, the viler, coarser sort,With prodigal oeconomy prefer:All that is good is cheap, all dear that's base.Besides, the planter shou'd a bait prepare,T' intrap the chapman's notice, and divertShrewd Observation from her busy pry.When in the bag thy hops the rustic treads,Let him wear heel-less sandals; nor presumeTheir fragrancy barefooted to defile:Such filthy ways for slaves in MalagaLeave we to practise—Whence I've often seen,When beautiful Dorinda's iv'ry handsHad built the pastry-fabric (food divineFor Christmas gambols and the hour of mirth)As the dry'd foreign fruit, with piercing eye,She cull'd suspicious—lo! she starts, she frownsWith indignation at a negro's nail.Should'st thou thy harvest for the mart design,Be thine own factor; nor employ those drones
Who've stings, but make no honey, felfish slaves!That thrive and fatten on the planter's toil.What then remains unsung? unless the careTo stack thy poles oblique in comely cones,Lest rot or rain destroy them—'Tis a sightMost seemly to behold, and gives, O Winter!A landskip not unpleasing ev'n to thee.And now, ye rivals of the hopland state,Madum and Dorovernia rejoice,How great amidst such rivals to excel!Let Greenwich, where Q.

Translated by the Rev. Mr. FAWKES, A. M.SAY, what uncommon cares disturb my rest,And kindle raptures foreign to my breast?From earth's low confines lift my mind on high,To trace new worlds revolving in the sky?Yes—I'm impatient of this orb of clay,And boldly dare to meditate my way,Where Fontinelle first saw the planets roll,And all the God tumultuous shakes my soul.'Tis He! He comes! and thro' the sun-bright skiesDrives foaming Pegasus, and thus he cries:"Cease, cease, dear youth, too studiously employ'd,"And wing with me the unresisting void;"'Tis thine with me round other worlds to soar,"And visit kingdoms never known before;"While I succinctly shew each various race,"The manners and the genius of the place."I (tho' my mind with lively horror fraught,Thinks on Bellerophon, and shudders at the thought)
Mount quick the winged steed; he springs, he flies,Shoots thro' the yielding air, and cleaves the liquid skies!—First, swift Cyllenius, circling round the sun,We reach, when thus my friendly guide begun:"Mark well the genius of this fiery place,"The wild amusements of the brainsick race,"Whose minds the beams of Titan, too intense,"Affect with frenzy, and distract the sense."A monarch here gives subject princes law,"A mighty monarch, with a crown of straw."There fits a lover, sad in pensive air,"And like the dismal image of despair,"With charcoal paints his Chloe heav'nly fair."In sadly-soothing strain rude notes he sings,"And strikes harsh numbers from the jarring strings."Lo! an astrologer, with filth besmear'd,"Rough and neglected, with a length of beard,"Pores round his cell for undiscover'd stars,"And decks the wall with triangles and squares."Lo!—But the radiant car of Phoebus nigh"Glows with red ardour, and inflames the sky—"Oh! waft me, hide me in some cool retreat;"I faint, I sicken with the fervent heat."Thence to that milder orb we wing our way,Where Venus governs with an easy sway.
Soft breathes the air; fair Flora paints the ground,And laughing Ceres deals her gifts around.This blissful Tempe no rough blasts molest,Of blust'ring Boreas, or the baleful East;But gentle Zephyrs o'er the woodlands stray,Court the tall trees, and round the branches play,AEtherial gales dispensing as they flow,To fan those passions which they teach to glow.Here the gay youth in measur'd steps advance,While sprightly music animates the dance;There the sweet melody of sound admire,Sigh with the song, or languish to the lyre:Fair nymphs and amorous youths, a lovely band,Blend in the dance, light-bounding hand in hand.From ev'ry grove the buxom Zephyrs bringThe rich ambrosia of eternal spring.Care dwells not here, their pleasures to destroy,But Laughter, Jest, and universal joy:All, all is love; for Venus reigns confestThe sole sultana of each captive breast:Cold Cynthia here wou'd Cupid's victim prove,Or the chaste daughter of imperial Jove,And Cato's virtue be the slave of love.But now thro' destin'd fields of air we fly,And leave those mansions, not without a sigh:
Thence the dire coast we reach, the dreary plains,Where Mars, grim god, and bloody discord reigns.The host in arms embattled sternly stands,The sword, the dart, the dagger, in their hands.Here no fair nymphs to silver sounds advance,But buskin'd heroes form the Pyrrhic dance.And brazen trumpets, terrible from far,With martial music fire the soul to war.Here the lone bride be wails her absent lord,The sterile nuptials, the deserted board,Sighs the long nights, and, frantic with despair,Beats her bare breast, and rends her flowing hair:In vain she sighs, in vain dissolves in tears—In sleep, perhaps, the warrior lord appears,A fleeting form that glides before her sight,A momentary vision of the night.Mean while, regardless of her anxious pray'r,The hardy husband sternly stalks to war;Our ears the clang of ringing armour rends,And the immortal battle never ends.Hence thro' the boundless void we nimbly move,And reach the wide-extended plains of Jove.Here the stern tyrant sways an iron rod;A thousand vassals tremble at his nod.How short the period of a tyrant's date!The pois'nous phial speeds the work of fate:
Scarce is the proud, imperious tyrant dead,But, lo! a second lords it in his stead.Here peace, as common merchandize, is sold,Heav'n's first best blessing for pernicious gold:War soon succeeds, the sturdy squadrons standWide o'er the fields a formidable band;With num'rous fleets they croud the groaning main,And triumph for the victories they feign:Again in strict alliances unite,Till discord raise again the phantom of a fight;Again they sail; again the troops prepareTheir falchions for the mockery of war.The son inhuman seeks his father's life,The slave his master's, and her lord's the wife.With vengeance thus their kindling bosoms fire,Since Jove usurp'd the sceptre of his fire.Thence poisons, perjuries, and bribes betray;Nor other passions do their souls obeyThan thirst of gold, and avarice of sway.At length we land, vast fields of aether crost,On Saturn's cold uncomfortable coast;Here in the gloom the pamper'd sluggards lullThe lazy hours, lethargically dull.In caves they live; for who was ever knownSo wise, so sedulous to build a town?The same stupidity infects the whole,Fix'd in the breast, and center'd in the soul.These never feel th' ambitious fires of Jove,To Industry not Mercury can move,Mars cannot spur to war, nor Venus woo to love.Here rove those souls, 'tis said, when life departs,Who never cultivated useful arts;But stupify'd with plenty and repose,Dreamt out long life in one continued dose!No feather'd songsters, with sweet-warbled strainsAttune to melting melody the plains,No flocks wide-past'ring bleat, nor oxen low,No fountains musically murm'ring flow;Th' ungenial waste no tender herbage yields,No harvests wave luxuriant in the fields.Low lie the groves, if groves this land can boast,Chain'd in the fetters of eternal frost,Their beauty wither'd, and their verdure lost.Dull animals inhabit this abode,The owl, mole, dormouse, tortoise, and the toad.Dull rivers deep within their channels glide,And slow roll on their tributary tide:Nor aught th' unvegetative waters feed,But sleepy poppy and the slimy reed;Whose lazy fogs, like Lethe's cups, dispenseEternal slumbers of dull indolence.Agast I stood, the drowsy vapours lullMy soul in gloom, ev'n Pegasus grew dull.My guide observ'd, and thrice he urg'd his speed,Thrice the loud lash resounded from the steed;Fir'd at the strokes, he flies with slacken'd reinSwift o'er the level of the liquid plain,Glides with the gentle gale, and lights on earth again.THE TEMPLE OF DULNESS.Translated by the same Hand.Materies gaudet vi Inertiae.VErvecum in patria, quà latè Hibernica squalentArva inarata, palus horrenda voragine crebrâAnte oculos jacet; haud illic impune viatorPer tenebras iter instituat; tremit undique tellusSub pedibus malefida, vapores undique densosSudat humus, nebulisque amicitur tristibus herba.Huc fato infelix si quando agiteris iniquo,Et tutò in medium liceat penetrare, videbisAttonitus, nigrâ de nube emergere templum,Templum ingens, immane, altum penetrale Stuporis.Plumbea stat turris, plumbum sinuatur in arcus,Et solido limosa tument fundamina plumbo.Hanc, pia Materies, Divo aedem extruxit inerti,Stultitiae impulsu—quid enim?

Translated by the same Hand.IN Ireland's wild, uncultivated plains,Where torpid sloth, and foggy dulness reigns,Full many a fen infests the putrid shore,And many a gulph the melancholy moor.Let not the stranger in these regions stray,Dark is the sky, and perilous the way;Beneath his foot-steps shakes the trembling ground,Dense fogs and exhalations hover round,And with black clouds the tender turf is crown'd.Here shou'd'st thou rove, by Fate's severe command,And safely reach the center of the land;Thine eyes shall view, with horror and surprize,The fane of Dulness, of enormous size,Emerging from the sable cloud arise.A leaden tow'r upheaves its heavy head,Vast leaden arches press the slimy bed,The soft soil swells beneath the load of lead.Old Matter here erected this abode,At Folly's impulse, to the Slothful God.
And here the drone lethargic loves to stay,Slumb'ring the dull, inactive hours away;For still, unless by foreign force imprest,The languid Goddess holds her state of rest.Their habitation here those monsters keep,Whom Matter father'd on the God of Sleep:Here Zoilus, with cank'ring envy pale,Here Maevius bids his brother Bavius, hail;Spinoza, Epicure, and all those mobsOf wicked wits, from Pyrrho down to Hobbes.How can the Muse recount the numerous crewOf frequent fools that crowd upon the view?Nor can learn'd Albion's sun that burns so clear,Disperse the dulness that involves them here.Boeotia thus remain'd, in days of yore,Senseless and stupid, tho' the neighb'ring shoreAfforded salutary hellebore:No cure exhal'd from Zephyr's buxom breeze,That gently brush'd the bosom of the seas,As oft to Lesbian fields he wing'd his way,Fanning fair Flora, and in airy playBreath'd balmy sighs, that melt the soul away.Behold that portico! how vast, how wide!The pillars Gothic, wrought with barb'rous pride:
Four monstrous shapes before the portal wait,Of horrid aspect, centry to the gate:Lo! in the entrance, with disdainful eye,In Logick's dark disguise, stands Sophistry:Her very front would common sense confound,Encompass'd with ten categories round:She from Old Matter, the great mother, came,By birth the eldest—and how like the dame!Her shrivel'd skin, small eyes, prodigious pate,Denote her shrewd, and subtle in debate:This hand a net, and that sustains a club,T' entangle her antagonist, or drub.The spider's toils, all o'er her garment spread,Imply the mazy errors of her head.Behold her marching with funereal pace,Slow as old Saturn rolls thro' boundless space,Slow as the mighty mountains mov'd along,When Orpheus rais'd the lyre-attended song:Or, as at Oxford, on some Gaudy day,Fat Beadles, in magnificent array,With big round bellies bear the pond'rous treat,And heavily lag on, with the vast load of meat.The next, mad Mathesis; her feet all bare,Ungirt, untrim'd, with dissoluted hair:No foreign object can her thoughts disjoint;Reclin'd she sits, and ponders o'er a point.
Before her, lo! inscrib'd upon the ground,Strange diagrams th' astonish'd sight confound,Right lines and curves, with figures square and roundWith these the monster, arrogant and vain,Boasts that she can all mysteries explain,And treats the sacred Sisters with disdain.She, when great Newton sought his kindred skies,Sprung high in air, and strove with him to rise,In vain—the mathematic mob restrainsHer flight, indignant, and on earth detains;E'er since the captive wretch her brains employsOn trifling trinkets, and on gewgaw toys.Microphile is station'd next in place,The spurious issue of celestial race;From heav'nly Physice she took her birth,Her sire a madman of the sons of earth;On flies she pores with keen, unwearied sight,And moths and butterflies, her dear delight;Mushrooms and flow'rs, collected on a string,Around her neck, around her temples cling,With all the strange production of the spring.With greedy eyes she'll search the world to findRare, uncouth animals of every kind;Whether along the humble ground they stray,Or nimbly sportive in the waters play,Or thro' the light expanse of aether fly,And with fleet pinions cleave the liquid sky.
Ye gales, that gently breathe upon our shore,O! let the Polypus be wasted o'er;How will the hollow dome of Dulness ring,With what loud joy receive the wond'rous thing?Applause will rend the skies, and all aroundThe quivering quagmires bellow back the sound;How will Microphile her joy attest,And glow with warmer raptures than the rest?This will the curious crocodile excell,The weaving worm, and silver-shining shell;No object e'er will wake her wonder thusAs Polypus, her darling Polypus.Lo! by the wounds of her creating knife,New Polypusses wriggle into life,Fast as they rise, she feeds with ample storeOf once rare flies, but now esteem'd no more.The fourth dire shape from mother Matter came,Dulness her sire, and Atheism is her name;In her no glimpse of sacred Sense appears,Depriv'd of eyes, and destitute of ears:And yet she brandishes a thousand tongues,And blasts the world with air-infecting lungs.Curs'd by her sire, her very words are wounds,No grove re-ecchoes the detested sounds.Whate'er she speaks all nature proves a lye,The earth, the heav'ns, the starry-spangled skyProclaim the wise, eternal Deity:The congregated waves in mountains drivenRoar in grand chorus to the Lord of Heaven;Thro' skies serene the glorious thunders roll,Loudly pronounce the God, and shake the sounding Pole.A river, murmuring from Lethaean source,Full to the fane directs its sleepy course;The Pow'r of Dulness, leaning on the brink,Here calls the multitude of fools to drink.Swarming they crowd to stupify the skull,With frequent cups contending to be dull.Me, let me taste the sacred stream, I cry'd,Without-stretch'd arm—the Muse my boon deny'd,And sav'd me from the sense-intoxicating tide.A MECHANICAL SOLUTION OF THE PROPAGATION of YAWNING.Translated by the same Hand.MUTUA OSCITATIONUM PROPAGATIO Solvi potest Mechanicè.MOMUS, scurra, procax superûm, quo tempore PallasExiluit cerebro Jovis, est pro more jocatusNescio quid stultum de partu: excanduit irâJupiter, asper, acerba tuens; "et tu quoque, dixit,"Garrule, concipies, faetum{que} ex ore profundes:"Haud mora, jamque supinus in aulâ extenditur ingensDerisor; dubiâ velantur lumina nocte;Stertit hians immane;—e naso Gallica clanguntClassica, Germani{que} simul sermonis amaror:Edita vix tandem est monstrum Polychasmia, prolesTanto digna parente, aviae{que} simillima Nocti.

Translated by the same Hand.WHEN Pallas issued from the brain of Jove,Momus, the Mimic of the Gods above,In his mock mood impertinently spoke,About the birth, some low, ridiculous joke:Jove, sternly frowning, glow'd with vengeful ire,And thus Indignant said th' Almighty Sire,"Loquacious Slave, that laugh'st without a cause,"Thou shalt conceive, and bring forth at thy jaws."He spoke—stretch'd in the hall the Mimic lies,Supinely dull, thick vapours dim his eyes:And as his jaws a horrid chasm disclose,It seem'd he made a trumpet of his nose;Tho' harsh the strain, and horrible to hear,Like German jargon grating on the ear.At length was Polychasmia brought to light,Worthy her sire, a monster of a sight,Resembling her great grandmother, Old Night.
Her eyes to open oft in vain she try'd,Lock'd were the lids, her mouth distended wide.Her when Prometheus happen'd to survey(Rival of Jove, that made mankind of clay)He form'd without the aid of heav'nly ray.To three Lethaean cups he learnt to mixDeep sighs of virgins, with three blasts from Styx,The bray of asses, with the fat of brawn,The sleep-preceding groan, and hideous yawn.Thus Polychasmia took her wond'rous birth,A Goddess helpful to the sons of earth.Lo! how the rustic multitude from farHaste to the town, and crowd the clam'rous bar.The prest bench groans with many a squire and knight,Who weight out justice, and distribute right:Severe they seem, and formidably big,With front important, and huge periwig.The little villains skulk aloof dismay'd,And panic terrors seize the pregnant maid.But soon friend Polychasm', who always near,Herself had mingled with their morning beer,Steals to the judges brain, and centers there.Then in the court the horrid yawn began,And Hum, profound and solemn, went from man to man:Silent they nod, and with prodigious strainStretch out their arms, then listless yawn again:
For all the flow'rs of rhetoric they can boast,Amidst their wranglings, is to gape the most:Ambiguous quirks, and friendly wrath they vent,And give and take the leaden argument.Ye too, Fanaticks, never shall escapeThe faithful muse; for who so greatly gape?Mounted on high, with serious care perplext,The miserable preacher takes his text;Then into parts minute, with wondrous pain,Divides, connects, and then divides again,And does with grave obscurity explain:While from his lips lean periods lingring creep,And not one meaning interrupts their sleep,The drowsy hearers stretch their weary jawsWith lamentable groan, and yawning gape applause.The Quacks of Physic next provoke my ire,Who falsely boast Hippocrates their sire:Goddess! thy sons I ken—verbose and loud,They puff their windy bubbles on the crowd:With look important, critical, and vain,Each to his nose applies the gilded cane;And as he nods, and ponders o'er the case,Gravely collects himself into his face,Explains his med'cines—which the rustic buys,Drinks the dire draught, and of the doctor dies;
No pills, no potions can to life restore;ABRACADABRA, necromantic pow'rCan charm, and conjure up from death no more.But more than aught that's marvellous and rare,The studious Soph makes Polychasm' his care;Explores what secret spring, what hidden cause,Distends with hideous chasm th' unwilling jaws,What latent ducts the dewy moisture pourWith sound tremendous, like a thunder-show'r:How subtile matter, exquisitely thin,Pervades the curious net-work of the skin,Affects th' accordant nerve—all eyes are drown'dIn drowsy vapours, and the yawn goes round▪When Phoebus thus his flying fingers flingsAcross the chords, and sweeps the trembling strings;If e'er a lyre at unison there be,It swells with emulating harmony,Like Memnon's harp, in ancient times renown'd,Breathing, untouch'd, sweet-modulated sound.But oh! ungrateful! to thy own true bard,Oh! Polychasm', is this my just reward?Thy drowsy dews upon my head distill,Just at the entrance of th' Aonian hill;Listless I gape, unactive, and supine,And at vast distance view the sacred Nine:Wistful I view—the streams increase my thirst,In vain—like Tantalus, with plenty curst,No draughts nectareous to my portion fall,These godlike Pope exhausts, and greatly claims them all.Thus the lean Sizar views, with gaze agast,The hungry Tutor at his noon's repast;In vain he grinds his teeth—his grudging eye,And visage sharp, keen appetite imply;Oft he attempts, officious, to conveyThe lessening relicks of the meal away—In vain—no morsel 'scapes the greedy jaw,All, all is gorg'd in magisterial maw;Till at the last, observant of his word,The lamentable waiter clears the board,And inly-murmuring miserably groans,To see the empty dish, and hear the sounding bones.A LATIN VERSION OF MILTON's L'ALLEGRO.HOM.L'ALLEGRO.HENCE, loathed Melancholy,Of Cerberus, and blackest Mid-night born,In Stygian cave forlorn,Mongst horrid shapes, and shrieks, and sights unholy,Find out some uncouth cell,Where brooding Darkness spreads his jealous wings,And the night-raven sings;There under ebon shades, and low-brow'd rocks,As ragged as thy locks,In dark Cimmerian desart ever dwell.But come thou Goddess fair and free,In Heav'n yclep'd Euphrosyne,And by men, heart-easing Mirth,Whom lovely Venus at a birthWith two sister Graces moreTo ivy-crowned Bacchus bore;Or whether (as some Sages sing)The frolick wind, that breathes the spring,
Zephyr with Aurora playing,As he met her once a Maying,There on beds of violets blue,And fresh blown roses wash'd in dew,Fill'd her with thee, a daughter fair,So buxom, blith, and debonair;Haste thee, Nymph, and bring with theeJest and youthful Jollity,Quips and cranks, and wanton wiles,Nods and becks, and wreathed smiles,Such as hang on Hebe's cheek,And love to live in dimple sleek;Sport, that wrinkled Care derides,And Laughter holding both his sides;Come, and trip it, as you go,On the light fantastic toe:And in thy right hand lead with theeThe mountain Nymph, sweet Liberty;And if I give thee honour due,Mirth, admit me of thy crew,To live with her, and live with thee,In unreproved pleasures free;To hear the lark begin his flight,And singing startle the dull night,From his watch-tow'r in the skies,Till the dappled dawn doth rise;
Then to come in spight of sorrow,And at my window bid good-morrow,Thro' the sweet-briar, or the vine,Or the twisted eglantine:While the cock with lively dinScatters the rear of darkness thin;And to the stack, or the barn-door,Stoutly struts his dames before.Oft list'ning how the hounds and hornChearly rouse the slumb'ring morn,From the side of some hoar hill,Thro' the high wood echoing shrill.Sometimes walking not unseenBy hedge-row elms, on hillocks green,Right against the eastern gate,Where the great sun begins his state,Rob'd in flames, and amber light,The clouds in thousand liveries dight.While the plowman near at hand,Whistles o'er the furrow'd land,And the milkmaid singeth blithe,And the mower whets his seythe,And every shepherd tells his taleUnder the hawthorn in the dale.Strait mine eye hath caught new pleasures,Whilst the landskip round it measures,
Russet lawns, and fallows gray,Where the nibbling flocks do strayMountains, on whose barren breastThe labouring clouds do often rest,Meadows trim with daizies pide,Shallow brooks, and rivers wide:Tow'rs and battlements it seesBosom'd high in tufted trees,Where perhaps some beauty liesThe Cynosure of neighbouring eyes.Hard by a cottage chimney smokes,From betwixt two aged oaks,Where Corydon and Thyrsis met,Are at their favory dinner setOf herbs and other country messes,Which the neat-handed Phillis dresses;And then in haste her bower she leavesWith Thestylis to bind the sheaves;Or if the earlier season leadTo the tann'd hay-cock in the mead,Sometimes with secure delightThe up-land Hamlets will invite,When the merry bells ring round,And the jocund rebecks soundTo many a youth and many a maid,Dancing in the chequer'd shade;
And young and old come forth to playOn a sun-shine holy-day,Till the live-long day-light fail,Then to the spicy nut-brown ale,With stories told of many a feat,How fairy Mab the junkets eat;She was pinch'd, and pull'd, she said,And by the Friar's lanthorn led;Tells how the drudging goblin sweat,To earn his cream-bowl duly set,When in one night, ere glimpse of morn,His shadowy flail hath thresh'd the cornThat ten day-labourers could not end,Then lies him down the lubbar fiend,And stretch'd out all the chimny's length,Basks at the fire his hairy strength;And crop-full out of doors he flings,Ere the first cock his mattin sings.Thus done the tales, to bed they creep,By whispering winds soon lull'd asleep.Towred cities please us then,And the busy humm of men,Where throngs of knights and barons bold,In weeds of peace high triumph hold,With store of ladies, whose bright eyesRain influence, and judge the prize
Of wit or arms, while both contendTo win her grace whom all commend.There let Hymen oft appear,In saffron robe, with taper clear,And pomp, and feast, and revelry,With mask and antique pageantry,Such sights as youthful poets dreamOn summer eves by haunted stream.Then to the well-trod stage anon,If Johnson's learned sock be on,Or sweetest Shakespear, Fancy's child,Warble his native wood-notes wild,And ever against eating caresLap me in soft Lydian airs,Married to immortal verse,Such as the meeting soul may pierceIn notes, with many a winding boutOf linked sweetness long drawn outWith wanton heed, and giddy cunning,The melting voice thro' mazes running;Untwisting all the chains that tyeThe hidden soul of harmony:
That Orpheus self may heave his headFrom golden slumber on a bedOf heap'd Elysian flow'rs, and hearSuch strains as would have won the earOf Pluto, to have quite set freeHis half-regain'd Eurydice.These delights, if thou canst give,Mirth, with thee I mean to live.'Ο ΠΑΙΓΝΙΩΔΣ.PROCUL hinc, O procul esto informis AEgrimonia,Quam janitori Obscuritas nigerrimaSuscepit olim Cerbero,Desertam in cavea Stygis profundâ,Horribiles inter formas, visusque prosanos,Obscoenosque ululatus,Incultam licet invenire sedem,Nox ubi parturiensZelotypis furtim nido superincubat alisQueriturque tristis noctua,Sub densis illic ebenis scopulisque cavatis,Vestri rugosis more supercilii,AEternùm maneas Cimmeriâ in domo.Sed huc propinquet comis et pulcherrima,Quae nympha divis audit Ephrosyne choris,Patiens tamen vocatur a mortalibusMedicina cordis hilaritas, quam candidaVenus duabus insuper cum GratiisDias Lyaeo patri in auras edidit:Sive ille ventus (caeteri ut Mystae canunt)Jocundus aurâ qui ver implet melleâ,

PHAEDRUS.SWEET WILLIAM. BALLAD I.I.BY a prattling stream, on a Midsummer's eve,Where the woodbine and jess'mine their boughs interweave,Fair Flora, I cry'd, to my arbour repair,For I must have a chaplet for sweet William's hair.II.She brought me the vi'let that grows on the hill,The vale dwelling lilly, and gilded jonquill:But such languid odours how cou'd I approve,Just warm from the lips of the lad that I love.III.She brought me, his faith and his truth to display,The undying myrtle, and ever-green bay:But why these to me, who've his constancy known?And Billy has laurels enough of his own.IV.The next was a gift that I could not contemn,For she brought me two roses that grew on a stem:Of the dear nuptial tie they stood emblems confest,So I kiss'd 'em, and press'd 'em quite close to my breast.V.She brought me a sun-flow'r—This, fair one's, your due;For it once was a maiden, and love-sick like you:Oh! give it me quick, to my shepherd I'll run,As true to his flame, as this flow'r to the sun.The LASS with the golden Locks. BALLAD II.I.NO more of my Harriot, of Polly no more,Nor all the bright beauties that charm'd me before;My heart for a slave to gay Venus I've sold,And barter'd my freedom for ringlets of gold:I'll throw down my pipe, and neglect all my flocks,And will sing to my lass with the golden locks.II.Tho' o'er her white forehead the gilt tresses flow,Like the rays of the sun on a hillock of snow;Such painters of old drew the Queen of the Fair,'Tis the taste of the antients, 'tis classical hair:And tho' witlings may scoff, and tho' raillery mocks,Yet I'll sing to my lass with the golden locks.III.To live and to love, to converse and be free,Is loving, my charmer, and living with thee:Away go the hours in kisses and rhime,Spite of all the grave lectures of old father Time;A fig for his dials, his watches and clocks,He's best spent with the lass of the golden locks.IV.Than the swan in the brook she's more dear to my sight,Her mien is more stately, her breast is more white,Her sweet lips are rubies, all rubies above,Which are fit for the language or labour of love;At the park in the mall, at the play in the box,My lass bears the bell with her golden locks.V.Her beautiful eyes, as they roll or they flow,Shall be glad for my joy, or shall weep for my woe;She shall ease my fond heart, and shall sooth my soft pain,While thousands of rivals are sighing in vain;Let them rail at the fruit they can't reach, like the fox,While I have the lass with the golden locks.The DECISION. BALLAD III.I.MY Florio, wildest of his sex,(Who sure the veriest saint wou'd vex)From beauty roves to beauty;Yet, tho' abroad the wanton roam,Whene'er he deigns to stay at home,He always minds his duty.II.Something to every charming she,In thoughtless prodigality,He's granting still and granting,To Phyllis that, to Cloe this,And every madam, every miss;Yet I find nothing wanting.III.If haply I his will displease,Tempestuous as th' autumnal seasHe foams and rages ever;
But when he ceases from his ire,I cry, such spirit, and such fire,Is surely wond'rous clever.IV.I ne'er want reason to complain;But sweet is pleasure after pain,And every joy grows greater.Then trust me, damsels, whilst I tell,I should not like him half so well,If I cou'd make him better.The TALKATIVE FAIR. BALLAD IV.I.FROM morn to night, from day to day,At all times and at every place,You scold, repeat, and sing, and say,Nor are there hopes, you'll ever cease.II.Fobear, my Celia, oh! forbear,If your own health, or ours you prize;For all mankind that hear you, swearYour tongue's more killing than your eyes.III.Your tongue's a traytor to your face,Your fame's by your own noise obscur'd,All are distracted while they gaze;But if they listen, they are cur'd.IV.Your silence wou'd acquire more praise,Than all you say, or all I write;One look ten thousand charms displays;Then hush—and be an angel quite.The SILENT FAIR. BALLAD V.I.FROM all her fair loquacious kind,So different is my Rosalind,That not one accent can I gainTo crown my hopes, or sooth my pain.II.Ye lovers, who can construe sighs,And are the interpreters of eyes,To language all her looks translate,And in her gestures read my fate.III.And if in them you chance to findOught that is gentle, ought that's kind,Adieu mean hopes of being great,And all the littleness of state.IV.All thoughts of grandeur I'll despise,Which from dependence take their rise;To serve her shall be my employ,And love's sweet agony my joy.The FORCE of INNOCENCE. To Miss C. BALLAD VI.I.THE blooming damsel, whose defenceIs adamantine innocence,Requires no guardian to attendHer steps, for modesty's her friend:Tho' her fair arms are weak to wieldThe glitt'ring spear, and massy shield;Yet safe from force and fraud combin'd,She is an Amazon in mind.II.With this artillery she goes,Not only 'mongst the harmless beaux:But even unhurt and undismay'd,Views the long sword and fierce cockade.Tho' all a syren as she talks,And all a goddess as she walks,Yet decency each action guides,And wisdom o'er her tongue presides.III.Place her in Russia's showery plains,Where a perpetual winter reigns,The elements may rave and range,Yet her fix'd mind will never change.Place her, Ambition, in thy tow'rs,'Mongst the more dang'rous golden show'rs,E'en there she'd spurn the venal tribe,And fold her arms against the bribe.IV.Leave her defenceless and alone,A pris'ner in the torrid zone,The sunshine there might vainly vieWith the bright lustre of her eye;But Phoebus' self, with all his fire,Cou'd ne'er one unchaste thought inspire.But virtue's path she'd still pursue,And still, my fair, wou'd copy you.The DISTRESSED DAMSEL. BALLAD VII.I.OF all my experience how vast the amount,Since fifteen long winters I fairly can count!Was ever a damsel so sadly betray'd,To live to these years and yet still be a maid?II.Ye heroes triumphant, by land and by sea,Sworn vott'ries to love, but undmindful of me;You can strom a strong fort, or can form a blockade,Yet ye stand by, like dastards, and see me a maid.III.Ye lawyers so just, who with slippery tongue,Can do what you please, or with right, or with wrong,Can it be, or by law or by equity said,That a buxom young girl ought to die an old maid?IV.Ye learned physicians, whose excellent skillCan save, or demolish, can cure, or can kill,To a poor, forlorn damsel contribute your aid,Who is sick—very sick—of remaining a maid.V.Ye fops, I invoke, not to list to my song,Who answer no end—and to no sex belong;Ye echoes of echoes, and shadows of shade—For if I had you—I might still be a maid.The FAIR RECLUSE. BALLAD VIII.I.YE ancient patriarchs of the wood,That veil around these awful glooms,Who many a century have stoodIn verdant age, that ever blooms.II.Ye Gothic tow'rs, by vapours dense,Obscur'd into severer state,In pastoral magnificenceAt once so simple and so great.III.Why all your jealous shades on me,Ye hoary elders do ye spread?Fair Innocence shou'd still be free,Nought shou'd be chain'd, but what we dread.IV.Say, must these tears for ever flow?Can I from patience learn content,While solitude still nurses woe,And leaves me leisure to lament.V.My guardian see!—who wards off peace,Whose cruelty is his employ,Who bids the tongue of transport cease,And stops each avenue to joy?VI.Freedom of air alone is giv'n,To aggravate, not sooth my grief,To view th' immensely-distant heav'n,My nearest prospect of relief.To Miss  one of the Chichester Graces. BALLAD IX.Written in Goodwood Gardens, September 1750.I."YE hills that overlook the plains,"Where wealth and Gothic greatness reigns,"Where Nature's hand by Art is check'd,"And Taste herself is architect;"Ye fallows grey, ye forests brown,"And seas that the vast prospect crown,"Ye freight the soul with fancy's store,"Nor can she one idea more!"II.I said—when dearest of her kind(Her form the picture of her mind)Chloris approach'd—The landskip flew!All nature vanish'd from my view!She seem'd all Nature to comprize,Her lips! her beauteous breasts! her eyes!That rous'd, and yet abash'd desire,With liquid, languid, living fire!III.But then—her voice!—how fram'd t' endear!The music of the Gods to hear!Wit that so pierc'd, without offence,So brac'd by the strong nerves of sense!Pallas with Venus play'd her part,To rob me of an honest heart;Prudence and Passion jointly strove,And Reason was th' ally of Love.IV.Ah me! thou sweet, delicious maid,From whence shall I sollicit aid?Hope and despair alike destroy,One kills with grief, and one with joy.Celestial Chloris! Nymph divine!To save me, the dear task be thine.Tho' conquest be the woman's care,The angel's glory is to spare.The PHYSICIAN and the MONKEY. An EPIGRAM.A LADY sent lately to one Doctor Drug,To come in an instant, and clyster poor Pug—As the fair one commanded he came at the word,And did the grand office in tie-wig and sword.The affair being ended, so sweet and so nice!He held out his hand with—"You know, ma'am, my price.""Your price," says the lady—"Why, Sir, he's your brother,"And doctors must never take fees of each other."APOLLO and DAPHNE. An EPIGRAM.WHEN Phoebus was am'rous, and long'd to be rude,Miss Daphne cry'd Pish! and ran swift to the wood,And rather than do such a naughty affair,She became a fine laurel to deck the God's hair.The nymph was, no doubt, of a cold constitution;For sure to turn tree was an odd resolution!Yet in this she behav'd like a true modern spouse,For she fled from his arms to distinguish his brows.The BAG-WIG and the TOBACCO-PIPE. A FABLE.A Bag-wig of a jauntee air,Trick'd up with all a barber's care,Loaded with powder and perfume,Hung in a spendthrift's dressing-room;Close by its side, by chance convey'd,A black Tobacco-pipe was laid;And with its vapours far and near,Outstunk the essence of Monsieur;At which its rage, the thing of hair,Thus, bristling up, began declare."Bak'd dirt! that with intrusion rude"Breaks in upon my solitude,"And with thy fetid breath defiles"The air for forty thousand miles—
"Avaunt—pollution's in thy touch—"O barb'rous English! horrid Dutch!"I cannot bear it—Here, Sue, Nan,"Go call the maid to call the man,"And bid him come without delay,"To take this odious pipe away."Hideous! sure some one smoak'd thee, Friend,"Reversely, at his t'other end."Oh! what mix'd odours! what a throng"Of salt and sour, of stale and strong!"A most unnatural combination,"Enough to mar all perspiration—"Monstrous! again—'twou'd vex a saint!"Susan, the drops—or else I faint!"The pipe (for 'twas a pipe of soul)Raising himself upon his bole,In smoke, like oracle of old,Did thus his sentiments unfold."Why, what's the matter, Goodman Swagger,"Thou flaunting French, fantastic bragger?"Whose whole fine speech is (with a pox)"Ridiculous and heterodox."'Twas better for the English nation"Before such scoundrels came in fashion,"When none sought hair in realms unknown,"But every blockhead bore his own.
"Know, puppy, I'm an English pipe,"Deem'd worthy of each Briton's gripe,"Who, with my cloud-compelling aid"Help our plantations and our trade,"And am, when sober and when mellow,"An upright, downright, honest fellow."Tho' fools, like you, may think me rough,"And scorn me, 'cause I am in buff,"Yet your contempt I glad receive,"'Tis all the fame that you can give:"None finery or fopp'ry prize;"But they who've something to disguise;"For simple nature hates abuse,"And Plainness is the dress of Use."CARE and GENEROSITY. A FABLE.OLD Care with Industry and Art,At length so well had play'd his Part;He heap'd up such an ample store,That Av'rice cou'd not sigh for more:Ten thousand flocks his shepherd told,His coffers overflow'd with Gold;The land all round him was his own,With corn his crouded granaries groan.
In short so vast his charge and gain,That to possess them was a pain;With happiness oppress'd he lies,And much too prudent to be wise.Near him there liv'd a beauteous maid,With all the charms of youth array'd;Good, amiable, sincere and free,Her name was Generosity.'Twas hers the largess to bestowOn rich and poor, on friend and foe.Her doors to all were open'd wide,The pilgrim there might safe abide:For th' hungry and the thirsty crew,The bread she broke, the drink she drew;There Sickness laid her aching head,And there Distress cou'd find a bed.—Each hour with an all-bounteous hand,Diffused she blessings round the land:Her gifts and glory lasted long,And numerous was th' accepting throng.At length pale Penury seiz'd the dame,And Fortune fled, and Ruin came,She found her riches at an end,And that she had not made one friend.—All cursed her for not giving more,Nor thought on what she'd done before;
She wept, she rav'd, she tore her hair,When lo! to comfort her came Care.—And cry'd, my dear, if you will join,Your hand in nuptial bonds with mine;All will be well—you shall have store,And I be plagu'd with Wealth no more.—Tho' I restrain your bounteous heart,You still shall act the generous part.—The Bridal came—great was the feast,And good the pudding and the priest;The bride in nine moons brought him forthA little maid of matchless worth:Her face was mix'd of Care and Glee,They christen'd her Oeconomy;And styled her fair Discretion's Queen,The mistress of the golden mean.Now Generosity confin'd,Is perfect easy in her mind;She loves to give, yet knows to spare,Nor wishes to be free from Care.AN OCCASIONAL PROLOGUE and EPILOGUE TO OTHELLO,As it was acted at the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane, on Thursday the 7th of March 1751, by Persons of Distinction for their Diversion.WHILE mercenary actors tread the stage,And hireling scriblers lash or lull the age,Ours be the task t'instruct, and entertain,Without one thought of glory or of gain.Virtue's her own—from no external cause—She gives, and she demands the Self-applause:Home to her breast she brings the heart-felt bays,Heedless alike of profit, and of praise.This now perhaps is wrong—yet this we know,'Twas sense and truth a century ago:When Britain with transcendent glory crown'd,For high atchievements, as for wit renown'd;
Cull'd from each growing grace the purest part,And cropt the flowers from every blooming art.Our noblest youth would then embrace the taskOf comic humour, or the mystic masque.'Twas theirs t'incourage worth, and give to bardsWhat now is spent in boxing and in cards:Good sense their pleasure—Virtue still their guide,And English magnanimity—their pride.Methinks I see with Fancy's magic eye,The shade of Shakespear, in yon azure sky.On you high cloud behold the bard advance,Piercing all Nature with a single glance:In various attitudes around him standThe passions, waiting for his dread command.First kneeling Love before his feet appears,And musically sighing melts in tears.Near him fell Jealousy with fury burns,And into storms the amorous breathings turns;Then Hope with heavenward look, and Joy draws near,While palsied Terror trembles in the rear.Such Shakespear's train of horror and delight,And such we hope to introduce to-night.But if, tho' just in thought, we fail in fact,And good intention ripens not to act,Weigh our design, your censure still defer,When truth's in view 'tis glorious e'en to err.EPILOGUE. Spoken by DESDEMONA.TRUE woman to the last—my perorationI come to speak in spight of suffocation;To shew the present and the age to come,We may be choak'd, but never can be dumb.Well now methinks I see you all run out,And haste away to Lady Bragwell's rout;Each modish sentiment to hear and weigh,Of those who nothing think, and all things say.Prudella first in parody begins,(For Nonsense and Buffoonery are twins)"Can beaux the court for theatres exchange?"I swear by Heaven 'tis strange, 'tis passing strange;"And very whimsical, and mighty dull,"And pitiful, and wond'rous pitiful:"I wish I had not heard it—Blessed dame!Whene'er she speaks her audience wish the same.Next Neddy Nicely—"Fye, O fye, good lack,"A nasty man to make his face all black."Then Lady Stiffneck shews her pious rage,And wonders we shou'd act—upon a stage.
"Why, ma'me, says Coquetilla, a disgrace?"Merit in any form may shew her face:"In this dull age the male things ought to play,"To teach them what to do, and what to say."In short, they all with different cavils cram us,And only are unanimous to damn us.But still there are a fair judicious few,Who judge unbiass'd, and with candour view;Who value honesty, tho' clad in buff,And wit, tho' dress'd in an old English ruff.Behold them here—I beaming sense descry,Shot from the living lustre of each eye.Such meaning smiles each blooming face adorn,As deck the pleasure-painted brow of morn;And shew the person of each matchless fair,Tho' rich to rapture, and above compare,Is, even with all the skill of heaven design'd,But an imperfect image of their mind;While chastity unblemish'd and unbrib'dAdds a majestic mien that scorns to be describ'd:Such, we will vaunt, and only such as these,'Tis our ambition, and our fame to please.THE JUDGMENT OF MIDAS. A MASQUE.Auriculas Asini Mida Rex habet. JUV.PERSONS represented.APOLLO.PAN.TIMOLUS, God of the Mountain.MIDAS.CALLIOPE.MELPOMENE.AGNO, MELINOE, Two Wood-nymphs.SATYRS, &c.THE JUDGMENT of MIDAS.TIMOLUS, MELINOE and AGNO, two Wood-nymphs.TIMOLUS.AGNO, To-day we wear our acron crown,The parsley wreath be thine; it is most meetWe grace the presence of these rival godsWith all the honours of our woodland weeds.Thine was the task, Melinoe, to prepareThe turf-built theatre, the boxen bow'r,And all the sylvan scen'ry.MELINOE.That task,Sire of these shades, is done. On yester eve,Assisted by a thousand friendly fays,While fav'ring Dian held her glitt'ring lamp,
We ply'd our nightly toils, nor ply'd we long,For Art was not the mistress of our revels,'Twas gentle Nature, whom we jointly woo'd;She heard, and yielded to the forms we taught her,Yet still remain'd herself—Simplicity,Fair Nature's genuine daughter, was there too,So soft, yet so magnificent of mien,She shone all ornament without a gem.The blithsome Flora, ever sweet and young,Offer'd her various store: We cull'd a fewTo robe, and recommend our darksome verdure,But shun'd to be luxuriant.—TIMOLUS.It was well.Agno, thy looks are pensive: What dejectsThy pleasure-painted aspect? Sweetest nymph,That ever trod the turf, or sought the shade,Speak, nor conceal a thought.AGNO.King of the woods,I tremble for the royal arbiter.'Tis hard to judge, whene'er the great contend,Sure to displease the vanquish'd: When such pow'rsContest the laurel with such ardent strife,'Tis not the sentence of fair equity,But 'tis their pleasure that is right or wrong.TIMOLUS.'Tis well remark'd, and on experience founded.I do remember that my sister Ida(Whenas on her own shadowy mount we met,To celebrate the birth-day of the Spring,And th' orgies of the May) wou'd oft recountThe rage of the indignant goddesses,When shepherd Paris to the Cyprian queen,With hand obsequious gave the golden toy.Heav'n's queen, the sister and the wife of Jove,Rag'd like a feeble mortal; fall'n she seem'd,Her deity in human passions lost:Ev'n Wisdom's goddess, jealous of her form,Deem'd her own attribute her second virtue.Both vow'd and sought revenge.AGNO.If such the fateOf him who judg'd aright, what must be hisWho shall mistake the cause? for much I doubtThe skill of Midas, since his fatal wish:Which Bacchus heard, and curs'd him with the gift.Yet grant him wise, to err is human still,And mortal is the consequence.MELINOE.Most true.Besides, I fear him partial; for with Pan
He tends the sheep-walks all the live-long day,And on the braky lawn to the shrill pipeIn aukward gambols he affects to dance,Or tumbles to the tabor—'tis not likelyThat such an umpire shou'd be equitable,Unless he guess at justice.TIMOLUS.Soft—no more—'Tis ours to wish for Pan, and fear from Phoebus,Whose near approach I hear: Ye stately cedarsForth from your summits bow your awful heads,And reverence the gods. Let my whole mountain tremble,Not with a fearful, but religious awe,And holiness of horror. You, ye winds,That make soft, solemn music 'mongst the leaves,Be all to stillness hush'd; and thou their echoListen, and hold thy peace; for see they come.SCENE opens, and discovers Apollo, attended by Clio and Melpomene, on the right hand of Midas, and Pan on the left, whom Timolus, with Agno and Melinoe, join.MIDAS.Begin, celestial candidates for praise,Begin the tuneful contest: I, mean while,
With heedful notice and attention meet,Will weigh your merits, and decide your cause.APOLLO.From Jove begin the rapturous song,To him our earliest lays belong,We are his offspring all;'Twas he, whose looks supremely bright,Smil'd darksome chaos into light,And fram'd this glorious ball.PAN.Sylvanus, in his shadowy grove,The seat of rural peace and love,Attends my Doric lays;By th' altar on the myrtle mount,Where plays the wood-nymph's favourite fount,I'll celebrate his praise.CLIO.Parnassus, where's thy boasted height,Where, Pegasus, thy fire and flight,Where all your thoughts so bold and free,Ye daughters of Mnemosyne?If Pan o'er Phoebus can prevail,And the great god of verse shou'd fail?AGNO.From nature's works, and nature's laws,We find delight, and seek applause;
The prattling streams and zephyrs bland,And fragrant flow'rs by zephyrs fann'd,The level lawns and buxom bow'rs,Speak Nature and her works are ours.MELPOMENE.What were all your fragrant bow'rs,Splendid days, and happy hours,Spring's verdant robe, fair Flora's blush,And all the poets of the bush?What the paintings of the grove,Rural music, mirth and love?Life and ev'ry joy wou'd pall,If Phoebus shone not on you all.MELINOE.We chant to Phoebus, king of day,The morning and the evening lay.But Pan, each satyre, nymph and fawn,Adore as laureat of the lawn;From peevish March to joyous JuneHe keeps our restless souls in tune,Without his oaten reed and song,Phoebus, thy days wou'd seem too long.APOLLO.Am I not he, who prescious from on high,Sends a long look thro' all futurity?Am I not he, to whom alone belongThe powers of Med'cine, Melody and Song?
Diffusely lib'ral, as divinely bright,Eye of the universe and sire of light.PAN.O'er cots and vales, and every shepherd swain,Inpeaceable pre-eminence I reign;With pipe on plain, and nymph in secret grove,The day is music, and the night is love.I blest with these, nor envy nor desireThy gaudy chariot, or thy golden lyre.CLIO.Soon as the dawn dispels the dark,Illustrious Phoebus 'gins t' appear,Proclaimed by the herald lark,And ever-wakeful chanticleer,The Persian pays his morning vow,And all the turban'd easterns bow.AGNO.Soon as the evening shades advance,And the gilt glow-worn glitters fair,For rustic gambol, gibe and dance,Fawns, nymphs and dryads all prepare,Pan shall his swains from toil relieve,And rule the revels of the eve.MELPOMENE.In numbers as smooth as Callirhoe's stream,Glide the silver-ton'd verse when Apollo's the theme;
While on his own mount Cyparissus is seen,And Daphne preserves her immutable green.We'll hail Hyperion with transport so long,Th' inventor, the patron, and subject of song.MELINOE.While on the calm ocean the Halcyon shall breed,And Syrinx shall sigh with her musical reed,While fairies, and satyres, and fawns shall approveThe music, the mirth, and the life of the grove,So long shall our Pan be than thee more divine,For he shall be rising when thou shalt decline.MIDAS.No more—To Pan and to his beauteous nymphsI do adjudge the prize, as is most due.Enter two Satyres, and crown MIDAS with a pair of ass's earsAPOLLO.Such rural honours all the gods decree,To those who sing like Pan, and judge like thee.[Exeunt Omnes.FINIS.
