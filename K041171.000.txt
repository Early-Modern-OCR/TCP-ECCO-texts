ON THE
BATTLE of Dettingen.I.ILlustrious Prince! by Heav'n design'dTo guard the Rights of Humankind,And raise a falling State:To scourge the Proud, support the Brave,To check Oppressive Pow'r, and saveAn Empire from it's Fate:II.What Poet, with Maeonian Wing,Shall your Immortal Praises sing,And glorious Acts record?Tell, how young William bravely bled;How Bourbon's Legions trembling fledBefore your Conq'ring Sword?III.The Muse admires the noble Theme;The Muse would gladly sound your Fame;But fearing War's Alarms,With conscious Modesty recedes,Unable to recite the DeedsOf your Victorious Arms.IV.She trembles, when her Monarch daresThe thickest Dangers of the Wars,Like Mars on Phrygian Ground;Nor can she sing, how William stood,Drenching the Field with Gallic Blood,Regardless of his Wound.V.Nor how the Mayne, with Purple dy'd,(For Purple Streams increas'd his Tide)Shook with the Cannon's Roar;And while you thunder'd o'er the Plain,Roll'd under floating Heaps of Slain,That spread his Surface o'er.VI.Noailles beheld your hardy Deed;Beheld his fainting Squadrons bleed,And Heaps on Heaps expire:He saw; and sounded a Retreat;Unable to sustain the HeatOf your resistless Fire.VII.Then rose the Genius of the Rhine;(No juicy Honours of the VineAdorn'd his plunder'd Head;His Front indented deep with Scars,The recent Marks of lawless Wars;)And thus to Noailles said:VIII.Did ever tim'rous Sheep exploreThe Lion on the Afric Shore,Or dare the Tiger's Hate?Did ever feeble Doves engageAgainst the martial Eagle's Rage,And court their certain Fate?IX.Fools that you were, to pass the Mayne,To seek Augustus on the Plain,Whom virtuous Glory warms!When British Chiefs the Battle try,Your greatest Triumph is to Fly,And 'scape their vengeful Arms.X.Contend no more for foreign Crowns;Retreat, and fortify your Towns;Secure your Monarch's Throne:Lest Bourbon mourn his ruin'd State;And GEORGE'S conq'ring Arms compleatWhat Edward's but begun.XI.Should William once invade your Land,The Lightning darted from his HandWould burn without Controul:Your Arms may then oppose in vain;Your Thunder wound the Youth again,Not move his daring Soul.XII.For, bravely warm'd with Martial Rage,And Courage that transcends his Age,He imitates his Sire:That Sire, so early known to France;Who, scorning Danger, durst advanceThro' Clouds of Smoke and Fire.XIII.Muse, whither would thy Fancy soar?These Subjects far surpass thy Pow'r,And suit sublimer Lays:From GEORGE'S glorious Name refrain;Nor with thy low ignoble StrainDegrade brave WILLIAM'S Praise.FINIS.
