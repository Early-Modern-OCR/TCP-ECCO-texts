PREFACE.I.ON yonder verdant hillock laidWhere oaks and elms, a friendly shade!O'erlook the falling stream,O master of the Latin lyre!A while with thee will I retireFrom summer's noontide beam.II.And lo! within my lonely bow'rTh' industrious bee from many a flow'rCollects her balmy dews;"For me," she sings, "the gems are born,"For me their silken robe adorn,"Their fragrant breath diffuse."III.Sweet Murmurer! may no rude stormThis hospitable scene deform.Nor check thy gladsome toils;Still may the buds unsully'd spring,Still show'rs and sunshine court thy wingTo these ambrosial spoils.IV.Nor shall my Muse hereafter failHer sellow-lab'rer thee to hail,And lucky be the strains!For long ago did Nature frameYour seasons and your arts the same,Your pleasures and your pains.V.Like thee in lowly sylvan scenes,On river-banks and flow'ry greens,My Muse delighted plays,Nor thro' the desert of the airTho' swans or eagles triumph thereWith fond ambition strays;VI.Nor where the boding raven chants,Nor near the owl's unhallow'd haunts,Will she her cares employ,But flies from ruins and from tombs,From Superstition's horrid glooms,To daylight and to joy.VII.Nor will she tempt the barren waste,Nor deigns the lurking strength to tasteOf any noxious thing,But leaves with scorn to Envy's useTh' insipid nightshade's baneful juice,The nettle's sordid sting.VIII.From all which Nature fairest knows,The vernal blooms the summer rose,She draws her blameless wealth,And when the gen'rous task is doneShe consecrates a double boonTo pleasure and to health.ODE II. ON THE WINTER SOLSTICE, MDCCXL.I.THE radiant ruler of the yearAt length his wintry goal attains,Soon to reverse the long career,And northward bend his steady reins.Now piercing half Potosi's heightProne rush the siery floods of light,Ripening the mountain's silver stores,While in some cavern's horrid shadeThe panting Indian hides his head,And oft' th' approach of eve implores.II.But lo! on this deserted coastHow pale the sun, how thick the air!Must'ring his storms, a sordid host!Lo! Winter desolates the year.The fields resign their latest bloom,No more the breezes waft perfume,
No more the streams in musick roll,But snows fall dark or rains resound,And while great Nature mourns aroundHer griefs infect the human soul.III.Hence the loud city's busy throngsUrge the warm bowl and splendid sire;Harmonious dances, festive songs,Against the spiteful heav'n conspire.Mean-time perhaps with tender fearsSome village-dame the curfew hearsWhile round the hearth her children play:At morn their father went abroad,The moon is sunk and deep the road;She sighs, and wonders at his stay.IV.But thou my Lyre! awake, arise,And hail the sun's returning force;Ev'n now he climbs the northern skies,And health and hope attend his course.Then louder howl th' aerial waste,Be earth with keener cold embrac'd,Yet gentle hours advance their wing,And Fancy, mocking Winter's might,With flow'rs, and dews, and streaming light,Already decks the newborn spring.V.O Fountain of the golden day!Could mortal vows promote thy speed,
How soon before thy vernal rayShould each unkindly damp recede!How soon each hov'ring tempest flyWhose stores for mischief arm the skyPrompt on our heads to burst amain,To rend the forest from the steep,Or thund'ring o'er the Baltick deepTo whelm the merchant's hopes of gain!VI.But let not man's unequal viewsPresume o'er Nature and her laws;'Tis his with grateful joy to useTh' indulgence of the Sovran Cause;Secure that health and beauty springsThro' this majestick frame of thingsBeyond what he can reach to know,And that Heav'n's allsubduing willWith good the progeny of illAttemp'reth ev'ry state below.VII.How pleasing wears the wintry nightSpent with the old illustrious dead!While by the taper's trembling lightI seem those awful scenes to treadWhere chiefs or legislators lieWhose triumphs move before my eyeIn arms and antick pomp array'd,While now I taste th' Ionian song,
Now bend to Plato's godlike tongueResounding thro' the olive shade.VIII.But should some cheerful equal friendBid leave the studious page a while,Let Mirth on Wisdom then attend,And social Ease on learned Toil;Then while at Love's uncareful shrineEach dictates to the god of WineHer name whom all his hopes obey,What flatt'ring dreams each bosom warm,While absence height'ning ev'ry charmInvokes the slow-returning May!IX.May, thou delight of heav'n and earth!When will thy genial star arise?Th' auspicious morn which gives thee birthShall bring Eudora to my eyes.Within her sylvan haunt behold,As in the happy garden old,She moves like that primeval fair:Thither ye silver-sounding Lyres!Ye tender Smiles, ye chaste Desires!Fond Hope and mutual Faith! repair.X.And if believing Love can readHis better omens in her eye,Then shall my fears, O charming Maid!And ev'ry pain of absence die;
Then shall my jocund harp, attun'dTo thy true ear, with sweeter soundPursue the free Horatian song;Old Tyne shall listen to my tale,And Echo down the bord'ring valeThe liquid melody prolong.ODE II. FOR THE WINTER SOLSTICE, December 11, 1740This Ode was afterwards entirely altered, as may be seen p. 7.—The reader will not be displeased to see it as it was originally written..I.Now to the utmost southern goalThe sun has trac'd his annual way,And backward now prepares to roll,And bless the North with earlier day.Prone on Potosi's lofty browFloods of sublimer splendour flow,Ripening the latent seeds of gold,Whilst panting in the lonely shadeTh' afflicted Indian hides his head,Nor dares the blaze of noon behold.II.But lo' on this deserted coastHow faint the light, how chill the air!
Lo! arm'd with whirlwind, hail, and frost,Fierce Winter desolates the year.The fields resign their cheerful bloom,No more the breezes breathe perfume,No more the warbling waters roll;Deserts of snow fatigue the eye,Successive tempests bloat the sky,And gloomy damps oppress the soul.III.But let my drooping genius riseAnd hail the sun's remotest ray,Now now he climbs the northern skies,To-morrow nearer than to-day.Then louder howl the stormy wasteBy sand and ocean worse defac'd,Yet brighter hours are on the wing,And Fancy thro' the wintry gloom,Radiant with dews and flow'rs in bloom,Already hails th' emerging spring.IV.O Fountain of the golden day!Could mortal vows but urge thy speed,How soon before the vernal rayShould each unkindly damp recede!How soon each tempest hov'ring flyThat now fermenting loads the sky,Prompt on our heads to burst amain,
To rend the forest from the steep,And thund'ring o'er the Baltick deepTo whelm the merchant's hopes of gain!V.But let not man's imperfect viewsPresume to tax wise Nature's laws;'Tis his with silent joy to useTh' indulgence of the Sov'reign Cause;Secure that from the whole of thingsBeauty and good consummate springsBeyond what he can reach to know,And that the providence of Heav'nHas some peculiar blessing giv'nTo each allotted state below.VI.Ev'n now how sweet the wintry nightSpent with the old illustrious dead!While by the taper's trembling lightI seem the awful course to treadWhere chiefs and legislators lieWhose triumphs move before my eyeWith ev'ry laurel fresh display'd,While charm'd I rove in classick song,Or bend to Freedom's fearless tongue,Or walk the academick shade.ODE III. TO A FRIEND UNSUCCESSFUL IN LOVE.I.INDEED my Phaedria! if to findThat wealth can female wishes gainHad e'er disturb'd your thoughtful mindOr cost one serious moment's pain,I should have said that all the rulesYou learn'd of moralists and schoolsWere very useless, very vain.II.Yet I perhaps mistake the case.—Say, tho' with this heroick air,Like one that holds a nobler chase,Yu try the tender loss to bear,Does not your heart renounce your tongue?Seems not my censure strangely wrongTo count it such a slight affair?III.When Hesper gilds the shaded skyOft' as you seek the wellknown grove,Methinks I see you cast your eyeBack to the morning scenes of love:Each pleasing word you heard her say,Her gentle look her graceful way,Again your struggling fany move.IV.Then tell me, is your soul entire?Does Wisdom calmly hold her throne?Then can you question each desire,Bid this remain and that be gone?No tear half starting from your eye?No kindling blush you know not why?No stealing sigh nor stifled groan?V.Away with this unmanly mood!See where the hoary churl appearsWhose hand hath seiz'd the fav'rite goodWhich you reserv'd for happier years,While side by side the blushing maidShrinks from his visage half afraidSpite of the sickly joy she wears.VI.Ye guardian Pow'rs of Love and Fame!This chaste harmonious pair behold,And thus reward the gen'rous flameOf all who barter vows for gold.O bloom of youth! O tender charms!Well bury'd in a dotard's arms!O equal price of beauty sold!VII.Cease then to gaze with looks of love;Bid her adieu the venal fair;Unworthy she your bless to prove,
Then wherefore should she prove your care?No: lay your myrtle garland down,And let a while the willow's crownWith luckier omens bind your hair.VIII.O just ecaped the faithless main,Tho' driv'n unwilling on the land,To guide your favour'd steps againBehold your better genius stand!Where Truth revolves her page divine,Where Virtue leads to Honour's shrine,Behold he lifts his awful hand!IX.Fix but on these your ruling aimAnd Time, the sire of manly care,Will Fancy's dazzling colours tame,A sob'rer dress will Beauty wear;Then shall Esteem by Knowledge ledInthrone within your heart and headSome happier love, some truer fair.ODE IV. AFFECTED INDIFFERENCE. TO THE SAME.I.YES, you contemn the perjur'd maidWho all your fav'rite hopes betray'd,Nor tho' her heart should home return,Her tuneful tongue its falsehood mourn,
Her winning eyes your faith implore,Would you her hand receive again,Or once dissemble your disdain,Or listen to the Siren's theme,Or stoop to love, since now esteem,And confidence, and friendship, is no more.II.Yet tell me Phaedria! tell me why,When summoning your pride, you tryTo meet her looks with cool neglect,Or cross her walk with slight respect,(For so is falsehood best repaid)Whence do your cheeks indignant glow?Why is your struggling tongue so slow?What means that darkness on your brow?As if with all her broken vowYou meant the fair apostate to upbraid?ODE V. AGAINST SUSPICION.I.On fly! it is dire Suspicion's mien,And meditating plagues unseenThe sorc'ress hither bends;Behold her torch in gall imbru'd,Behold—her garment drops with bloodOf lovers and of friends.II.Fly far! already in your eyesI see a pale suffusion rise;And soon thro' ev'ry vein,Soon will her secret venom spread,And all your heart and all your headImbibe the potent stain.III.Then many a demon will she raiseTo vex your sleep, to haunt your ways,While gleams of lost delightRaise the dark tempest of the brain,As lightning shines across the mainThro' whirlwinds and thro' night.IV.No more can Faith or Candour move,But each ingenuous deed of loveWhich Reason would applaudNow smiling o'er her dark distressFancy malignant strives to dressLike Injury and Fraud.V.Farewell to Virtue's peaceful times;Soon will you stoop to act the crimesWhich thus you stoop to fear.Guilt follows guilt; and where the trainBegins with wrongs of such a stainWhat horrours form the rear!VI.'Tis thus to work her baleful pow'rSuspicion waits the sullen hourOf fretfulness and strife,When care th' infirmer bosom wrings,Or Eurus waves his murky wingsTo damp the seats of life.VII.But come, forsake the scene unblestWhich first beheld your faithful breastTo groundless fears a prey;Come where with my prevailing lyreThe skies, the streams, the groves, conspireTo charm your doubts away.VIII.Thron'd in the Sun's descending carWhat pow'r unseen diffuseth farThis tenderness of mind?What genius smiles on yonder flood?What god in whispers from the woodBids ev'ry thought be kind?IX.O thou! whate'er thy awful name,Whose wisdom our untoward frameWith social love restrains;Thou! who by fair affection's tiesGiv'st us to double all our joysAnd half disarm our pains;X.Let universal candour still,Clear as yon' heav'n-reflecting rill,Preserve my open mind,Nor this nor that man's crooked waysOne sordid doubt within me raiseTo injure humankind.ODE VI. HYMN TO CHEERFULNESS.How thick the shades of ev'ning close!How pale the sky with weight of snows!Haste, light the tapers, urge the fire,And bid the joyless day retire.—Alas! in vain I try withinTo brighten the dejected scene;While rous'd by grief these fiery painsTear the frail texture of my veins,While Winter's voice that storms around,And yon' deep death-bell's groaning sound,Renew my mind's oppressive gloomTill starting Horrour shakes the room.Is there in Nature no kind pow'rTo sooth Affliction's lonely hour?To blunt the edge of dire disease,And teach these wintry shades to please?
Come, Cheerfulness! triumphant Fair!Shine thro' the hov'ring cloud of care:O sweet of language, mild of mien!O Virtue's friend, and Pleasure's queen!Assuage the flames that burn my breast,Compose my jarring thoughts to rest,And while thy gracious gifts I feelMy song shall all thy praise reveal.As once (it was in Astrea's reign)The vernal pow'rs renew'd their train,It happen'd that immortal LoveWas ranging thro' the spheres above,And downward hither cast his eyeThe year's returning pomp to spy.He saw the radiant god of DayWaft in his car the rosy May;The fragrant Airs and genial HoursWere shedding round him dews and flow'rs;Before his wheels Aurora past,And Hesper's golden lamp was last:But fairest of the blooming throngWhen Health majestick mov'd along,Delighted to survey belowThe joys which from her presence flow,While earth enliven'd hears her voice,And swains, and flocks, and fields, rejoice,Then mighty Love her charms confest,And soon his vows inclin'd her breast,
And known from that auspicious mornThe pleasing Cheerfulness was born.Thou, Cheerfulness! by Heav'n design'dTo sway the movements of the mind,Whatever fretful passion springs,Whatever wayward fortune bringsTo disarrange the pow'r withinAnd strain the musical machine,Thou, Coddess! thy attemp'ring handDoth each discordant string command,Refines the soft and swells the strong,And joining Nature's gen'ral songThro' many a varying tone unfoldsThe harmony of human souls.Fair Guardian of domestick life!Kind Banisher of homebred strife!Nor sullen lip nor taunting eyeDeforms the scene where thou art by;No sick'ning husband damns the hourWhich bound his joys to female pow'r;No pining mother weeps the caresWhich parents waste on thankless heirs;Th' officious daughters pleas'd attend,The brother adds the name of friend:By thee with flow'rs their board is crown'd,With songs from thee their walks resound,And morn with welcome lustre shines,And ev'ning unperceiv'd declines.Is there a youth whose anxious heartLabours with love's unpity'd smart?Tho' now he stray by rills and bow'rs,And weeping waste the lonely hours,Or if the nymph her audience deignDebase the story of his painWith slavish looks, discolour'd eyes,And accents falt'ring into sighs,Yet thou, auspicious Pow'r! with easeCanst yield him happier arts to please,Inform his mien with manlier charms,Instruct his tongue with nobler arms,With more commanding passion move,And teach the dignity of love.Friend to the Muse and all her train!For thee I court the Muse again;The Muse for thee may well exertHer pomp, her charms, her fondest art,Who owes to thee that pleasing swayWhich earth and peopled heav'n obey.Let Melancholy's plaintive tongueRepeat what later bards have sung,But thine was Homer's ancient might,And thine victorious Pindar's flight;Thy hand each Lesbian wreath attir'd,Thy lips Sicilian reeds inspir'd;Thy spirit lent the glad perfumeWhence yet the stow'rs of Teos bloom,
Whence yet from Tibur's Sabine valeDelicious blows th' enliv'ning gale,While Horace calls thy sportive choir,Heroes and nymphs, around his lyre.But see where yonder pensive sage(A prey perhaps to Fortune's rage,Perhaps by tender griefs opprest,Or glooms congenial to his breast)Retires in desert scenes to dwell,And bids the joyless world farewell:Alone he treads th' autumnal shade,Alone beneath the mountain laidHe sees the nightly damps ascendAnd gath'ring storms aloft impend,He hears the neighb'ring surges roll,And raging thunders shake the pole,Then struck by ev'ry object round,And stunn'd by ev'ry horrid sound,He asks a clue for Nature's ways,But evil haunts him thro' the maze;He sees ten thousand demons riseTo wield the empire of the skies,And Chance and Fate assume the rod,And Malice blot the throne of God.—O thou! whose pleasing pow'r I sing,Thy lenient influence hither bring,Compose the storm, dispel the gloom,Till Nature wear her wonted bloom
Till fields and shades their sweets exhale,And musick swell each op'ning gale;Then o'er his breast thy sostness pour,And let him learn the timely hourTo trace the world's benignant laws,And judge of that Presiding CauseWho founds on discord Beauty's reign,Converts to pleasure ev'ry pain,Subdues each hostile form to rest,And bids the universe be blest.O thou! whose pleasing pow'r I sing,If right I touch the votive string,If equal praise I yield thy name,Still govern thou thy poet's flame,Still with the Muse my bosom share,And sooth to peace intruding care;But most exert thy pleasing pow'rOn friendship's consecrated hour,And while my Sophron points the roadTo godlike Wisdom's calm abode,Or warm in freedom's ancient causeTraceth the source of Albion's laws,Add thou o'er all the gen'rous toilThe light of thy unclouded smile.But if by Fortune's stubborn swayFrom him and friendship torn away,I court the Muse's healing spellFor griefs that still with absence dwell,
Do thou conduct my fancy's dreamsTo such indulgent placid themesAs just the struggling breast may cheer,And just suspend the starting tear,Yet leave that sacred sense of woWhich none but friends and lovers know.ODE VII. ON THE USE OF POETRY.I.NOT for themselves did humankindContrive the parts by Heav'n assign'dOn life's wide scene to play:Not Scipio's force nor Caesar's skillCan conquer glory's arduous hillIf Fortune close the way.II.Yet still the self-depending soul,Tho' last and least in Fortune's roll,His proper sphere commands,And knows what Nature's seal bestow'd,And sees before the throne of GodThe rank in which he stands.III.Who train'd by laws the future age,Who rescu'd nations from the rageOf partial factious pow'r,
My heart with distant homage views,Content if thou, celestial Muse!Didst rule my natal hour.IV.Not far beneath the hero's feetNor from the legislator's seatStands far remote the bard:Tho' not with publick terrours crown'dYet wider shall his rule be found,More lasting his award.V.Lycurgus fashion'd Sparta's fame,And Pompey to the Roman nameGave universal sway.Where are they?—Homer's rev'rend pageHolds empire to the thirtieth age,And tongues and climes obey.VI.And thus when William's acts divineNo longer shall from Bourbon's lineDraw one vindictive vow,When Sidney shall with Cato rest,And Russel move the patriot's breastNo more than Brutus now;VII.Yet then shall Shakespeare's pow'rful artO'er ev'ry passion ev'ry heartConfirm his awful throne;
Tyrants shall bow before his laws,And freedom's, glory's, virtue's, causeTheir dread assertor own.ODE VIII. ON LEAVING HOLLAND.I. 1.FAREWELL to Leyden's lonely bound,The Belgian Muse's sober seat,Where dealing frugal gifts aroundTo all the fav'rites at her feetShe trains the body's bulky frameFor passive persevering toils;And lest from any prouder aimThe daring mind should scorn her homely spoils,She breathes maternal fogs to damp its restless flame.I. 2.Farewell the grave pacifick airWhere never mountain zephir blew,The marshy levels lank and bareWhich Pan which Ceres never knew,The Naiads with obscene attireUrging in vain their urns to flow,While round them chant the croking choir,And haply sooth some lover's prudent wo,Or prompt some restive bard and modulate his lyre,I. 3.Farewell ye Nymphs! whom sober care of gainSnatch'd in your cradles from the god of Love;She render'd all his boasted arrows vain,And all his gifts did he in spite remove:Ye too, the slow-ey'd Fathers of the land!With whom dominion steals from hand to hand,Unown'd, undignify'd by publick choice,I go where Liberty to all is known,And tells a monarch on his throneHe reigns not but by her preserving voice.II. 1.O my lov'd England! when with theeShall I sit down to part no more?Far from this pale discolour'd seaThat sleeps upon the reedy shore,When shall I plough thy azure tide?When on thy hills the flocks admire,Like mountain snows, till down their sideI trace the village and the sacred spire,While bow'rs and copses green the golden slope divide?II. 2.Ye Nymphs who guard the pathless grove,Ye Blueey'd Sisters of the streams!With whom I wont at morn to rove,With whom at noon I talk'd in dreams,O take me to your haunts again,
The rocky spring the greenwood glade,To guide my lonely footsteps deign,To prompt my slumbers in the murm'ring shade,And sooth my vacant ear with many an airy strain!II. 3.And thou, my faithful Harp! no longer mournThy drooping master's inauspicious hand;Now brighter skies and fresher gales return,Now fairer maids thy melody demand.Daughters of Albion! listen to my lyre:O Phoebus! guardian of th'Aonian choir,Why sounds not mine harmonious as thy own,When all the virgin deities aboveWith Venus and with Juno moveIn concert round th' Olympian Father's throne?III. 1.Thee too, Protectress of my lays,Elate with whose majestick callAbove degen'rate Latium's praise,Above the slavish boast of Gaul,I dare from impious thrones reclaimAnd wanton Sloth's ignoble charmsThe honours of a poet's name,To Somers' counsels or to Hamden's armsThee, Freedom! I rejoin, and bless thy genuine flame.III. 2.Great Citizen of Albion! theeHeroick Valour still attends,
And useful Science, pleas'd to seeHow Art her studious toil extends,While Truth diffusing from on highA lustre unconfin'd as dayFills and commands the publick eye,Till pierc'd and sinking by her pow'rful rayTame Faith and monkish Awe like nightly demons fly.III. 3.Hence the whole land the patriot's ardour shares,Hence dread Religion dwells with social Joy,And holy passions and unsully'd caresIn youth, in age, domestick life employ.O fair Britannia! hail!—With partial loveThe tribes of men their native seats approve,Unjust and hostile to each foreign fame;But when for gen'rous minds and manly lawsA nation holds her prime applauseThere publick zeal shall all reproof disclaim.ODE IX. TO CURIOSee The Epistle to Curio in this volume., MDCCXLIV.I.THRICE hath the spring beheld thy faded fameSince I exulting grasp'd the tuneful shell,Eager thro' endless years to sound thy name,Proud that my memory with thine should dwell,
How hast thou stain'd the splendour of my choice!Those godlike forms which hover'd round thy voice,Laws, Freedom, Glory, whither are they flown?What can I now of thee to time reportSave thy fond Country made thy impious sport,Her fortune and her hope the victims of thy own?II.There are with eyes unmov'd and reckless heartWho saw thee from thy summit fall thus low,Who deem'd thy arm extended but to dartThe publick vengeance on thy private foe:But spite of ev'ry gloss of envious minds,The owl-ey'd race whom virtue's lustre blinds,Who sagely prove that each man hath his price,I still believ'd thy aim from blemish free,I yet, ev'n yet, believe it spite of theeAnd all thy painted pleas to greatness and to vice.III."Thou didst not dream of Liberty decay'd,"Nor wish to make her guardian laws more strong,"But the rash many first by thee misled"Bore thee at length unwillingly along."Rise from your sad abodes ye curst of oldFor faith deserted or for cities sold!Own here one untry'd unexampled deed,One mystery of shame from Curio learn,To beg the infamy he did not earn,And 'scape in Guilt's disguise from Virtue's offer'd meed.IV.For saw we not that dang'rous pow'r avow'dWhom Freedom oft' hath found her mortal bane,Whom Publick Wisdom ever strove t' exclude,And but with blushes suff'reth in her train?Corruption vaunted her bewitching spoils,O'er court o'er senate spread in pomp her toils,And call'd herself the states directing soul,Till Curio like a good magician try'd,With Eloquence and Reason at his side,By strength of holier spells th' enchantress to control.V.Soon with thy country's hope thy fame extends;The rescu'd merchant oft' thy words resounds:Thee and thy cause the rural hearth defends;His bowl to thee the grateful sailor crowns:The learn'd recluse with awful zeal who readOf Grecian heroes Roman patriots dead,Now with like awe doth living merit scan,While he whom virtue in his blest retreatBad social ease and publick passions meetAscends the civil scene, and knows to be a man.VI.At length in view the glorious end appear'd,We saw thy spirit thro' the senate reign,And Freedom's friends thy instant omen heardOf laws for which their fathers bled in vain.
Wak'd in the strise the publick Genius roseMore keen, more ardent, from his long repose;Deep thro' her bounds the City felt his call;Each crowded haunt was stirr'd beneath his pow'r,And murm'ring challeng'd the deciding hourOf that too vast event the hope and dread of all.VII.O ye good Pow'rs who look on humankind!Instruct the mighty moments as they rowl,And watch the fleeting shapes in Curio's mind,And steer his passions steady to the goal.O Alfred! father of the English name,O valiant Edward! first in civil fame,O William! height of publick virtue pure,Bend from your radiant seats a joyful eye,Behold the sum of all your labours nigh,Your plans of law complete, your ends of rule secure.VIII.'Twas then—O shame! O soul from faith estrang'd!O Albion! oft' to flatt'ring vows a prey,'Twas then—thy thought what sudden frenzy chang'd?What rushing palsy took thy strength away?Is this the man in freedom's cause approv'd,The man so great, so honour'd, so belov'd,Whom the dead envy'd and the living blest,This patient slave by tinsel bonds allur'd,This wretched suitor for a boon abjur'd,Whom those that fear'd him scorn, that trusted him detest?IX.O lost alike to action and repose!With all that habit of familiar fameSold to the mock'ry of relentless foes,And doom'd t' exhaust the dregs of life in shame,To act with burning brow and throbbing heartA poor deserter's dull exploded part,To slight the favour thou canst hope no more,Renounce the giddy crowd, the vulgar wind,Charge thy own lightness on thy Country's mind,And from her voice appeal to each tame foreign shore.X.But England's sons to purchase thence applauseShall ne'er the loyalty of slaves pretend,By courtly passions try the publick cause,Nor to the forms of rule betray the end.O Race erect! by manliest passions mov'd,The labours which to Virtue stand approv'dPrompt with a lover's fondness to survey,Yet where Injustice works her wilful claimFierce as the flight of Jove's destroying flame,Impatient to confront and dreadful to repay.XI.These thy heart owns no longer. In their roomSee the grave queen of pageants, Honour, dwellCouch'd in thy bosom's deep tempestuous gloomLike some grim idol in a sorc'rer's cell:Before her rites thy sick'ning reason flew,Divine Persuasion from thy tongue withdrew,
While Laughter mock'd or Pity stole a sigh.Can Wit her tender movements rightly frameWhere the prime function of the foul is lame?Can Fancy's feeble springs the force of truth supply?XII.But come; it is time; strong destiny impendsTo shut thee from the joys thou hast betray'd:With princes fill'd the solemn fane ascendsBy Infamy the mindful demon sway'd;There vengeful vows for guardian laws essac'd,From nations fetter'd and from towns laid waste,For ever thro' the spacious courts resound;There long Posterity's united groan,And the sad charge of horrours not their own,Assail the giant chiefs and press them to the ground.XIII.In sight old Time, imperious judge! awaits:Above revenge, or fear, or pity, justHe urgeth onward to those guilty gatesThe Great, the Sage, the Happy, and August,And still he asks them of the hidden planWhence ev'ry treaty ev'ry war began,Evolves their secrets and their guilt proclaims,And still his hands despoil them on the roadOf each vain wreath by lying bards bestow'd,And crush their trophies huge and raze their sculptur'd names.XIV.Ye mighty Shades! arise, give place, attend;Here his eternal mansion Curio seeks;—Low doth proud Wentworth to the stranger bend,And his dire welcome hardy Clifford speaks:"He comes whom Fate with surer arts prepar'd"T' accomplish all which we but vainly dar'd,"Whom o'er the stubborn herd she taught to reign,"Who sooth'd with gaudy dreams their raging pow'r"Even to its last irrevocable hour,"Then baffled their rude strength and broke them to the chain."XV.But ye whom yet wise Liberty inspires,Whom for her champions o'er the world she claims,(That household godhead whom of old your siresSought in the woods of Elbe and bore to Thames)Drive ye this hostile omen far away;Their own fell efforts on her foes repay;Your wealth, your arts, your fame, be her's alone:Still gird your swords to combat on her side,Still frame your laws her gen'rous test t' abide,And win to her defence the altar and the throne.XVI.Protect her from yourselves ere yet the floodOf golden luxury which commerce poursHath spread that selfish fierceness thro' your bloodWhich not her lightest discipline endures:Snatch from fantastick demagogues her cause;

TO THE MUSE.I.QUEEN of my songs, harmonious Maid!Ah! why hast thou withdrawn thy aid?Ah! why forsaken thus my breast,With inauspicious damps opprest?Where is the dread prophetick heatWith which my bosom wont to beat?Where all the bright mysterious dreamsOf haunted groves and tuneful streamsThat woo'd my genius to divinest themes?II.Say, Goddess! can the festal board,Or young Olympia's form ador'd,Say, can the pomp of promis'd fameRelume thy faint thy dying flame?Or have melodious airs the pow'rTo give one free poetick hour?Or from amid th' Elysian trainThe soul of Milton shall I gainTo win thee back with some celestial strain?III.O pow'rful strain! O sacred soul!His numbers ev'ry sense control:And now again my bosom burns;The Muse, the Muse herself, returns!Such on the banks of Tyne confestI hail'd the fair immortal guestWhen first she seal'd me for her own,Made all her blissful treasures known,And bad me swear to follow her alone.ODE XI. ON LOVE. TO A FRIEND.I.NO, foolish Youth!—To virtuous fameIf now thy early hopes be vow'd,If true ambition's nobler flameCommand thy footsteps from the crowd,Lean not to Love's enchanting snare;His songs, his words, his looks, beware,Nor join his votaries the young and fair.II.By thought, by dangers, and by toils,The wreath of just renown is worn;Nor will Ambition's awful spoilsThe flow'ry pomp of Ease adorn;
But love unbends the force of thought,By love unmanly fears are taught,And love's reward with gaudy sloth is bought.III.Yet thou hast read in tuneful lays,And heard from many a zealous breast,The pleasing tale of Beauty's praiseIn Wisdom's lofty language drest;Of Beauty pow'rful to impartEach finer sense each comelier art,And sooth and polish man's ungentle heart.IV.If then from Love's deceit secureThus far alone thy wishes tend,Go see the white-wing'd ev'ning hourOn Delia's vernal walk descend;Go while the golden light serene,The grove, the lawn, the soften'd scene,Becomes the presence of the rural queen.V.Attend while that harmonious tongueEach bosom each desire commands:Apollo's lute by Hermes strung,And touch'd by chaste Minerva's hands,Attend. I feel a force divine,O Delia! win my thoughts to thine;That half the colour of thy life is mine.VI.Yet conscious of the dang'rous charmSoon would I turn my steps away,Nor oft' provoke the lovely harm,Nor lull my reason's watchful sway:But thou, my Friend!—I hear thy sighs;Alas! I read thy downcast eyes,And thy tongue salters and thy colour flies.VII.So soon again to meet the fair?So pensive all this absent hour?—O yet, unlucky Youth! bewareWhile yet to think is in thy pow'r.In vain with friendship's flatt'ring nameThy passion veils its inward shame,Friendship, the treach'rous fuel of thy flame!VIII.Once I remember, new to Love,And dreading his tyrannick chain,I sought a gentle maid, to proveWhat peaceful joys in friendship reign,Whence we forsooth might safely stand,And pitying view the lovesick band,And mock the winged boy's malicious hand.IX.Thus frequent past the cloudless day,To smiles and sweet discourse resign'd,
While I exulted to surveyOne gen'rous woman's real mind,Till friendship soon my languid breastEach night with unknown cares possest,Dash'd my coy slumbers or my dreams distrest.X.Fool that I was!—And now, ev'n now,While thus I preach the Stoick strain,Unless I shun Olympia's viewAn hour unsays it all again.O Friend!—when Love directs her eyesTo pierce where ev'ry passion liesWhere is the firm, the cautious, or the wise?ODE XII. TO SIR FRANCIS HENRY DRAKE, BARONET.I.BEHOLD! the Balance in the skySwift on the wintry scale inclines,To earthy caves the Dryads fly,And the bare pastures Pan resigns.Late did the farmer's fork o'erspreadWith recent soil the twice-mown mead,Tainting the bloom which autumn knows;He whets the rusty coulter now,He binds his oxen to the plough,And wide his future harvest throws.II.Now London's busy confines round,By Kensington's imperial tow'rs,From Highgate's rough descent profound,Essexian heaths or Kentish bow'rs,Where'er I pass I see approachSome rural statesman's eager coach,Hurry'd by senatorial cares,While rural nymphs (alike withinAspiring courtly praise to win)Debate their dress, reform their airs.III.Say, what can now the country boastO Drake! thy footsteps to detain,When peevish winds and gloomy frostThe sunshine of the temper stain?Say, are the priests of Devon grownFriends to this tolerating throne,Champions for George's legal right?Have gen'ral freedom, equal law,Won to the glory of NassauEach bold Wessexian squire and knight?IV.I doubt it much, and guess at leastThat when the day which made us freeShall next return, that sacred feastThou better may'st observe with me:
With me the sulph'rous treason oldA far inferiour part shall holdIn that glad day's triumphal strain,And gen'rous William be rever'd,Nor one untimely accent heardOf James or his ignoble reign.V.Then while the Gascon's fragrant wineWith modest cups our joy suppliesWe 'll truly thank the pow'r divineWho bad the chief the patriot rise;Rise from heroick case, (the spoilDue for his youth's Herculean toil,From Belgium to her saviour son)Rise with the same unconquer'd zealFor our Britannia's injur'd weal,Her laws defac'd her shrines o'erthrown.VI.He came: the tyrant from our shoreLike a forbidden demon fled,And to eternal exile borePontifick rage and vassal dread:There sunk the mould'ring Gothick reign;New years came forth, a lib'ral train!Call'd by the people's great decree.That day, my Friend! let blessings crown:—Fill to the demigod's renownFrom whom thou hast that thou art free.VII.Then, Drake! (for wherefore should we partThe publick and the private weal?)In vows to her who sways thy heartFair health, glad fortune, will we deal;Whether Aglaia's blooming cheek,Or the soft ornaments that speakSo eloquent in Daphne's smile,Whether the piercing lights that flyFrom the dark heav'n of Myrto's eyeHaply thy fancy then beguile.VIII.For so it is; thy stubborn breast,Tho' touch'd by many a slighter wound,Hath no full conquest yet confest,Nor the one fatal charmer found;While I, a true and loyal swain,My fair Olympia's gentle reignThro' all the varying seasons own:Her genius still my bosom warms,No other maid for me hath charms,Or I have eyes for her alone.ODE XIII. ON LYRICK POETRY.I. 1.ONCE more I join the Thespian choirAnd taste th' inspiring fount again;
O parent of the Grecian lyreAdmit me to thy pow'rful strain!—And lo! with ease my step invadesThe pathless vale and op'ning shades,Till now I spy her verdant seat;And now at large I drink the soundWhile these her offspring list'ning roundBy turns her melody repeat.I. 2.I see Anacreon smile and sing,His silver tresses breathe perfume,His cheek displays a second springOf roses taught by wine to bloom.Away, deceitful Cares! away,And let me listen to his lay;Let me the wanton pomp enjoyWhile in smooth dance the light-wing'd HoursLead round his lyre its patron pow'rs,Kind Laughter and convivial Joy.I. 3.Broke from the fetters of his native land,Devoting shame and vengeance to her lords,With louder impulse and a threat'ning handThe Lesbian patriotAlcaeus. smites the sounding chords.Ye wretches! ye perfidious train!Ye ours'd of gods and freeborn men!

Thy strings adapt their vary'd strainTo ev'ry pleasure ev'ry painWhich mortal tribes were born to prove,And straight our passions rise or fall,As at the wind's imperious callThe ocean swells the billows move.III. 3.When Midnight listens o'er the slumb'ring earthLet me, O Muse! thy solemn whispers hear,When Morning sends her fragrant breezes forthWith airy murmurs touch my op'ning ear;And ever watchful at thy sideLet Wisdom's awful suff'rage guideThe tenour of thy lay:To her of old by Jove was giv'nTo judge the various deeds of earth and heav'n:'Twas thine by gentle arts to win us to her sway.IV. 1.Oft' as to wellearn'd ease resign'dI quit the maze where Science toils,Do thou retresh my yielding mindWith all thy gay delusive spoils;But O! indulgent, come not nighThe busy steps the jealous eyeOf wealthy Care or gainful Age,Whose barren souls thy joys disdain,And hold as foes to Reason's reignWhome'er thy lovely works engage.IV. 2.When iendship and when letter'd MirthHaply partake my simple board,Then let thy blameless hand call forthThe musick of the Teian chord;Or if invok'd at softer hours,O seek with me the happy bow'rsThat hear Olympia's gentle tongue:To Beauty link'd with Virtue's train,To Love devoid of jealous pain,There let the Sapphick lute be strung.IV. 3.But when from envy and from death to claimA hero bleeding for his native land,When to throw incense on the Vestal flameOf Liberty my genius gives command,Nor Theban voice nor Lesbian lyreFrom thee O Muse! do I require,While my presaging mind,Conscious of pow'rs she never knew,Astonish'd grasps at things beyond her view,Nor by another's fate submits to be confin'd.ODE XIV.

And catch the pearly show'rs,Or brush the mildew from the woods,Or paint with noontide beams the buds,Or breathe on op'ning flow'rs.VI.Such rites which they with spring renewThe eyes of Care can never view,And care hath long been mine;And hence offended with their guestSince grief of love my soul opprestThey hide their toils divine.VII.But soon shall thy enliv'ning tongueThis heart by dear affliction wrungWith noble hope inspire;Then will the sylvan pow'rs againReceive me in their genial trainAnd listen to my lyre.VIII.Beneath yon' Dryad's lonely shadeA rustick altar shall be paidOf turf with laurel fram'd.And thou th' inscription wilt approve,"This for the peace which lost by love"By friendship was reclaim'd."ODE XV. TO THE EVENING STAR.I.TO-NIGHT retir'd the queen of Heav'nWith young Endymion stays;And now to Hesper is it giv'nA while to rule the vacant sky,Till she shall to her lamp supplyA stream of brighter rays.II.O Hesper! while the starry throngWith awe thy path surrounds,Oh! listen to my suppliant song,If haply now the vocal sphereCan suffer thy delighted earTo stoop to mortal sounds.III.So may the bridegroom's genial strainThee still invoke to shine,So may the bride's unmarry'd trainTo Hymen chant their flatt'ring vow,Still that his lucky torch may glowWith lustre pure as thine.IV.Far other vows must I preferTo thy indulgent pow'r:Alas! but now I paid my tearOn fair Olympia's virgin tomb,And lo! from thence in quest I roamOf Philomela's bow'r.V.Propitious send thy golden rayThou purest light above;Let no false flame seduce to strayWhere gulf or steep lie hid for harm.But lead where musick's healing charmMay sooth afflicted love.VI.To them by many a grateful songIn happier season, vow'dThese lawns, Olympia's haunt, belong;Oft' by yon' silver stream we walk'd,Or fix'd while Philomela talk'dBeneath yon' copses stood.VII.Nor seldom where the beechen boughsThat roofless tow'r invadeWe came while her enchanting MuseThe radiant moon above us held,Till by a clam'rous owl compell'dShe fled the solemn shade.VIII.But hark!

TO THE RIGHT HON. FRANCIS EARL OF HUNTINGDON, MDCCXLVII.I. 1.THE wise and great of ev'ry climeThro' all the spacious walks of TimeWhere'er the Muse her pow'r display'dWith joy have listen'd and obey'd;For taught of Heav'n the sacred NinePersuasive numbers forms divineTo mortal sense impart:
They best the soul with glory fire,They noblest counsels boldest deeds inspire,And high o'er Fortune's rage inthrone the fixed heart.I. 2.Nor less prevailing is their charmThe vengeful bosom to disarm,To melt the proud with human wo,And prompt unwilling tears to flow.Can wealth a pow'r like this afford?Can Cromwell's arts or Marlb'rough's swordAn equal empire claim?No, Hastings! thou my words wilt own;Thy breast the gifts of ev'ry Muse hath known,Nor shall the giver's love disgrace thy noble name.I. 3.The Muse's awful art,And the blest function of the poet's tongue,Ne'er shalt thou blush to honour, to assertFrom all that scorned Vice or slavish Fear hath sung,Nor shall the blandishment of Tuscan strings,Warbling at will in Pleasure's myrtle bow'r,Nor shall the servile notes to Celtick kings,By flatt'ring minstrels paid in evil hour,Move thee to spurn the heav'nly Muse's reign:A diff'rent strainAnd other themesFrom her prophetick shades and hallow'd streams
(Thou well canst witness) meet the purg'd ear,Such as when Greece to her immortal shellRejoicing listen'd godlike sounds to hear,To hear the sweet instructress tell(While men and heroes throug'd around)How life its noblest use may find,How well for freedom be resign'd,And how by Glory Virtue shall be crown'd.II. 1.Such was the Chian father's strainTo many a kind domestick train,Whose pious hearth and genial bowlHad cheer'd the rev'rend pilgrim's soul,When ev'ry hospitable riteWith equal bounty to requiteHe struck his magick strings,And pour'd spontaneous numbers forth,And seiz'd their ears with tales of ancient worth,And fill'd their musing hearts with vast heroick things.II 2.Stanza II. 2.] Lycurgus, the Lacedaemonian lawgiver, brought into Greece from Asia Minor the first complete copy of Homer's Works.—At Plataea was fought the decifive battle between the Persian army and the united militia of Greece under Pausanias and Aristides.—Cimon the Athenian erected a trophy in Cyprus for two great victories gained on the same day over the Persians by sea and land. Diodorus Siculus has preserved the inscription which the Athenians affixed to the consecrated spoils after this great success, in which it is very remarkable that the greatness of the occasion has raised the manner of expression above the usual simplicity and modesty of all other ancient inscriptions. It is this;

The following translation is almost literal;
Since first the sea from Asia's hostile coastDivided Europe, and the god of WarAssail'd imperious cities, never yetAt once among the waves and on the shoreHath such a labour been achiev'd by menWho earth inhabit. They whose arms the MesIn Cyprus felt pernicious, they the sameHave won from skilful Tyre an hundred shipsCrowded with warriours. Asia groans, in bothHer hands  smitten by the might of war.Now oft' where happy spirits dwell,Where yet he tunes his charming shell,
Oft' near him with applauding handsThe Genius of his country stands;
To list'ning gods he makes him known,That man divine by whom were sownThe seeds of Grecian fame,Who first the race with freedom fir'dFrom whom Lycurgus Sparta's sons inspir'd,From whom Placaean palms and Cyprian trophies came.II. 3.Stanza II. 3.] Pindar was contemporary with Aristides and Cimon, in whom the glory of ancient Greece was at its height. When Xerxes invaded Greece Pindar was true to the common interest of his country, though his fellow-citizens the Thebans had sold themselves to the Persian king. In one of his odes he expresses the great distress and anxiety of his mind occasioned by the vast preparations of Xerxes against Greece, (Isthm. viii.) in another he celebrates the victories of Salamis, Plataea, and Himera, (Pyth. i.) It will be necessary to add two or three other particulars of his life, real or fabulous, in order to explain what follows in the text concerning him. First, then, he was thought to be so great a favourite of Apollo that the priests of that deity allotted him a constant share of their offerings. It was said of him as of some other illustrious men, that at his birth a swarm of bees lighted on his lips and fed him with their honey: it was also a tradition concerning him that Pan was heard to recite his poetry, and seen dancing to one of his hymns on the mountains near Thebes. But a real historical fact in his life is, that the Thebans imposed a large fine upon him on account of the veneration which he expressed in his poems for that heroick spirit shewn by the people of Athens in defence of the common liberty which his own fellow-citizens had shamefully betrayed; and as the argument of this ode implies that great poetical talents and high sentiments of liberty do reciprocaily produce and assist each other, so Pindar is perhaps the most exemplary proof of this connexion which occurs in history. The Thebans were remarkable in general for a slavish disposition through all the fortunes of their commonwealth at the time of its ruin by Philip, and even in its best state under the administration of Pelopidas and Epaminondas; and every one knows they were no less remarkable for great dulness and want of all genius. That Pindar should have equally distinguished himself from the rest of his fellow-citizens in both these respects seems somewhat extraordinary, and is scarce to be accounted for but by the preceding observation.O noblest happiest ageWhen Aristides rul'd and Cimon sought,
When all the gen'rous fruits of Homer's pageExulting Pindar saw to full perfection brought!O Pindar! ost' shalt thou be hail'd of me;Not that Apollo fed thee from his shrine,Not that thy lips drank sweetness from the bee,Nor yet that studious of thy notes divinePan danc'd their measure with the sylvan throng,But that thy songWas proud t' unfoldWhat thy base rulers trembled to behold,Amid corrupted Thebes was proud to tellThe deeds of Athens and the Persian shame,Hence on thy head their impious vengeance fell.But thou, O faithful to thy fame!The Muse's law didst rightly know,That who would animate his lays,And other minds to virtue raise,Must feel his own with all her spirit glow.III. 1.Are there approv'd of later timesWhose verse adorn'd a tyrant'sOctavianus Caesar. crimes,Who saw majestick Rome betray'dAnd lent th' imperial ruffian aid?Alas! not one polluted bard,No, not the strains that Mincius heardOr Tibur's hills reply'd,Dare to the Muse's ear aspire,Save that instructed by the Grecian lyreWith freedom's ancient notes their shameful task they hide.III. 2.Mark how the dread Pantheon standsAmid the domes of modern hands,Amid the toys of idle state,How simply, how severely great!Then turn, and while each western climePresents her tuneful sons to TimeSo mark thou Milton's name,And add, "Thus dissers from the throng"The spirit which inform'd thy awsul song,"Which bad thy potent voice protect thy country's same."III. 3.Stanza III. 3.] Alluding to his Defence of the People of England against Salmasius. See particularly the manner in which he himself speaks of that undertaking in the Introduction to his Reply to us.Yet hence barbarick ZealHis mem'ry with unholy rage pursues,
While from these arduous cares of publick wealShe bids each bard begone, and rest him with his Muse.O Fool! to think the man whose ample mindMust grasp at all that yonder stars survey,Must join the noblest forms of ev'ry kindThe world's most perfect image to display,Can 'er his country's majesty beholdUnmov'd or cold;O fool! to deemThat he whose thought must visit ev'ry theme,Whose heart must ev'ry strong emotion know,Inspir'd by Nature or by Fortune taught,That he, if haply some presumptuous foeWith false ignoble science fraughtShall spurn at Freedom's faithful band,That he their dear desence will shun,Or hide their glories from the sun,Or deal their vengeance with a woman's hand.IV. 1.I care not that in Arno's plainOr on the sportive banks of SeineFrom publick themes the Muses' quireContent with polish'd Ease retire.Where priests studious head command,Where tyrants bow the warlike handTo vile Ambition's aim,Say, what can publick themes assordSave venal honours to an hateful lord,Reserv'd for angry Heav'n and scorn'd of honest Fame?IV. 2.But here, where Freedom's equal throneTo all her valiant sons is known,Where all are conscious of her carcs,And each the pow'r that rules him shares,Here let the bard whose dastard tongueLeaves publick arguments unsungBid publick praise farewell,Let him to fitter climes remove,Far from the hero's and the patriot's love,And lull mysterious monks to slumber in their cell.IV. 3.Stanza.

Thus alone tho' strains divineInform the bosom of the Muse's son,Tho' with new honours the Patrician's lineAdvance from age to age, yet thus aloneThey win the suffrage of impartial Fame.The poet's nameHe best shall proveWhose lays the soul with noblest passions move:
But thee, O Progeny of heroes old!Thee to severer toils thy fate requires;The fate which form'd thee in a chosen mould,The grateful country of thy sires,Thee to sublimer paths demand,Sublimer than thy sires could traceOr thy own Edward teach his raceTho' Gaul's proud Genius sank beneath his hand.V. 1.From rich domains and subject farmsThey led the rustick youth to arms,And kings their stern achievements fear'dWhile private strife their banners rear'd:But loftier scenes to thee are shown,Where empire's wide establish'd throneNo private master fills,Where long foretold the people reigns,Where each a vassal's humble heart disdains,And judgeth what he sees, and as he judgeth wills.V. 2.Here be it thine to calm and guideThe swelling Democratick tide,To watch the state's uncertain frame,And baffle Faction's partial aim,But chiefly with determin'd zealTo quell that servile band who kneelTo Freedom's banish'd soes,
That monster which is daily foundExpert and bold thy country's peace to wound,Yet dreads to handle arms nor manly counsel knows.V. 3.Stanza V. 3.] At Whittington, a village on the edge of Scarsdale in Derbyshire, the Earls of Devonshire and Danby, with the Lord Delamere, privately concerted the plan of the Revolution. The house in which they met is at present a farmhouse, and the country people distinguish the room where they sat by the name of The Plotting Parlour.'Tis highest Heav'ns commandThat guilty aims should sordid paths pursue,That what ensnares the heart should maim the hand,And Virtue's worthless foes be false to glory too.But look on Freedom: see thro' ev'ry ageWhat labours, perils, griefs, hath she disdain'd!What arms, what regal pride, what priestly rage,Have her dread offspring conquer'd or sustain'd!For Albion well have conquer'd. Let the strainsOf happy swainsWhich now resoundWhere Scarsdale's cliffs the swelling pastures boundBear witness: there oft' let the farmer hailThe sacred orchard which imbow'rs his gate,And shew to strangers passing down the valeWhere Cav'ndish, Booth, and Osborne, satWhen bursting from their country's chainEv'n in the midst of deadly harms,Of papal snares and lawless arms,They plann'd for Freedom this her noblest reign.VI. 1.This reign, these laws, this publick care,Which Nassau gave us all to share,Had ne'er adorn'd the English nameCould Fear have silenc'd Freedom's claim:But Fear in vain attempts to bindThose lofty efforts of the mindWhich social good inspires;Where men for this assault a throneEach adds the common welfare to his ownAnd each unconquer'd heart the strength of all acquires.VI. 2.Say, was it thus when late we view'dOur fields in civil blood imbru'd?When Fortune crown'd the barb'rous host,And half th' astonish'd isle was lost?Did one of all that vaunting trainWho dare affront a peaceful reign,Durst one in arms appear?Durst one in counsels pledge his life,Stake his luxurious fortunes in the strife,Or lend his boasted name his vagrant friends to cheer?VI. 3.Yet, Hastings! these are theyWho challenge to themselves thy country's love;The true, the constant, who alone can weighWhat glory should demand or liberty approve.But let their works declare them. Thy free pow'rs,The gen'rous pow'r of thy prevailing mind,
Not for the tasks of their confed'rate hours,Lewd brawls and lurking slander, were design'd.Be thou thy own approver. Honest praiseOft' nobly swaysIngenuous youth;But sought from cowards and the lying mouthPraise is reproach. Eternal God aloneFor mortals fixeth that sublime award:He from the faithful records of his throneBids the historian and the bardDispose of honour and of scorn,Discern the patriot from the slave,And write the good, the wise, the braveFor lessons to the multitude unborn.END OF BOOK FIRST.ODES ON SEVERAL SUBJECTS.

And say, ye skilful in the human heart!Who know to prize a poet's noblest part,What age, what clime, could e'er an ampler fieldFor lofty thought for daring fancy yield?I saw this England break the shameful bandsForg'd for the souls of men by sacred hands,I saw each groaning realm her aid implore,Her sons the heroes of each warlike shore,Her naval standard (the dire Spaniard's bane)Obey'd thro' all the circuit of the main;Then too great Commerce for a late-found worldAround your coast her eager sails unfurl'd;New hopes new passions thence the bosom ir'd,New plans new arts the genius thence inspir'd,Thence ev'ry scence which private fortune knowsIn stronger life with bolder spirit rose.Disgrac'd I this full prospect which I drew,My colours languid or my strokes untrue?Have not your sages, warriours, swains, and kings,Confess'd the living draught of men and things?What other bard in any clime appearsAlike the master of your smiles and tears?Yet have I deign'd your audience to enticeWith wretched bribes to luxury and vice?Or have my various scenes a purpose knownWhich Freedom, Virtue, Glory, might not own?Such from the first was my dramatick plan;It should be yours to crown what I began:
And now that England spurns her Gothick chain,And equal laws and social science reign,I thought now surely shall my zealous eyesView nobler bards and juster criticks rise,Intent with learned labour to refineThe copious ore of Albion's native mine,Our stately Muse more graceful airs to teach,And form her tongue to more attractive speech,Till rival nations listen at her feet,And own her polish'd as they own'd her great.But do you thus my fav'rite hopes fulfil?Is France at last the standard of your skill?Alas for you that so betray a mindOf art unconscious and to beauty blind!Say, does her language your ambition raise,Her barren, trivial, unharmonious, phrase,Which fetters eloquence to scantiest bounds,And maims the cadence of poetick sounds?Say, does your humble admiration chuseThe gentle prattle of her Comick Muse,While wits, plaindealers, fops, and fools, appear,Charg'd to say nought but what the king may hear?Or rather melt your sympathizing heartsWon by her Tragick scenes' romantick arts,Where old and young declaim on soft desire,And heroes never but for love expire?No: tho' the charms of novelty a whilePerhaps too fondly win your thoughtless smile,
Yet not for you design'd indulgent FateThe modes or manners of the Bourbon state;And ill your minds my partial judgment reads,And many an augury my hope misleads,If the fair maids of yonder blooming trainTo their light courtship would an audience deign,Or those chaste matrons a Parisian wifeChuse for the model of domestick life,Or if one youth of all that gen'rous band,The strength and splendour of their native land,Would yield his portion of his country's same,And quit old Freedom's patrimonial claim,With lying smiles Oppression's pomp to see,And judge of glory by a king's decree.O blest at home with justly envy'd laws!O long the chiefs of Europe's gen'ral cause!Whom Heav'n hath chosen at each dang'rous hourTo check the inroads of barbarick Pow'r,The rights of trampled nations to reclaim,And guard the social world from bonds and shame,Oh! let not Luxury's fantastick charmsThus give the lie to your heroick arms,Nor for the ornaments of life embraceDishonest lessons from that vaunting raceWhom Fate's dread laws, (for in eternal FateDespotick Rule was heir to Freedom's hate)Whom in each warlike each commercial part,In civil counsel and in pleasing art,
The Judge of earth predestin'd for your foes,And made it same and virtue to oppose.ODE II. TO SLEEP.I.THOU silent Pow'r! whose welcome swayCharms ev'ry anxious thought away,In whose divine oblivion drown'dSore pain and weary toil grow mild,Love is with kinder looks beguil'd,And Grief forgets her fondly-cherish'd wound,Oh whither hast thou flown, indulgent God!God of kind shadows and of healing dews,Whom dost thou touch with thy Lethaean rod?Around whose temples now thy opiate airs diffuse?II.Lo! Midnight from her starry reignLooks awful down on earth and main,The tuneful birds lie hush'd in sleep,With all that crop the verdant food,With all that skim the crystal floodOr haunt the caverns of the rocky steep;No rushing winds disturb the tufted bow'rs,No wakeful sound the moonlight valley knowsSave where the brook its liquid murmur pours,And lulls the waving scene to more profound repose.III.Oh let not me alone complain,Alone invoke thy pow'r in vain!Descend propitious on my eyes,Not from the couch that bears a crown,Not from the courtly statesman's down,Nor where the miser and his treasure lies;Bring not the shapes that break the murd'rer's rest,Nor those the hireling soldier loves to see,Nor those which haunt the bigot's gloomy breast;Far be their guilty nights and far their dreams from me!IV.Nor yet those awful forms presentFor chiefs and heroes only meant.The figur'd brass, the choral song,The rescu'd people's glad applause,The list'ning senate, and the lawsFix'd by the counsels of Timoleon'sAfter Timoleon had delivered Syracuse from the tyranny of Dionysius the people on every important deliberation sent for him into the publick assembly, asked his advice, and voted according to it. P. tongue,Are scenes too grand for Fortune's private ways,And tho' they shine in youth's ingenuous viewThe sober gainful arts of modern daysTo such romantick thoughts have bid a long adieu.V.I ask not, god of Dreams! thy careTo banish Love's presentments fair:
Nor rosy cheek nor radiant eyeCan arm him with such strong commandThat the young sorc'rer's fatal handShould round my soul his pleasing fetters tie:Nor yet the courtier's hope, the giving smile,(A lighter phantom and a baser chain)Did e'er in slumber my proud lyre beguileTo lend the pomp of thrones her ill-according strain.VI.But, Morpheus! on thy balmy wingSuch honourable visions bringAs sooth'd great Milton's injur'd ageWhen in prophetick dreams he sawThe race unborn with pious aweImbibe each virtue from his heav'nly page;Or such as Mead's benignant fancy knowsWhen health's deep treasures by his art explor'dHave sav'd the infant from an orphan's woesOr to the trembling sire his age's hope restor'd.ODE III. TO THE CUCKOO.I.O Rustick herald of the spring!At length in yonder woody valeFast by the brook I hear thee sing,And studious of thy homely tale
Amid the vespers of the grove,Amid the chanting choir of love,Thy sage responses hail.II.The time has been when I have frown'dTo hear thy voice the woods invade,And while thy solemn accent drown'dSome sweeter poet of the shadeThus thought I, thus the sons of CareSome constant youth or gen'rous fairWith dull advice upbraid.III.I said "While Philomela's song"Proclaims the passion of the grove"It ill beseems a Cuckoo's tongue"Her charming language to reprove."—Alas! how much a lover's earHates all the sober truth to hear,The sober truth of love!IV.When hearts are in each other blest,When nought but lofty faith can ruleThe nymph's and swain's consenting breast,How Cuckoolike in Cupid's schoolWith store of grave prudential sawsOn Fortune's pow'r and Custom's lawsAppears each friendly fool!V.Yet think betimes, ye gentle Train!Whom love, and hope, and fancy, sway,Who ev'ry harsher care disdain,Who by the morning judge the day,Think that in April's fairest hoursTo warbling shades and painted flow'rsThe Cuckoo joins his lay.ODE IV. TO THE HON. CHARLES TOWNSHEND, In the Country, 1750.I. 1.How oft' shall I surveyThis humble roof, the lawn, the greenwood shade,The vale with sheaves o'erspread,The glassy brook, the flocks which round thee stray?When will thy cheerful mindOf these have utter'd all her dear esteem?Or tell me dost thou deemNo more to join in glory's toilsome race,But here content embraceThat happy leisure which thou hadst resign'd?I. 2.Alas! ye happy hoursWhen books and youthful sport the soul could shareEre one ambitious careOf civil life had aw'd her simpler pow'rs,
Oft' as your winged trainRevisit here my friend in white arrayOh! fail not to displayEach fairer scene where I perchance had partThat so his gen'rous heartTh' abode of even Friendship may remain.I. 3.For not imprudent of my loss to comeI saw from Contemplation's quiet cellHis feet ascending to another homeWhere publick Praise and envy'd Greatness dwell.But shall we therefore, O my Lyre!Reprove Ambition's best desire,Extinguish Glory's flame?Far other was the task enjoin'dWhen to my hand thy strings were first assign'd,Far other faith belongs to Friendship's honour'd name.II. 1.Thee Townshend! not the armsOf slumb'ring Ease nor Pleasure's rosy chainWere destin'd to detain;No, nor bright Science, nor the Muse's charms.For them high Heav'n preparesTheir proper votaries, an humbler band:And ne'er world Spenser's handHave deign'd to strike the warbling Tuscan shell,Nor Harrington to tellWhat habit an immortal city wears,II. 2Had this been born to shieldThe cause which Cromwell's impious hand betray'd,Or that like Vere diiplay'dHis Redcross banner o'er the Belgian field;Yet where the will divineHsth shut those loftiest paths, it next remainsWith reason clad in strainsOf harmony selected minds t' inspire,And Virtue's living fireTo feed and eternize in hearts like thine.II. 3.For never shall the herd whom Envy swaysSo quell my purpose or my tongue controlThat I should fear illustrious worth to praiseBecause its master's friendship mov'd my soul.Yet if this undissembling strainShould now perhaps thine ear detainWith any pleasing sound,Remember thou that righteous FameFrom hoary Age a strict account will claimOf each auspicious palm with which thy youth was crown'd.III. 1.Nor obvious is the wayWhere Heav'n expects thee, nor the traveller leadsThro' flow'rs or fragrant meadsOr groves that hark to Philomela's lay.The impartial laws of Fate
To nobler virtues wed severer cares.Is there a man who sharesThe summit next where heav'nly natures dwell?Ask him (for he can tell)What storms beat round that rough laborious height.III. 2.Ye Heroes! who of oldDid gen'rous England Freedom's throne ordainFrom Alfred's parent reignTo Nassau, great deliv'rer wise and bold!I know your perils hard,Your wounds, your painful marches, wintry seas,The night estrang'd from ease,The day by cowardice and falsehood vex'd,The head with doubt perplex'd,Th' indignant heart disdaining the rewardIII. 3.Which Envy hardly grants. But, O renown!O praise from judging Heav'n and virtuous menIf thus they purchas'd thy divinest crownSay, who shall hesitate or who complain?And now they sit on thrones above,And when among the gods they moveBefore the Sovran Mind,"Lo! these," he saith, "Lo! these are they"Who to the laws of mine eternal sway"From violence and fear asserted humankind."IV. 1.Thus honour'd while the trainOf legislators in his presence dwell,If I may aught foretelThe statesman shall the second palm obtain.For dreadful deeds of armsLet vulgar bards with undiscerning praiseMore glitt'ring trophies raise,But wisest Heav'n what deeds may chiefly moveTo favour and to love;What save wide blessings or averted harms?IV. 2.Nor to th' embattled fieldShall these achievments of the peaceful gownThe green immortal crownOf valour or the songs of conquest yield.Not Fairfax wildly bold,While bare of crest he hew'd his fatal wayThro' Naseby's firm arrayTo heavier dangers did his breast opposeThan Pym's free virtue choseWhen the proud force of Strafford he controll'd.IV. 3.But what is man at enmity with truth?What were the fruits of Wentworth's copious mindWhen (blighted all the promise of his youth)The patriot in a tyrant's league had join'd?
Let Ireland's loud lamenting plains,Let Tyne's and Humber's trampled swains,Let menac'd London, tellHow impious Guile made Wisdom base,How gen'rous Zeal to cruel Rage gave place,And how unbless'd he liv'd and how dishonour'd fell.V. 1.Thence never hath the MuseAround his tomb Pierian roses flung,Nor shall one poet's tongueHis name for musick's pleasing labour chuse.And sure when Nature kindHath deck'd some favour'd breast above the throng,That man with grievous wrongAffronts and wounds his genius if he bendsTo Guilt's ignoble endsThe functions of his ill-submitting mind.V. 2.For worthy of the wiseNothing can seem but virtue, nor earth yieldTheir fame an equal fieldSave where impartial Freedom gives the prize:There Somers fix'd his name,Enroll'd the next to William; there shall TimeTo ev'ry wond'ring climePoint out that Somers who from Faction's crowd,The sland'rous and the loud,Could fair assent and modest rev'rence claim.V. 3.Nor aught did laws or social arts acquire,Nor this majestick weal of Albion's landDid aught accomplish or to aught aspireWithout his guidance, his superiour hand.And rightly shall the Muse's careWreaths like her own for him prepare,Whose mind's enamour'd aimCould forms of civil beauty drawSublime as ever sage or poet saw,Yet still to life's rude scene the proud ideas tame.VI. 1.Let none profane be near!The Muse was never foreign to his breast;On Pow'r's grave seat confestStill to her voice he bent a lover's ear:And if the blessed knowTheir ancient cares, ev'n now th' unfading grovesWhere haply Milton rovesWith Spenser, hear th' enchanted echoes roundThro' farthest heav'n resoundWise Somers! guardian of their fame below.VI. 2.He knew, the patriot knew,That letters and the Muses' pow'rful artExalt th' ingenuous heartAnd brighten ev'ry form of just and true:
They lend a nobler swayTo civil Wisdom than Corruption's lureCould ever yet procure;They too from Envy's pale malignant lightConduct her forth to sightCloth'd in the fairest colours of the day.VI. 3.O Townshend! thus may Time, the judge severe,Instruct my happy tongue of thee to tell,And when I speak of one to freedom dearFor planning wisely and for acting well,Of one whom glory loves to own,Who still by lib'ral means aloneHath lib'ral ends pursu'd,Then for the guerdon of my lay"This man with faithful friendship," will I say,"From youth to honour'd age my arts and me hath view'd."ODE V. ON LOVE OF PRAISE.I.OF all the springs within the mindWhich prompt her steps in Fortune's mazeFrom none more pleasing aid we findThan from the genuine love of praise.II.Nor any partial private endSuch rev'rence to the publick bears,Nor any passion, Virtue's friend,So like to Virtue's self appears.III.For who in glory can delightWithout delight in glorious deeds?What man a charming voice can slightWho courts the echo that succeeds?IV.But not the echo on the voiceMore than on virtue praise depends,To which of course its real priceThe judgment of the praiser lends.V.If praise then with religious aweFrom the sole perfect Judge be sought,A nobler aim, a purer law,Nor priest, nor bard, nor sage, hath taught;VI.With which in character the same,Tho' in an humbler sphere it lies,I count that soul of human fameThe suffrage of the good and wise.ODE VI. TO W. HALL, ESQ. WITH THE WORKS OF CHAULIEU.I.ATTEND to Chaulieu's wanton lyreWhile fluent as the skylark singsWhen first the morn allures its wingsThe epicure his theme pursues,And tell me if among the choirWhose musick charms the banks of SeineSo full, so free, so rich, a strainE'er dictated the warbling Muse.II.Yet, Hall! while thy judicious earAdmires the welldissembled artThat can such harmony impartTo the lame pace of Gallick rhymes,While wit from affectation clearBright images and passions trueRecall to thy assenting viewThe envy'd bards of nobler times;III.Say, is not oft' his doctrine wrong?This priest of Pleasure, who aspiresTo lead us to her sacred fires,Knows he the ritual of her shrine?Say, (her sweet influence to thy song
So may the goddess still afford)Doth she consent to be ador'dWith shameless love and frantick wine?IV.Nor Cato nor Chrysippus hereNeed we in high indignant phraseFrom their Elysian quiet raise,But Pleasure's oracle aloneConsult attentive, not severe.O Pleasure! we blaspheme not thee,Nor emulate the rigid kneeWhich bends but at the Stoick throne.V.We own had Fate to man assign'dNor sense nor wish but what obeyOr Venus soft or Bacchus gay,Then might our bard's voluptuous creedMost aptly govern humankind,Unless perchance what he hath sungOf tortur'd joints and nerves unstrungSome wrangling heretick should plead.VI.But now with all these proud desiresFor dauntless truth and honest fame,With that strong master of our frameTh' inexorable judge within,What can be done? Alas! ye firesOf love! alas! ye rosy smiles!
Ye nectar'd cups from happier soils!—Ye have no bribe his grace to win.ODE VII. TO THOMAS EDWARDS, ESQ. On the late Edition of Mr. Pope's Works, 1751.I.BELIEVE me, Edwards! to restrainThe licence of a railer's tongueIs what but seldom men obtainBy sense or wit, by prose or song;A task for more Herculean pow'rs,Nor suited to the sacred hoursOf leisure in the Muses' bow'rs.II.In bow'rs where laurel weds with palmThe Muse, the blameless queen, resides,Fair Fame attends, and Wisdom calmHer eloquence harmonious guides,While shut for ever from her gateOft' trying still repining waitFierce Envy and calumnious Hate.III.Who then from her delightful boundsWould step one moment forth to heedWhat impotent and savage soundsFrom their unhappy mouths proceed?
No; rather Spenser's lyre againPrepare, and let thy pious strainFor Pope's dishonour'd shade complain.IV.Tell how displeas'd was ev'ry bardWhen lately in th' Elysian groveThey of his Muse's guardian heard,His delegate to fame above,And what with one accord they saidOf Wit in drooping age misled,And Warburton's officious aid:V.Stanza V.] During Mr. Pope's war with Theobald, Concanen, and the rest of their tribe, Mr. Warburton, the present Lord Bishop of Gloucester, did with great zeal cultivate their friendship, having been introduced forsooth at the meetings of that respectable confederacy, a favour which he afterwards spoke of in very high terms of complacency and thankfulness: at the same time in his intercourse with them he treated Mr. Pope in a most contemptuous manner, and as a writer without genius. Of the truth of these assertions his Lordship can have no doubt if he recollects his own correspondence with Concanen, a part of which is still in being, and will probably be remembered as long as any of this prelate's writings.How Virgil mourn'd the sordid fateTo that melodious lyre assign'd,Beneath a tutor who so lateWith Midas and his rout combin'dBy spiteful Clamour to confoundThat very lyre's enchanting sound,Tho' list'ning realms admir'd around:VI.How Horace own'd he thought the fireOf his friend Pope's satirick lineDid farther fuel scarce requireFrom such a militant divine:How Milton scorn'd the sophist vainWho durst approach his hallow'd strainWith unwash'd hands and lips profane.VII.Then Shakespeare debonnair and mildBrought that strange Comment forth to view;"Conceits more deep," he said and smil'd,"Than his own fools or madmen knew;"But thank'd a gen'rous friend aboveWho did with free advent'rous loveSuch pageants from his tomb remove.VIII.And if to Pope in equal needThe same kind office thou wouldst pay,Then, Edwards! all the band decreedThat future bards with frequent layShould call on thy auspicious nameFrom each absurd intruder's claimTo keep inviolate their fame.ODE VIII. TO THE AUTHOR OF MEMOIRS OF THE HOUSE OF BRANDENBURGH, 1751In the year 1751 appeared a very splendid edition in 4to of Memoires pour servir a l'Histoire de la Maison de Brandebourg, a Berlin et la Haye, with a privilege signed Frederick, the same being engraved in imitation of handwriting. In this edition among other extraordinary passages are the two following, to which the third stanza of this ode more particularly refers:Page 163.] "Il se fit une migration [the author is speaking of what happened of the revocation of the Edict of Nantz] dont on n'avoit guere vu d'exemples dans l'histoire: un peuple entier sortit du royaume par l'esprit de parti en haine du pape, et pour recevoir sous un autre ciel la communion sous les deux especes: quatre cens mille ames s'expatrierent ainsi et abandonnerent tous leur biens pour detonne dans d'autres temples les vieuxpseaumesde Clement Marot."Page 242.] "La crainte donna le jour a la credulite, et l'amour propre interessa bientot le ciel au destin des hommes.".I.THE men renow'd as chiefs of human race,And born to lead in counsels or in arms,Have seldom turn'd their feet from Glory's chaseTo dwell with books or court the Muse's charms:Yet to our eyes if haply time hath broughtSome genuine transcript of their calmer thought,There still we own the wise, the great, or good,And Caesar there and Xenophon are seenAs clear in spirit and sublime of mienAs on Pharsalian plains or by th'Assyrian slood.II.Say thou too, Fred'rick! was not this thy aim?Thy vigils could the student's lamp engageExcept for this? except that future fameMight read thy genius in the faithful page?That if hereafter Envy shall presumeWith words irrev'rent to inscribe thy tomb,And baser weeds upon thy palms to fling,That hence posterity may try thy reign,Assert thy treaties, and thy wars explain,And view in native lights the hero and the king.III.O evil foresight and pernicious care!Wilt thou indeed abide by this appeal?Shall we the lessons of thy pen compareWith private honour or with publick zeal?Whence then at things divine those darts of scorn?Why are the woes which virtuous men have borneFor sacred Truth a prey to Laughter giv'nWhat fiend, what foe of Nature, urg'd thy armTh' Almighty of his sceptre to disarm,To push this earth adrist and leave it loose from heav'n?IV.Ye godlike Shades of legislators old!Ye who made Rome victorious Athens wise!Ye first of mortals, with the blest enroll'd!Say, did not horrour in your bosoms riseWhen thus by impious Vanity impell'dA magistrate, a monarch, ye beheld
Affronting civil Order's holiest bands,Those bands which ye so labour'd to improve.Those hopes and fears of justice from aboveWhich tam'd the savage world to your divine commands?ODE IX. TO THE RIGHT REV. BENJAMIN LORD BISHOP OF WINCHESTER, 1754.I. 1.FOR toils which patriots have endur'd,For treason quell'd and laws secur'd,In ev'ry nation Time displaysThe palm of honourable praise.Envy may rail and Faction fierceMay strive; but what, alas! can those(Tho' bold yet blind and sordid foes)To gratitude and love oppose,To faithful story and persuasive verse?I. 2.O Nurse of freedom, Albion! say,Thou tamer of despotick sway,What man among thy sons aroundThus heir to glory hast thou found?What page in all thy annals brightHast thou with purer joy survey'dThan that where truth by Hoadley's aidShines thro' imposture's solemn shade,Thro' kingly and thro' sacerdotal night?I. 3.To him the Teacher blestWho sent religion from the palmy fieldBy Jordan like the morn to cheer the west,And lifted up the veil which Heav'n from earth conceal'd,To Hoadley thus his mandate he addrest;"Go thou and rescue my dishonour'd law"From hands rapacious and from tongues impure;"Let not my peaceful name be made a lure"Fell Persecution's mortal snares to aid,"Let not my words be impious chains to draw"The freeborn soul in more than brutal awe,"To faith without assent, allegiance unrepaid."II. 1.Stanza II. 1.] Mr. Locke died in 1704, when Mr. Hoadley was beginning to distinguish himself in the cause of civil and religious liberty, Lord Godolphin in 1712, when the doctrines of the Jacobite faction were chiefly favoured by those in power, Lord Somers in 1716, amid the practices of the Nonjuring clergy against the Protestant establishment, and Lord Stanhope in 1721, during the controversy with the lower ouse of Convocation.No cold or unperforming handWas arm'd by Heav'n with this command:The world soon felt it; and on highTo William's ear with welcome joyDid Locke among the blest unfoldThe rising hope of Hoadley's name,Godolphin then confirm'd the fame,And Somers when from earth he came,And gen'rous Stanhope, the fair sequel told.II. 2.Then drew the lawgivers around,(Sires of the Grecian name renown'd)And list'ning ask'd and wond'ring knewWhat private force could thus subdueThe vulgar and the great combin'd,Could war with sacred folly wage,Could a whole nation disengageFrom the dread bonds of many an ageAnd to new habits mould the publick mind.II. 3.For not a conqueror's swordNor the strong pow'rs to civil founders knownWere his, but truth by faithful search explor'dAnd social sense like seed in genial plenty sown.Wherever it took root the soul (restor'dTo freedom) freedom too for others sought.Not monkish craft, the tyrant's claim divine,Not regal zeal, the bigot's cruel shrine,Could longer guard from Reason's warfare sage;Not the wild rabble to sedition wrought,Nor synods by the papal Genius taught,Nor St. John's spirit loose nor Atterbury's rage.III. 1.But where shall recompense be found,Or how such arduous merit crown'd?
For look on life's laborious sceneWhat rugged spaces he betweenAdvent'rous Virtue's early toilsAnd her triumphal throne! the shadeOf death mean-time does oft' invadeHer progress, nor to us display'dWears the bright heroine her expected spoils.III. 2.Yet born to conquer is her pow'r:—O Hoadley! if that fav'rite hourOn earth arrive, with thankful aweWe own just Heav'n's indulgent law,And proudly thy success behold;We attend thy rev'rend length of daysWith benediction and with praise,And hail thee in our publick waysLike some great spirit fam'd in ages old.III. 3.While thus our vows prolongThy steps on earth, and when by us resign'dThou join'st thy seniors, that heroick throngWho rescu'd or preserv'd the rights of humankind,O! not unworthy may thy Albion's tongueThee still her friend and benefactor name;O! never, Hoadley! in thy country's eyesMay impious gold or pleasure's gaudy prizeMake publick tue, publick freedom vile,
Nor our own manners tempt us to disclaimThat heritage, our noblest wealth and same,Which thou hast kept entire from force and factious guile.ODE X.I.IF rightly tuneful bards decide,If it be fix'd in Love's decreesThat beauty ought not to be try'dBut by its native pow'r to please,Then tell me, Youths and Lovers! tellWhat fair can Amoret excel?II.Behold that bright unfully'd smile,And Wisdom speaking in her mien,Yet (she so artless all the while,So little studious to be seen)We nought but instant gladness know,Nor think to whom the gift we owe.III.But neither musick nor the pow'rsOf youth, and mirth, and frolick cheer,Add half that sunshine to the hours,Or make life's prospect half so clear,As mem'ry brings it to the eyeFrom scenes where Amoret was by.IV.Yet not a satirist could thereOr fault or indiscretion find,Nor any prouder sage declareOne virtue pictur'd in his mindWhose form with lovelier colours glowsThan Amoret's demeanour shows.V.This sure is beauty's happiest part,This gives the most unbounded sway,This shall enchant the subject heartWhen rose and lily fade away,And she be still in spite of timeSweet Amoret in all her prime.ODE XI. AT STUDY.I.WHITHER did my fancy stray?By what magick drawn awayHave I left my studious theme,From this philosophick page,From the problems of the sage,Wand'ring thro' a pleasing dream?II.'Tis in vain, alas! I find,Much in vain, my zealous mind
Would to learned Wisdom's throneDedicate each thoughtful hour;Nature bids a softer pow'rClaim some minutes for his own.III.Let the busy or the wiseView him with contemptuous eyes,Love is native to the heart:Guide its wishes as you will,Without love you 'll find it stillVoid in one essential part.IV.Me tho' no peculiar fairTouches with a lover's care,Tho' the pride of my desireAsks immortal Friendship's name,Asks the palm of honest fame,And the old heroick lyre;V.Tho' the day have smoothly gone,Or to letter'd leisure knownOr in social duty spent,Yet at eve my lonely breastSeeks in vain for perfect rest,Languishes for true content.ODE XII. TO THE COUNTRY GENTLEMEN OF ENGLAND, 1758.I.WHITHER is Europe's ancient spirit fled?Where are those valiant tenants of her shoreWho from the warriour-bow the strong dart sped,Or with firm hand the rapid poleaxe bore?Freeman and Soldier was their common nameWho late with reapers to the furrow came,Now in the front of battle charg'd the foe,Who taught the steer the wintry plough t' endure,Now in full councils check'd encroaching pow'r,And gave the guardian laws their majesty to know.II.But who are ye? from Ebro's loit'ring sonsTo Tiber's pageants, to the sports of Seine,From Rhine's frail palaces to Danube's thrones,And cities looking on the Cimbrick main,Ye lost, ye self-deserted! whose proud lordsHave baffled your tame hands, and giv'n you swordsTo slavish ruffians hir'd for their command:These at some greedy monk's or harlot's nodSee rifled nations crouch beneath their rod;These are the publick will, the reason of the land.III.Thou, heedless Albion! what, alas! the whileDost thou presume? O inexpert in arms,Yet vain of freedom, how dost thou beguileWith dreams of hope these near and loud alarms?Thy splendid home, thy plan of laws renown'd,The praise and envy of the nations round,What care hast thou to guard from Fortune's sway?Amid the storms of war how soon may allThe lofty pile from its foundations fall,Of ages the proud toil, the ruin of a day!IV.No; thou art rich, thy streams and fertile valesAdd industry's wise gifts to Nature's store,And ev'ry port is crowded with thy fails,And ev'ry wave throws treasure on thy shore.What boots it? if luxurious plenty charmThy selfish heart from glory, if thy armShrink at the frowns of danger and of pain,Those gifts, that treasure, is no longer thine.Oh! rather far be poor. Thy gold will shineTempting the eye of Force, and deck thee to thy bane.V.But what hath force or war to do with thee?Girt by the azure tide, and thron'd sublimeAmid thy floating bulwarks, thou canst seeWith scorn the fury of each hostile clime
Dash'd ere it reach thee. Sacred from the foeAre thy fair fields. Athwart thy guardian prowNo bold invader's foot shall tempt the strand.—Yet say, my Country! will the waves and windObey thee? hast thou all thy hopes resign'dTo the sky's fickle faith the pilot's wav'ring hand?VI.For oh! may neither fear nor stronger love(Love by thy virtuous princes nobly won)Thee last of many wretched nations moveWith mighty armies station'd round the throneTo trust thy safety. Then farewell the claimsOf Freedom! her proud records to the flamesThen bear, an off'ring at Ambition's shrine,Whate'er thy ancient patriots dar'd demandFrom furious John's or faithless Charles's hand,Or what great William seal'd for his adopted line.VII.But if thy sons be worthy of their name,If lib'ral laws with lib'ral hearts they prize,Let them from conquest and from servile shameIn war's glad school their own protectors rise.Ye chiefly, heirs of Albion's cultur'd plains!Ye leaders of her bold and faithful swains!Now not unequal to your birth be found;The publick voice bids arm your rural state,Paternal hamlets for your ensigns wait,And grange and fold prepare to pour their youth around.VIII.Why are ye tardy? what inglorious careDetains you from their head, your native post?Who most their country's fame and fortune share'Tis theirs to share her toils her perils most.Each man his task in social life sustains:With partial labours with domestick gainsLet others dwell: to you indulgent Heav'nBy counsel and by arms the publick causeTo serve for publick love and love's applause,The first employment far, the noblest hire, hath giv'n.IX.Have ye not heard of Lacedaemon's fame?Of Attick chiefs in Freedom's war divine?Of Rome's dread gen'rals? the Valerian name?The Fabian sons? the Scipios? matchless line!Your lot was theirs. The farmer and the swainMet his lov'd patron's summons from the plain;The legions gather'd; the bright Eagles flew;Barbarian monarchs in the triumph mourn'd,The conq'rors to their household gods return'd,And fed Calabrian flocks, and steer'd the Sabine plough.X.Shall then this glory of the antick age,This pride of men, be lost among mankind?Shall war's heroick arts no more engageThe unbought hand the unsubjected mind?
Doth valour to the race no more belong?No more with scorn of violence and wrongDoth forming Nature now her sons inspire,That like some mystery to few reveal'dThe skill of arms abash'd and aw'd they yield,And from their own defence with hopeless hearts retire?XI.O shame to human life to human laws!The loose advent'rer, hireling of a day,Who his fell sword without affection draws,Whose god whose country is a tyrant's pay,This man the lessons of the field can learn,Can ev'ry palm which decks a warriour earn,And ev'ry pledge of conquest, while in vainTo guard your altars, your paternal lands,Are social arms held out to your free hands!Too arduous is the lore, too irksome were the pain.XII.Mean-time by Pleasure's lying tales allur'dFrom the bright sun and living breeze ye stray,And deep in London's gloomy haunts immur'dBrood o'er your fortune's, freedom's, health's decay.O blind of choice, and to yourselves untrue!The young grove shoots, their bloom the fields renew,The mansion asks its lord, the swains their friend,While he doth Riot's orgies haply share,Or tempt the gamester's dark destroying snare,Or at some courtly shrine with slavish incense bend.XIII.And yet full oft' your anxious tongues complainThat lawless tumult prompts the rustick throng,That the rude village inmates now disdainThose homely ties which rul'd their fathers long.Alas! your fathers did by other artsDraw those kind ties around their simple hearts,And led in other parts their ductile will,By succour, faithful counsel, courteous cheer,Won them the ancient manners to revere,To prize their country's peace, and Heav'n's duerites fulfil.XIV.But mark the judgment of experienc'd Time,Tutor of nations. Doth light discord tearA state, and impotent sedition's crime?The pow'rs of warlike prudence dwell not there,The pow'rs who to command and to obeyInstruct the valiant. There would civil swayThe rising race to manly concord tame,Oft' let the marshall'd field their steps unite,And in glad splendour bring before their sightOne common cause and one hereditary fame.XV.Nor yet be aw'd nor yet your task disownTho' war's proud votaries look on severe,Tho' secrets taught erewhile to them aloneThey deem profan'd by your intruding ear;
Let them in vain your martial hope to quellOf new refinements fiercer weapons tell,And mock the old simplicity in vain:To the time's warfare simple or refin'dThe time itself adapts the warriour's mind,And equal prowess still shall equal palms obtain.XVI.Say then, if England's youth in earlier daysOn Glory's field with well train'd armies vy'd,Why shall they now renounce that gen'rous praise?Why dread the foreign mercenary's pride?Tho' Valois brav'd young Edward's gentle hand,And Albert rush'd on Henry's way-worn band,With Europe's chosen sons in arms renown'd,Yet not on Vere's bold archers long they look'd,Nor Audley's squires nor Mowbray'sycomen brook'd;They saw their standard fall, and left their monarch bound.XVII.Such were the laurels which your fathers won,Such Glory's dictates in their dauntless breast.—Is there no voice that speaks to ev'ry son,No nobler holier call to you addrest?O! by majestick Freedom, righteous Laws,By heav'nly Truth's by manly Reason's cause,
Awake! attend! be indolent no more:By Friendship, social Peace, domestick Love,Rise! arm! your Country's living safety prove,And train her valiant youth, and watch around her shore.ODE XIII.

Being profusely extravagant he soon dissipated a splendid fortune, to supply the want of which he entered into the designs of Caesar against the liberties of his country, altho' he had formerly been a professed enemy to him. Cicero, to whose care he had been committed upon his first entrance into the Forum, exerted himself to prevent his ruin, but without effect, and he became one of the first victims in the Civil war. This Epistle was first published in the 1744, when a celebrated patriot was supposed to have deserted the cause of his country. The Author afterwards transformed it into the Ode to Curio, "a performance disgraceful only to its Author," says a celebrated writer. The Epistle, which is too curious to be omitted, we here give in its original form. The Ode is printed p. 31. of this volume..THRICE has the spring beheld thy faded fameAnd the fourth winter rises on thy shameSince I exulting grasp'd the votive shellIn sounds of triumph all thy praise to tell,Blest could my skill thro' ages make thee shine,And proud to mix my memory with thine.But now the cause that wak'd my song beforeWith praise with triumph crowns the toil no more.If to the glorious man whose faithful cares,Nor quell'd by malice nor relax'd by years,Had aw'd Ambition's wild audacious hate,And dragg'd at length Corruption to her fate,
If ev'ry tongue its large applauses ow'd,And wellearn'd laurels ev'ry Muse bestow'd,If publick justice urg'd the high reward,And Freedom smil'd on the devoted bard,Say then, to him whose levity or lustLaid all a people's gen'rous hopes in dust,Who taught Ambition firmer heights of pow'r,And sav'd Corruption at her hopeless hour,Does not each tongue its execrations owe?Shall not each Muse a wreath of shame bestow?And publick justice fanctify th' award,And Freedom's hand protect th' impartial bard?Yet, long reluctant, I forbore thy name,Long watch'd thy virtue like a dying flame,Hung o'er each glimm'ring spark with anxious eyes,And wish'd and hop'd the light again would rise;Put since thy guilt still more entire appears,Since no art hides, no supposition clears,Since vengeful Slander now too sinks her blast,And the first rage of party-hate is past,Calm as the judge of Truth at length I comeTo weigh thy merits and pronounce thy doom;So may my trust from all reproach be free,And Earth and Time confirm the fair decree!There are who say they view'd without amazeThy sad reverse of all thy former praise,That thro' the pageants of a patriot's nameThey pierc'd the foulness of thy secret aim,
Or deem'd thy arm exalted but to throwThe publick thunder on a private foe;But I, whose soul consented to thy cause,Who felt thy genius stamp its own applause,Who saw the spirits of each glorious ageMove in thy bosom and direct thy rage,I scorn'd th' ungen'rous gloss of slavish minds,The owley'd race whom Virtue's lustre blinds:Spite of the learned in the ways of vice,And all who prove that each man has his price,I still believ'd thy end was just and free,And yet, ev'n yet believe it—spite of thee;Ev'n tho' thy mouth impure has dar'd disclaim,Urg'd by the wretched impotence of shame,Whatever filial cares thy zeal had paidTo laws infirm and liberty decay'd,Has begg'd Ambition to forgive the show,Has told Corruption thou wert ne'er her foe,Has boasted in thy country's awful earHer gross delusion when she held thee dear,How tame she follow'd thy tempestuous call,And heard thy pompous tales, and trusted all.—Rise from your sad abodes ye curst of oldFor laws subverted and for cities sold!Paint all the noblest trophies of your guilt,The oaths you perjur'd and the blood you spilt;Yet must you one untempted vileness own,One dreadful palm reserv'd for him alone;
With study'd arts his country's praise to spurn,To beg the infamy he did not earn,To challenge hate when honour was his due,And plead his crimes where all his virtue knew!Do robes of state the guarded heart encloseFrom each fair feeling human nature knows?Can pompous titles stun th' enchanted earTo all that reason all that sense would hear?Else couldst thou e'er desert thy sacred post,In such unthankful baseness to be lost?Else couldst thou wed the emptiness of vice,And yield thy glories at an idiot's price?When they who loud for liberty and lawsIn doubtful times had fought their country's cause,When now of conquest and dominion sureThey ought alone to hold their fruits secure,When taught by these Oppression hid the faceTo leave Corruption stronger in her place,By silent spells to work the publick fate,And taint the vitals of the passive state,Till healing Wisdom should avail no more,And Freedom loath to tread the poison'd shore,Then like some guardian god that slies to saveThe weary pilgrim from an instant grave,Whom sleeping and secure the guileful snakeSteals near and nearer thro' the peaceful brake,Then Curio rose, toward the publick woTo wake the heedless and incite the slow,
Against Corruption Liberty to arm,And quell th' enchantress by a mightier charm.Swift o'er the land the fair contagion lew,And with thy country's hopes thy honours grew:Thee patriot the Patrician roof confest;Thy pow'rful voice the rescu'd merchant blest;Of thee with awe the rural hearth resounds;The bowl to thee the grateful sailor crowns:Touch'd in the sighing shade with manlier siresTo trace thy steps the lovesick youth aspires;The learn'd recluse who oft' amaz'd had readOf Grecian heroes Roman patriots dead,With new amazement hears a living namePretend to share in such forgotten fame;And he who scorning courts and courtly waysLeft the tame track of these dejected daysThe life of nobler ages to renewIn virtues sacred from a monarch's view,Rous'd by thy labours from the bless'd retreatWhere social ease and publick passions meet,Again ascending treads the civil scene,To act and be a man as thou hadst been.Thus by degrees thy cause superiour grew,And the great end appear'd at last in view;We heard the people in thy hopes rejoice,We saw the senate bending to thy voice;The friends of freedom hail'd th' approaching reignOf laws for which our fathers bled in vain,
While venal Faction struck with new dismayShrunk at their frown, and self-abandon'd lay.Wak'd in the shock the Publick Genius roseAbash'd and keener from his long repose;Sublime in ancient pride he rais'd the spearWhich slaves and tyrants long were wont to fear:The City felt his call; from man to man,From street to street, the glorious horrour ran;Each crowded haunt was stirr'd beneath his pow'r,And murm'ring challeng'd the deciding hour.Lo! the deciding hour at last appears,The hour of ev'ry freeman's hopes and fears!Thou, Genius! guardian of the Roman name,O ever prompt tyrannick rage to tame!Instruct the mighty moments as they rowl,And guide each movement steady to the goal.Ye Spirits! by whose providential artSucceeding motives turn the changeful heart,Keep, keep the best in view to Curio's mind,And watch his fancy and his passions bind!Ye Shades immortal! who by Freedom ledOr in the field or on the scaffold bled,Bend from your radiant seats a joyful eye,And view the crown of all your labours nigh;See Freedom mounting her eternal throne!The sword submitted and the laws her own;See publick Pow'r chastis'd beneath her stands,With eyes intent and uncorrupted hands!
See private life by wisest arts reclaim'd!See ardent youth to noblest manners fram'd!See us acquire whate'er was sought by youIf Curio, only Curio, will be true.'Twas then—O shame! O trust how ill repaid!O Latium! oft' by faithless sons betray'd!—'Twas then—What frenzy on thy reason stole?What spells unsinew'd thy determin'd soul?—Is this the man in Freedom's cause approv'd,The man so great, so honour'd, so belov'd,This patient slave by tinsel chains allur'd,This wretched suitor for a boon abjur'd,This Curio, hated and despis'd by all,Who fell himself to work his country's fall?O lost alike to action and repose!Unknown, unpity'd, in the worst of woes!With all that conscious undissembled prideSold to the insults of a foe defy'd!With all that habit of familiar sameDoom'd to exhaust the dregs of life in shame!The sole sad refuge of thy baffled art,To act a statesman's dull exploded part,Renounce the praise no longer in thy pow'r,Display thy virtue tho' without a dow'r,Contemn the giddy crowd, the vulgar wind,And shut thy eyes that others may be blind.—Forgive me, Romans! that I bear to smileWhen shameless mouths your majesty defile,
Paint you a thoughless, frantick, headlong, crew,And cast their own impieties on you:For witness Freedom! to whose sacred pow'rMy soul was vow'd from reason's earliest hour,How have I stood exulting to surveyMy country's virtues op'ning in thy ray!How with the sons of ev'ry foreign shoreThe more I match'd them honour'd her's the more!O Race erect! whose native strength of soulWhich kings, nor priests, nor sordid laws, control,Bursts the tame round of animal affairs,And seeks a nobler centre for its cares,Intent the laws of life to comprehend,And fix dominion's limits by its end,Who bold and equal in their love or hate,By conscious reason judging ev'ry state,The man forget not tho' in rags he lies,And know the mortal thro' a crown's disguise,Thence prompt alike with witty scorn to viewFastidious Grandeur lift his solemn brow,Or all awake at Pity's soft commandBend the mild ear and stretch the gracious hand,Thence large of heart from envy far remov'd,When publick toils to virtue stand approv'd,Not the young lover fonder to admire,Nor more indulgent the delighted sire,Yet high and jealous of their freeborn nameFierce as the flight of Jove's destroying flame,
Where'er Oppression works her wanton swayProud to confront and dreadful to repay;But if to purchase Curio's sage applauseMy country must with him renounce her cause,Quit with a slave the path a patriot trod,Bow the meek knee and kiss the regal rod,Then still, ye Pow'rs! instruct his tongue to rail,Nor let his zeal nor let his subject fail,Else ere he change the style bear me awayTo where the Gracchi where the BrutiThe two brothers, Tiberius and Caius Gracchus, lost their lives in attempting to introduce the only regulation that could give stability and good order to the Roman republick.  Junius Brutus founded the commonwealth, and died in its defence. stay!O long rever'd and late resign'd to shame!If this uncourtly page thy notice claim,When the loud cares of bus'ness are withdrawn,Nor welldrest beggars round thy footsteps fawn,In that still thoughtful solitary hourWhen Truth exerts her unresisted pow'r,Breaks the false opticks ting'd with Fortune's glare,Unlocks the breast and lays the passions bare,Then turn thy eyes on that important scene,And ask thyself—if all be well within?Where is the heartfelt worth and weight of soulWhich labour could not stop nor fear control?Where the known dignity, the stamp of awe,Which half-abash'd the proud and venal saw?
Where the calm triumphs of an honest cause?Where the delightful taste of just applause?Where the strong reason, the commanding tongue,On which the Senate fir'd or trembling hung?All vanish'd, all are sold!—and in their room,Couch'd in thy bosom's deep distracted gloom,See the pale form of barb'rous Grandeur dwell,Like some grim idol in a sorc'rer's cell!To her in chains thy dignity was led,At her polluted shrine thy honour bled;With blasted weeds thy awful brow she crown'd,Thy pow'rful tongue with poison'd philters bound,That baffled Reason straight indignant flew,And fair Persuasion from her seat withdrew:For now no longer Truth supports thy cause,No longer Glory prompts thee to applause;No longer Virtue breathing in thy breast,With all her conscious majesty confest,Still bright and brighter wakes th' almighty flameTo rouse the feeble and the wilful tame,And where she sees the catching glimpses rowlSpreads the strong blaze and all involves the soul;But cold restraints thy conscious fancy chill,And formal passions mock thy struggling will;Or if thy Genius e'er forget his chain,And reach impatient at a nobler strain,Soon the sad bodings of contemptuous mirthShoot thro' thy breast and stab the gen'rous birth,
Till blind with smart from truth to frenzy tost,And all the tenour of thy reason lost,Perhaps thy anguish drains a real tear,While some with pity some with laughter hear.—Can art, alas! or genius, guide the headWhere truth and freedom from the heart are fled?Can lesser wheels repeat their native strokeWhen the prime function of the soul is broke?But come, unhappy Man! thy sates impend;Come, quit thy friends, if yet thou hast a friend;Turn from the poor rewards of guilt like thine,Renounce thy titles and thy robes resign;For see the hand of Destiny display'dTo shut thee from the joys thou hast betray'd!See the dire fane of Infamy ariseDark as the grave and spacious as the skies,Where from the first of time thy kindred train,The chiefs and princes of th' unjust, remain!Eternal barriers guard the pathless roadTo warn the wand'rer of the curs'd abode,But prone as whirlwinds scour the passive skyThe heights surmounted down the steep they fly.There black with frowns relentless Time awaits,And goads their footsteps to the guilty gates,And still he asks them of their unknown aims,Evolves their secrets and their guilt proclaims,And still his hands despoil them on the roadOf each vain wreath by lying bards bestow'd,
Break their proud marbles, crush their festal cars,And rend the lawless trophies of their wars.At last the gates his potent voice obey,Fierce to their dark abode he drives his prey,Where ever arm'd with adamantine chainsThe watchful demon o'er her vassals reigns,O'er mighty names and giant pow'rs of lust,The Great, the Sage, the Happy, and AugustTitles which have been generally ascribed to the most pernicious of men.;No gleam of hope their baleful mansion cheers,No sound of honour hails their unbless'd cars,But dire reproaches from the friend betray'd,The childless fire and violated maid,But vengeful vows for guardian laws essac'd,From towns enslav'd and continents laid waste,But long Posterity's united groan,And the sad charge of horrours not their own,For ever thro' the trembling space resound,And sink eaxh impious forehead to the ground.Ye mighty foes of Liberty and RestGive way; do homage to a mightier guest!Ye daring Spirits of the Roman race,See Curio's toil your proudest claims efface!—Aw'd at the name fierce AppiusAppius Claudius the Decemvir, and L.

AN ELEGY.Too much my heart of Beauty's pow'r hath known,Too long to Love hath Reason left her throne,Too long my Genius mourn'd his myrtle chain,And three rich years of youth consum'd in vain.My wishes lull'd with soft inglorious dreamsForgot the patriot's and the sage's themes;Thro' each Elysian vale and Fairy grove,Thro' all th' enchanted paradise of Love,Misled by sickly Hope's deceitful flame,Averse to action, and renouncing fame.At last the visionary scenes decay,My eyes exulting bless the newborn dayWhose faithful beams detect the dang'rous roadIn which my heedless feet securely trod,And strip the phantoms of their lying charmsThat lur'd my soul from Wisdom's peaceful arms.For silver streams and banks bespread with flow'rs,For mossy couches and harmonious bow'rs,Lo! barren heaths appear and pathless woods,And rocks hung dreadful o'er unfathom'd floods:For openness of heart, for tender smiles,Looks fraught with love, and wrath-disarming wiles,Lo! sullen Spite and perjur'd Lust of Gain,And cruel Pride and crueller Disdain;Lo! cordial Faith to idiot airs rein'd,Now coolly civil now transporting kind;For graceful Ease, lo! Affectation walks,And dull Half-sense for Wit and Wisdom talks:New to each hour what low delight succeeds,What precious furniture of hearts and heads!By nought their prudence but by getting known,And all their courage in deceiving shown.See next what plagues attend the lover's state,What frightful forms of Terrour, Scorn, and Hate!See burning Fury heav'n and earth defy!See dumb Despair in icy fetters lie!See black Suspicion bend his gloomy brow,The hideous image of himself to view!And fond Belief with all a lover's flameSinks in those arms that points his head with shame!There wan Dejection falt'ring as he goes,In shades and silence vainly seeks repose,Musing thro' pathless wilds consumes the day,Then lost in darkness weeps the hours away.
Here the gay crowd of Luxury advance,Some touch the lyre and others urge the dance;On ev'ry head the rosy garland glows,In ev'ry hand the golden goblet flows,The Siren views them with exulting eyes,And laughs at bashful Virtue as she flies.But see behind where Scorn and Want appear,The grave remonstrance and the witty sneer;See fell Remorse in action prompt to dartHer shaky poison thro' the conscious heart!And Sloth to cancel with oblivious shameThe fair memorial of recording Fame!Are these delights that one would wish to gain?Is this th' Elysium of a sober brain?To wait for happiness in female smiles,Bear all her scorn, be caught with all her wiles,With pray'rs, with bribes, with lies, her pity crave,Bless her hard bonds, and boast to be her slave,To feel for trifles a distracting trainOf hopes and terrours equally in vain,This hour to tremble and the next to glow?Can Pride, can Sense, can Reason, stoop so low,When Virtue at an easier price displaysThe sacred wreaths of honourable praise,When Wisdom utters her divine decreeTo laugh at pompous Folly and be free?I bid adieu then to these woful scenes,I bid adieu to all the sex of queens;
Adieu to ev'ry suff'ring simple soulThat lets a woman's will his ease control.There laugh ye Witty! and rebuke ye Grave!For me I scorn to boast that I'm a slave;I bid the whining brotherhood be gone:Joy to my heart! my wishes are my own.Farewell the female heav'n the female hell,To the great god of Love a glad farewell.Is this the triumph of thy awful name?Are these the splendid hopes that urg'd thy aimWhen first my bosom own'd thy haughty sway,When thus Minerva heard thee boasting say,"Go, martial Maid! elsewhere thy arts employ,"Nor hope to shelter that devoted boy;"Go teach the solemn sons of Care and Age,"The pensive statesmen and the midnight sage;"The young with me must other lessons prove,"Youth calls for Pleasure, Pleasure calls for Love;"Behold his heart thy grave advice disdains,"Behold I bind him in eternal chains?"Alas! great Love, how idle was the boast!Thy chains are broken and thy lessons lost;Thy wilful rage has tir'd my suff'ring heart,And passion, reason, forc'd thee to depart.But wherefore dost thou linger on thy way,Why vainly search for some pretence to stayWhen crowds of vassals court thy pleasing yokeAnd countless victims bow them to the stroke?
Lo! round thy shrine a thousand youths advance,Warm with the gentle ardours of romanceEach longs t' assert th cause with feats of arms,And make the world consess Dulcinea's charms.Ten thousand girls with flow'ry chaplets crown'dTo groves and streams thy tender triumph ound,Each bids the stream in murmurs speak her flame,Each calls the grove to sigh her shepherd's name:But if thy pride such easy honours scorn,If nobler trophies must thy toil adorn,Behold yon' flow'ry antiquated maidBright in the bloom of threescore years display'd,Her shalt thou bind in thy delightful chains,And thrill with gentle pangs her wither'd veins,Her frosty cheek with crimson blushes dye,With dreams of rapture melt her maudlin eye.Turn then thy labours to the servile crowd,Entice the wary and control the proud,Make the sad miser his best gains forego,The solemn statesman sigh to be a beau,The bold coquette with fondest passion burn,The Bacchanalian o'er his bottle mourn,And that chief glory of thy pow'r maintain"To poise ambition in a female brain."Be these thy triumphs, but no more presumeThat my rebellious heart will yield thee room:I know thy puny force thy simple wiles,I break triumphant thro' thy slimsy toils:
I see thy dying lamp's last languid glow,Thy arrows blunted and unbrac'd thy bow;I feel diviner fires my breast inflameTo active science and ingenuous fame,Resume the paths my earliest choice began,And lose with pride the lover in the man.A BRITISH PHILIPPICK, OCCASIONED BY THE INSULTS OF THE SPANIARDS, AND THE PRESENT PREPARATIONS FOR WAR, 1738.WHENCE this unwonted transport in my breast?Why glow my thoughts? and whither would the MuseAspire with rapid wing? Her country's causeDemands her efforts: at that sacred callShe summons all her ardour, throws asideThe trembling lyre, and with the warriour's trumpShe means to thunder in each British ear;And if one spark of honour or of fame,Disdain of insult, dread of infamy,One thought of publick virtue, yet survive,She means to wake it, rouse the gen'rous flame,With patriot zeal inspirit ev'ry breast,And ire each British heart with British wrongs.Alas, the vain attempt! What influence nowCan the Muse boast? or what attention nowIs paid to fame or virtue? Where is nowThe British spirit, gen'rous, warm, and brave,

Yet what need these?My country's fame, my freeborn British heart,Shall be my best inspirers, raise my flightHigh as the Theban's pinion, and with moreThan Greek or Roman flame exalt my soul.Oh! could I give the vast ideas birthExpressive of the thoughts that flame within,No more should lazy Luxury detain
Our ardent youth, no more should Britain's sonsSit tamely passive by, and careless hearThe pray'rs, sighs, groans, (immortal insamy!)Of fellow Britons with oppression sunkIn bitterness of soul demanding aid,Calling on Britain their dear native land,The land of Liberty, so greatly sam'dFor just redress, the land so often dy'dWith her best blood, for that arousing causeThe freedom of her sons; those sons that nowFar from the manly blessings of her swayDrag the vile fetters of a Spanish lord.And dare they, dare the vanquish'd sons of Spain,Enslave a Briton?

MDCCXLVI.The Argument.The Nymphs who preside over springs and rivulets are addressed at daybreak in honour of their several funons, and of the relations which they bear to the natural and to the moral world. Their origin is deduced from the first allegorical deities or powers of Nature, according to the doctrine of the old mythological poets concerning the generation of the gods and the rise of things. They are then successively considered as giving motion to the air and exciting summer breezes; as nourishing and beautifying the vegetable creation; as contributing to the fulness of navigable rivers, and consequently to the maintenance of commerce, and by that means to the maritime part of military per. Next is represented their favourable influence upon health when assisted by rural exercise, which introduces their connexion with the art of physick, and the happy effects of mineral medicinal springs. Lastly, they are celebrated for the friendship which the Muses  them and for the true inspiration which temperance only can receive, in opposition to the enthusiasm of the more licentious poets.O'ER yonder eastern hill the Twilight paleWalks forth from darkness, and the god of DayWith bright Astraea seated by his sideWaits yet to leave the ocean. Tarry, Nymphs!Ye Nymphs! ye blueey'd progeny of Thames!Who now the mazes of this rugged heathTrace with your fleeting steps, who all night longRepeat amid the cool and tranquil airYour lonely murmurs, tarry, and receiveMy offer'd lay. To pay you homage dueI leave the gates of Sleep; nor shall my lyre
Too far into the splendid hours of MornEngage your audience; my observant handShall close the strain ere any sultry beamApproach you: to your subterranean hauntsYe then may timely steal, to pace with careThe humid sands, to loosen from the soilThe bubbling sources, to direct the rillsTo meet in wider channels, or beneathSome grotto's dripping arch at height of noonTo slumber, shelter'd from the burning heav'n.Where shall my song begin ye Nymphs! or end?Wide is your praise and copious.—First of things,First of the lonely pow'rs, ere Time arose,Were Love and Chaos; Love the fire of Fate,℣. 25. —Love—Elder than Chaos.] Hesiod in his Theogony gives a different account, and makes Chaos the eldest of beings, though he assigns to Love neither father nor superiour, which circumstance is particularly mentioned by Phaedrus in Plato's Banquet as being observable not only in Hesiod but in all other writers both of verse and prose, and on the same occasion he cites a line from Parmenides, in which Love is expressly styled the eldest of all the gods. Yet Aristophanes, in The Birds, affirms that "Chaos and Night, and Erebus and Tartarus, were first, and that Love was produced from an egg which the sable-winged Night deposited in the immense bosom of Erebus." But it must be observed that the Love designed by this comick poet was always distinguished from the other, from that original and selfexistent being the ΤΟ ΟΝ or ΑΓΑΘΟΝ of Plato, and meant only the ΔΗΜΙΟΥΡΓΟΣ or second person of the old Grecian trinity, to whom is inscribed an hymn among those which pass under the name of Orpheus, where he is called Protogonos, or the First-begotten, is said to have been born of an egg, and is represented as the principal or origin of all these external appearances of Nature. In the Fragments of Orpheus collected by Henry Stephens he is named Phanes, the Discoverer or Discloser, who unfolded the ideas of the Supreme Intelligence, and exposed them to the perception of inferiour beings in this visible frame of the world, as Mocrobius, and Proclus, and Athenagoras, all agree to interpret the several passages of Orpheus which they have preserved.But the Love designed in our text is the one selfexistent and Infinite Mind, whom if the generality of ancient mythologists have not introduced or truly described in accounting for the production of the world and its appearances, yet to a modern poet it can be no objection that he hath ventured to differ from them in this particular, though in other respects he professeth to imitate their manner and conform to their opinions; for in these great points of natural theology they differ no less remarkably among themselves, and are perpetually confounding the philosophical relations of things with the traditionary circumstances of mythick history; upon which very account Callimachus in his Hymn to Jupiter declareth his dissent from them concerning even an article of the national creed, adding that the ancient bards were by no means to be depended on. And yet in the exordium of the old Argonautick poem ascribed to Orpheus it is said that "Love, whom mortals in later times call Phanes, was the father of the eternally begotten Night," who is generally represented by these mytholOgical poets as being herself the parent of all things and who in The Indigitamenta, or Orphick Hymns, is said to be the same with Cypris, or Love itself. Moreover, in the body of this Argonautick poem, where the personated Orpheus introduceth himself singing to his lyre in reply to Chiron, he celebrateth "the obscure memory of Chaos, and the natures which it contained within itself in a state of perpetual vicissitude; how the heaven had its boundary determined, the generation of the earth, the depth of the ocean, and also the sapient Love, the most ancient, the self-sufficient, with all the beings which he produced when he separated one thing from another:" which noble passage is more directly to Aristotle's purpose in the first book of his Metaphysicks than any of those which he has there quoted to shew that the ancient poets and mythologists agreed with Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and the other more sober philosophers, in that natural anticipation and common notion of mankind concerning the necessity of mind and reason to account for the connexion, motion, and good order of the world. For though neither this poem nor the hymns which pass under the same name are, it should seem, the work of the real Orpheus, yet beyond all question they are very ancient. The hymns more particularly are allowed to be older than the invasion of Greece by Xerxes, and were probably a set of publick and solemn forms of devotion, as appears by a passage in one of them, which Demosthenes hath almost literally cited in his first oration against Aristogiton, as the saying of Orpheus, the founder of their most holy mysteries. On this account they are of higher authority than any other mythological work now extant, the Theogony of Hesiod himself not excepted. The poetry of them is often extremely noble, and the mysterious air which prevails in them, together with its delightful impression upon the mind, cannot be better expressed than in that remarkable description with which they inspired the German editor Eschenbach when he accidentally met with them at Leipsick: "Thesaurum me reperisse credidi," says he, "et prosecto thesaurum reperi. Incredibile dictu quo me sacro horrore afflaverint indigitamenta ista deorum: nam et tempus ad illorum lectionem eligere cogebar, quod vel solum horrorem incutere animo potest, nocturnum; cum enim totam diem consumserim in contemplando urbis splendore, et in adeundis, quibus scatet urbs illa, viris doctis; sola nox restabat, quam Orpheo consecrare potui. In abyssum quendam mysteriorum venerandae antiquitatis descendere videbar, quotiescunque silente mundo, solis vigilantibus astris et luna,  istos hymnos ad manus sumsi."℣. 25. Chaos.] The unformed undigested mass of Moses and Plato, which Milton calls
"The womb of Nature."Ibid. Love the sire of Fate.] Fate is the universal system of natural causes, the work of the Omnipotent Mind or of Love; so Minucius Felix: "Quid enim aliud eft fatum, quam quod de unoquoque nostrum deus fatus est." So also Cicero, in the first Book on Divination; "Fatum autem id appello, quod Graeci ΕΙΡΜΑΡΜΕΝΗΝ; id est, ordinem seriemque causarum, cum causa causae nexa rem ex se gignat—ex quo intelligitur, ut fatum sit non id quod superstitiose, sed id quod physice dicitur causa aeterna rerum." To the same purpose is the doctrine of Hierocles in that excellent fragment concerning Providence and Destiny. As to the three Fates or Destinies of the poets, they represented that part of the general system of natural causes which relate to man and to other mortal beings, for so we are told in the hymn addressed to them among the Orphick Indigitamenta, where they are called the daughters of Night (or Love) and contrary to the vulgar notion are distinguished by the epithets of Gentle and Tenderhearted. According to Hesiod, Theog. ver. 904, they were the daughters of Jupiter and Themis, but in the Orphick Hymn to Venus or Love that goddess is directly styled the mother of Necessity, and is represented immediately after as governing the three Destinies, and conducting the whole system of Natural causes.
Elder than Chaos. Born of Fate was Time,℣. 26. Born of Fate was Time.] Cronos, Saturn, or Time, was, according to Apollodorus, the son of Coelum and Tellus; but the author of the Hymns gives it quite undisguised by mythological language, and calls him plainly the offspring of the Earth and the starry Heaven, that is of Fate, as explained in the preceding note.Who many sons and many comely births
Devour'd, relentless Father! till the child℣. 28. Who many sons devour'd.] The known fable of Saturn devouring his children was certainly meant to imply the dissolution of natural bodies, which are produced and destroyed by Time.℣. 28. The child—Of Rhea.] Jupiter so called by Pindar.Of Rhea drove him from the upper sky,℣. 29. Drove him from the upper sky.] That Jupiter dethroned his father Saturn is recorded by all the mythologists. Phurnutus or Cornutus, the author of a little Greek treatise on the nature of the gods, informs us that by Jupiter was meant the vegetable soul of the world, which restrained and prevented those uncertain alterations which Saturn or Time used formerly to cause in the mundane system.
And quell'd his deadly might. Then social reign'd℣. 30. Then social reign'd, &c.] Our mythology here supposeth that before the establishment of the vital, vegetative, plastick nature, (represented by Jupiter) the four elements were in a variable and unsettled condition, but afterwards welldisposed, and at peace among themselves. Tethys was the wife of the Ocean, Ops or Rhea the earth, Vesta the eldest daughter of Saturn fire, and the Cloudcompeller, or , the air, though he also represented the plastick principle of nature, as may be seen in the Orphick hymn inscribed to him.The kindred pow'rs Tethys and rev'rend Ops,
And spotless Vesta, while supreme of swayRemain'd the Cloudcompeller. From the couchOf Tethys sprang the sedgy-crowned race℣. 34. The sedgy-crowned race.] The river-gods, who according to Hesiod's Theogony were the sons of Oceanus and Tethys.Who from a thousand urns o'er ev'ry climeSend tribute to their parent; and from them℣. 36. From them—Are ye O Naiads!] The descent of the Naiads is less certain than most points of the Greek mythology, Homer, Odyss. xiii.. Virgil in the eighth book of the Aeneid speaks as if the Nymphs or Naiads were the parents of the rivers, but in this he contradicts the testimony of Hesiod, and evidently departs from the orthodox system which representeth several nymphs as retaining to every single river. On the other hand Callimachus, who was very learned in all the school-divinity of those times, in his Hymn to Delos maketh Peneus the great Thessalian river-godthe father of his nymphs; and Ovid, in the fourteenth book of his Metamorphoses, mentions the Naiads of Latium as the immediate daughters of the neighbouring river-gods. Accordingly the Naiads of particular rivers are occasionally both by Ovid and Statius called by a patronymick, from the name of the river to which they belong.Are ye O Naiads! Arethusa fair,

But Hyperion is put by Homer in the same manner as here, for the Sun himself.Unbends their languid pinions aid from youThey ask; Favonius and the mild SouthwestFrom you relief implore: your sallying streams℣. 49. Your sallying streams.] The state of the atmosphere with respect to rest and motion is in several ways affected by rivers and running streams, and that more especially in hot seasons; first, they destroy its equilibrium, by cooling those parts of it with which they are in contact; and, secondly, they communicate their own motion; and the air which is thus moved by them being left heated is of consequence more elastick than other parts of the atmosphere, and therefore fitter to preserve and to propagate that motion.

Still with youPomona seeks to dwell; and o'er the lawnsAnd o'er the vale of Richmond, where with ThamesYe love to wander, Amalthea pours℣. 83. Amalthea.] The mother of the first Bacchus, whose birth and education was written, as Diodorus Siculus informs us, in the old Pelasgick character by Thymoetes, grandson to Laomedon and contemporary with Orpheus. Thymoetes had travelled over Libya to the country which borders on the western ocean, there he saw the island of Nysa, and learned from the inhabitants that "Ammon king of Libya was married in former ages to Rhea sister of Saturn and the Titans; that he afterwards fell in love with a beautiful virgin whose name was Amalthea, had by her a son, and gave her possession of a neighbouring track of land wonderfully fertile, which in shape nearly resembling the horn of an ox was thence called the Hesperian horn, and afterwards the horn of Amalthea; that fearing the jealousy of Rhea he concealed the young Bacchus with his mother in the island of Nysa;" the beauty of which Diodorus describes with great dignity and pomp of style. This fable is one of the noblest in all the ancient mythology, and seems to have made a particular impression on the imagination of Milton, the only modern poet (unless perhaps it be necessary to except Spenser) who in these mysterious traditions of the poetick story had a heart to feel and words to express the simple and solitary genius of Antiquity. To raise the idea of his Paradise he prefers it even to
—"that Nysean isle"Girt by the river Triton, where old Cham"(Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove)"Hid Amalthea and her florid son"Young Bacchus from his stepdame Rhea's eye."

Hath he not won.] Mercury, the patron of commerce, being so greatly dependent on the good offices of the Naiads, in return obtains for them the friendship of Minerva, the goddess of War; for military power, at least the naval part of it, hath constantly followed the establishment of trade; which exemplifies the preceding observation, that "from bounty issueth power."Of Arms to court your friendship?

Tho' a mortal handExcite the strings to utt'rance, yet for themesNot unregarded of celestial pow'rsI frame their language, and the Muses deignTo guide the pious tenour of my lay.The Muses (sacred by their gifts divine)In early days did to my wond'ring senseTheir secrets oft' reveal; oft' my rais'd earIn slumber selt their musick; oft' at noonOr hour of sunset by some lonely stream,In field or shady grove, they taught me words
Of pow'r from death and envy to preserveThe good man's name; whence yet with gratefulmindAnd off'rings unprofan'd by ruder eyeMy vows I send, my homage, to the seatsOf rocky Cirrha where with you they dwell,℣. 252. Cirrha.] One of the summits of Parnassus, and sacred to Apollo. Near it were several fountains said to be frequented by the Muses. Nysa, the other eminence of the same mountain, was dedicated to Bacchus.Where you their chaste campanious they admitThro' all the hallow'd scene, where oft' intentAnd leaning o'er Castalia's mossy vergeThey mark the cadence of your confluent urnsHow tuneful, yielding gratefullest reposeTo their consorted measure, till againWith emulation all the sounding choir,And bright Apollo leader of the song,Their voices thro' the liquid air exalt,And sweep their lofty strings; those pow'rful stringsThat charm the mind of gods, that fill the courts℣. 263. —charm the mind of gods.] This whole passage concerning the effects of sacred musick among the gods is taken from Pindar's first Pythian ode.Of wide Olympus with oblivion sweetOf evils, with immortal rest from cares,Assuage the terrours of the throne of Jove,And quench the formidable thunderboltOf unrelenting fire. With slacken'd wingsWhile now the solemn concert breathes around
Incumbent o'er the sceptre of his lordSleeps the stern eagle, by the number'd notesPossess'd, and satiate with the melting tone,Sov'reign of birds! The furious god of WarHis darts forgetting and the winged wheelsThat bear him vengeful o'er th' embattled plain,Relents and sooths his own fierce heart to ease,Most welcome ease. The fire of gods and menIn that great moment of divine delightLooks down on all that live, and whatsoe'erHe loves not o'er the peopled earth and o'erTh' interminated ocean he beholdsCurs'd with abhorrence by his doom severe,And troubled at the sound. Ye Naiads! yeWith ravish'd ears the melody attendWorthy of sacred silence, but the slavesOf Bacchus with tempest'ous clamours striveTo drown the heav'nly strains, of highest JoveIrrev'rent, and by mad presumption fir'dTheir own discordant raptures to advanceWith hostile emulation. Down they rushFrom Nysa's vine-impurpled cliff the damesOf Thrace, the Satyrs, and th' unruly Fauns,With old Silenus reeling thro' the crowdWhich gambols round him, in convulsions wildTossing their limbs, and brandishing in airThe ivy-mantled thyrsus, or the torch
Thro' black smoke flaming, to the Phrygian pipe's℣. 297. Phrygian pipe's.] The Phrygian musick was fantastick and turbulent, and fit to excite disorderly passions.Shrill voice, and to the clashing cymbals, mix'dWith shrieks and frantick uproar. May the godsFrom ev'ry unpolluted ear avertTheir orgies! If within the seats of men,Within the walls, the gates, where Pallas holds℣. 302. The gates, where Pallas holds—The guardian key.] It was the office of Minerva to be the guardian of walled cities, whence she was named ΠΟΑΙΑΣ and ΠΟΔΙΟΥΧΟΣ, and had her statues placed in their gates, being supposed to keep the keys, and on that account styled ΚΑΗΔΟΥΧΟΣ.The guardian key, if haply there be foundWho loves to mingle with the revel bandAnd hearken to their accents, who aspiresFrom such instructers to inform his breastWith verse, let him, fit votarist! imploreTheir inspiration. He perchance the giftsOf young Lyaeus and the dread exploitsMay sing in aptest numbers; he the fate℣. 310. Fate—Of sober Pentheus.] Pentheus was torn in pieces by the Bacchanalian priests and women for despising their mysteries.Of sober Pentheus, he the Paphian rites,And naked Mars with Cytherea chain'd,And strong Alcides in the spinster's robes,May celebrate applauded; but with youO Naiads! far from that unhallow'd routMust dwell the man whoe'er to praised themes
Invokes th' immortal Muse. Th' immortal MuseTo your calm habitations, to the cave℣. 318. The cave—Corycian.] Of this cave Pausanias in his tenth book gives the following description: "Between Delphi and the eminences of Parnassus is a road to the grotto of Corycium, which has its name from the nymph Corycia, and is by far the most remarkable which I have seen. One may walk a great way into it without a torch. It is of a considerable height, and hath several springs within it; and yet a much greater quantity of water distils from the shell and roof so as to be continually dropping on the ground. The people round Parnassus hold it sacred to the Corycian nymphs and to Pan."Corycian or the Delphick mount, will guide℣. 319. Delphick mount.] Delphi, the seat and oracle of Apollo, had a mountainous and rocky situation on the skirts of Parnassus.His footsteps, and with your unsully'd streams
His lips will bathe, whether th' eternal loreOf Themis or the majesty of JoveTo mortals he reveal, or teach his lyreTh' unenvy'd guerdon of the patriot's toils,In those unfading islands of the blestWhere sacred bards abide. Hail! honour'd Nymphs!Thrice hail! for you the Cyrenaick shell℣. 327. Cyrenaick.] Cyrene was the native country of Callimachus, whose Hymns are the most remarkable example of that mythological passion which is assumed in the preceding poem, and have always afforded particular pleasure to the author of it by reason of the mysterious solemnity with which they affect the mind. On this account he was induced to attempt somewhat in the same manner, solely by way of exercise, the manner itself being now almost entirely abandoned in poetry: and as the mere genealogy or the personal adventures of Heathen gods could have been but little interesting to a modern reader, it was therefore thought proper to select some convenient part of the history of Nature, and to employ these ancient divinities as it is probable they were first employed, to wit, in personifying natural causes, and in representing the mutual agreement or opposition of the corporeal and moral powers of the world, which hath been accounted the very highest office of poetry.Behold I touch revering: to my songsBe present ye with favourable feet,And all profaner audience far remove.HYMN TO SCIENCE."O vitae philosophia dux! O virtutis indagatrix, expultrixque vitiorum.—Tu urbes peperisti: tu inventrix legum, tu magistra morum et disciplinae fuisti: ad te confugimus, a te opem petimus." CIC. Tusc. Quaest.I.SCIENCE! thou fair effusive ray,From the great source of mental dayFree, gen'rous, and refin'd,Descend with all thy treasures fraught,Illumine each bewilder'd thought,And bless my lab'ring mind!II.But first with thy resistless lightDisperse those phantoms from my sight,
Those mimick shades of thee,The scholiast's learning, sophist's cant,The visionary bigot's rant,The monk's philosophy.III.O let thy pow'rful charms impartThe patient head the candid heartDevoted to thy sway,Which no weak passions e'er mislead,Which still with dauntless steps proceedWhere Reason points the way!IV.Give me to learn each secret cause;Let Number's, Figure's, Motion's, lawsReveal'd before me stand;These to great Nature's scenes apply,And round the globe and thro' the skyDisclose her working hand.V.Next to thy nobler search resign'dThe busy, restless, human mindThro' ev'ry maze pursue;Detect perception where it lies,Catch the ideas as they rise,And all their changes view.VI.Say from what simple springs beganThe vast ambitious thoughts of man
Which range beyond control,Which seek eternity to trace,Dive thro' th' infinity of space,And strain to grasp the whole?VII.Her secret stores let Mem'ry tell,Bid Fancy quit her Fairy cellIn all her colours drest,While prompt her sallies to controlReason the judge recalls the soulTo truth's severest test.VIII.Then lanch thro' Being's wide extent;Let the fair scale with just ascentAnd cautious steps be trod,And from the dead corporeal massThro' each progressive order passTo Instinct, Reason, God.IX.There, Science! veil thy daring eye,Nor dive too deep nor soar too highIn that divine abyss,To Faith content thy beams to lend,Her hopes t' assure her steps befriend,And light her way to bless.X.Then downwards take thy flight again,Mix with the policies of men
And social Nature's ties;The plan the genius of each state,Its int'rest and its pow'rs, relate,Its fortunes and its rise.XI.Thro' private life pursue thy course,Trace ev'ry action to its source,And means and motives weigh;Put tempters, passions, in the scale,Mark what degrees in each prevail,And fix the doubtful sway.XII.That last best effort of thy skill,To form the life and rule the will,Propitious Pow'r! impart;Teach me to cool my passions' fires,Make me the judge of my desires,The master of my heart.XIII.Raise me above the vulgar's breath,Pursuit of fortune, fear of death,And all in life that is mean:Still true to reason be my plan,Still let my actions speak the manThro' ev'ry various scene.XIV.Hail! queen of Manners, light of truth;Hail! charm of age and guide of youth,
Sweet refuge of distress;In bus'ness thou exact, polite;Thou giv'st retirement its delight,Prosperity its grace.XV.Of wealth, pow'r, freedom, thou the cause;Foundress of order, cities, laws,Of arts inventress, thou!Without thee what were humankind?How vast their wants, their thoughts how blind,Their joys how mean, how few!XVI.Sun of the soul! thy beams unveil;Let others spread the daring sailOn Fortune's faithless sea,While undeluded happier IFrom the vain tumult timely flyAnd sit in peace with thee.INSCRIPTIONS.I. FOR A GROTTO.To me, whom in their lays the shepherds callActaea, daughter of the neighb'ring stream,This cave belongs. The figtree and the vineWhich o'er the rocky entrance downward shootWere plac'd by Glycon: he with cowslips pale,Primrose and purple lychnis, deck'd the greenBefore my threshold, and my shelving wallsWith honeysuckle cover'd. Here at noonLall'd by the murmur of my rising fountI slumber: here my clust'ring fruits I tend,Or from the humid flow'rs at break of dayFresh garlands weave, and chase from all my boundsEach thing impure or noxious. Enter inO Stranger! undismay'd; nor bat nor toadHere lurks; and if thy breast of blameless thoughtsApprove thee, not unwelcome shalt thou treadMy quiet mansion, chiefly if thy nameWise Pallas and th' immortal Muses own.II. FOR A STATUE OF CHAUCER AT WOODSTOCK.SUCH was old Chaucer, such the placid mienOf him who first with harmony inform'dThe language of our fathers. Here he dweltFor many a cheerful day. These ancient wallsHave often heard him while his legends blitheHe sang of love or knighthood, or the wilesOf homely life, thro' each estate and ageThe fashions and the follies of the worldWith cunning hand portraying. Tho' perchanceFrom Blenheim's tow'rs O Stranger! thou art comeGlowing with Churchill's trophies, yet in vainDost thou applaud them if thy breast be coldTo him this other hero, who in timesDark and untaught began with charming verseTo tame the rudeness of his native land.III.WHOE'ER thou art whose path in summer liesThro' yonder village, turn thee where the groveOf branching oaks a rural palace oldImbosoms; there dwells Albert, gen'rous lordOf all the harvest round! and onward thenceA low plain chapel fronts the morning light
Fast by a silent rivulet. Humbly walkO Stranger! o'er the consecrated ground,And on that verdant hillock which thou seestBeset with osiers let thy pious handSprinkle fresh water from the brook, and strewSweet-smelling flow'rs, for there doth Edmund rest,The learned shepherd, for each rural artFam'd, and for sons harmonious, and the woesOf ill-requited love. The faithless prideOf fair Matilda sank him to the graveIn manhood's prime; but soon did righteous Heav'nWith tears, with sharp remorse and pining care,Avenge her falsehood; nor could all the goldAnd nuptial pomp which lur'd her plighted faithFrom Edmund to a lostier husband's homeRelieve her breaking heart, or turn asideThe strokes of Death. Go, Traveller! relateThe mournful story; haply some fair maidMay hold it in remembrance, and be taughtThat riches cannot pay for truth or love.IV.O Youths and Virgins! O declining Eld!O pale Misfortune's slaves! O ye who dwellUnknown with humble Quiet! ye who waitIn courts, or fill the golden seat of kings,O sons of Sport and Pleasure! O thou WretchThat weepst for jealous love, or the sore wounds
Of conscious guilt or Death's rapacious hand,Which left thee void of hope! O ye who roamIn exile! ye who thro' th' embattled fieldSeek bright renown, or who for nobler palmsContend, the leaders of a publick cause!Approach; behold this Marble! know ye notThe features? hath not oft' his faithful tongueTold you the fashion of your own estate,The secrets of your bosom? Here then roundHis monument with rev'rence while ye standSay to each other "This was Shakespeare's form,"Who walk'd in ev'ry path of human life,"Felt ev'ry passion, and to all mankind"Doth now, will ever, that experience yield"Which his own genius only could acquire."V.GVLIELMVS III.

AVCTORI PVBLICAE FELICITATIS P G. A. M. A.VI. FOR A COLUMN AT RUNNYMEDE.THOU who the verdant plain dost traverse hereWhile Thames among his willows from thy viewRetires, O Stranger! stay thee, and the sceneAround contemplate well. This is the placeWhere England's ancient Barons, clad in arms,And stern with conquest, from their tyrant king(Then render'd tame) did challenge and secureThe Charter of thy freedom. Pass not onTill thou hast bless'd their memory, and paidThose thanks which God appointed the rewardOf publick virtue. And if chance thy homeSalute thee with a father's honour'd nameGo call thy sons, instruct them what a debtThey owe their ancestors, and make them swearTo pay it, by transmitting down entireThose sacred rights to which themselves were born.VII. THE WOODNYMPH.APPROACH in silence; it is no vulgar taleWhich I the Dryad of this hoary oakPronounce to mortal ears. The second ageNow hasteneth to its period since I roseOn this fair lawn. The groves of yonder valeAre all my offspring; and each Nymph who guardsThe copses and the surrow'd fields beyond
Obeys me. Many changes have I seenIn human things, and many awful deedsOf justice, when the ruling hand of JoveAgainst the tyrants of the land, againstThe unhallow'd sons of Luxury and Guile,Was arm'd for retribution. Thus at lengthExpert in laws divine I know the pathsOf Wisdom, and erroneous Tolly's endHave oft' presag'd; and now wellpleas'd I waitEach ev'ning till a noble youth who lovesMy shade a while releas'd from publick caresYon' peaceful gate shall enter, and sit downBeneath my branches: then his musing mindI pompt unseen, and place before his viewSincerest forms of good, and move his heartWith the dread bounties of the Sire SupremeOf gods and men, with Freedom's gen'rous deeds,The losty voice of Glory, and the faithOf sacred Friendship. Stranger! I have toldMy function: if within thy bosom dwellAught which may challenge praise, thou wilt not leaveUnhonour'd my abode, nor shall I hearA sparing benediction from thy tongue.VIII.YE Pow'rs unseen! to whom the bards of GreeceErected altars, ye who to the mindMore lofty views unfold, and prompt the heartWith more divine emotions, if erewhile
Not quite unpleasing have my votive ritesOf you been deem'd when oft' this lonely seatTo you I consecrated, then vonchsafeHere with your instant energy to crownMy happy solitude. It is the hourWhen most I love t' invoke you, and have feltMost frequent your glad ministry divine.The air is calm, the sun's unveiled orbShines in the middle heav'n; the harvest roundStands quiet, and among the golden sheavesThe reapers lie reclin'd; the neighb'ring grovesAre mute, nor ev'n a linnet's random strainEchoeth amid the silence. Let me feelYour influence ye kind Pow'rs! Aloft in heav'nAbide ye? or on those transparent cloudsPass ye from hill to hill? or on the shadesWhich yonder elms cast o'er the lake belowDo you converse retir'd? From what lov'd hauntShall I expect you? Let me once more feelYour influence O ye kind inspiring Pow'rs!And I will guard it well; nor shall a thoughtRise in my mind, nor shall a passion moveAcross my bosom, unobserv'd, unstor'd,By faithful Memory: and then at someMore active moment will I call them forthAnew, and join them in majestick forms,And give them utt'rance in harmonious strains,That all mankind shall wonder at your sway.IX.ME tho' in life's sequester'd valeTh' Almighty Sire ordain'd to dwell,Remote from Glory's toilsome waysAnd the great scenes of publick praise,Yet let me still with grateful prideRemember how my infant frameHe temper'd with prophetick flame,And early musick to my tongue supply'd.'Twas then my future fate he weigh'd,And this be thy concern he said,At once with Passion's keen alarms,And Beauty's pleasurable charms,And sacred Truth's eternal light,To move the various mind of man,Till under one unblemish'd planHis reason, fancy, and his heart, unite.CONTENTS.ODES.Book I.
