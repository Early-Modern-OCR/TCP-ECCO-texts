LONDON: OR, THE PROGRESS OF COMMERCE. A POEM. By Mr. GLOVER. THE SECOND EDITION.LONDON; Printed for T. COOPER, at the Globe, in Paternoster-Row. MDCCXXXIX. (Price One Shilling.)The ARGUMENT.The following poem represents Commerce as the child of Neptune, and born on the coast of Libya in an island, celebrated in fabulous antiquity for its fruitfulness and plenty during the first uncultivated ages, whence the new divinity is supposed to convey these blessings round the world. Her birth is attended by many of the Gods, who endow her with their several gifts: among the rest Apollo appoints her to be the inventress of letters; Sir Isaac Newton's opinion being here alluded to, that merchandize gave rise to this wonderful discovery. Commerce is then described as making her first appearance to the world among the Phoenicians, the earliest people, who exercis'd an extensive trade. From thence she proceeds to visit other parts of the globe, and endeavours to erect her principal empire at Carthage, situated in Libya, the country assign'd for her nativity. Upon the destruction of that city she again removes from place to place; but at length, allured by the vigour and singular resolution of the Dutch in throwing off the Spanish yoke, she takes up her residence with that indefatigable people. Lastly, by the good laws, which have been made from time to time for the encouragement of trade among us, especially by the act of navigation, which has transferred a great part of the Dutch traffick to ourselves, she is suppos'd on our invitation to choose England for her chief abode, more particularly London, our principal emporium, as well as capital

city. And upon this occasion an enquiry is made, how it has come to pass, that, notwithstanding the great wealth and power attending Commerce, the course of trade should so often have shifted its seat; and the means, conceived most effectual to fix this wanderer here, are pointed out.LONDON: OR, The Progress of Commerce.YE northern blasts, and The east wind. Eurus, wont to sweepWith rudest pinions o'er the furrow'd waves,Awhile suspend your violence, and waftFrom sandy Bremen is situated on the Weser, and Hamburgh on the Elb. Weser and the broad-mouth'd ElbMy freighted vessels to the destin'd shore,Safe o'er th' unruffled main; let ev'ry thought,Which may disquiet, and alarm my breast,Be absent now; that, dispossess'd of care,And free from every tumult of the mind,With each disturbing passion hush'd to peace,I may pour all my spirit on the theme,Which opens now before me, and demandsThe loftiest strain. The eagle, when he tow'rsBeyond the clouds, the fleecy robes of heav'n,Disdains all objects but the golden sun,Full on th' effulgent orb directs his eye,And sails exulting through the blaze of day;So, while her wing attempts the boldest flight,Rejecting each inferior theme of praise,Thee, ornament of Europe, Albion's pride,Fair seat of wealth and freedom, thee my MuseShall celebrate, O LONDON: thee she hails,Thou lov'd abode of Commerce, last retreat,Whence she contemplates with a tranquil mindHer various wandrings from the fated hour,That she abandon'd her maternal clime;Neptunian Commerce, whom Phoenicé bore,Illustrious nymph, that nam'd the fertile plains,Along the sounding main extended far,Which flow'ry Carmel with its sweets perfumes,And with its cedars Libanus o'ershades:Her from the bottom of the watry world,As once she stood, in radiant beauties grac'd,To mark the heaving tide, the piercing eyeOf Neptune view'd enamour'd: from the deepThe God ascending rushes to the beach,And clasps th' affrighted virgin. From that daySoon as the paly regent of the nightNine times her monthly progress had renew'dThrough heav'n's illumin'd vault, Phoenicé, ledBy shame, once more the sea-worn margin sought,There pac'd with painful steps the barren sands,A solitary mourner, and, the surge,Which gently roll'd beside her, now no moreWith placid eyes beholding, thus exclaim'd.YE fragrant shrubs, and cedars' lofty shade,Which crown my native hills, ye spreading palms,That rise majestic on these fruitful meads,With you, who gave the lost Phoenicé birth,And you, who bear th' endearing name of friends,Once faithful partners of my chaster hours,Farewel! To thee, perfidious God, I come,Bent down with pain and anguish on thy sands,I come thy suppliant; death is all, I crave;Bid thy devouring waves inwrap my head;And to the bottom whelm my cares and shame!SHE ceas'd, when sudden from th' unclosing deepA crystal car emerg'd, with glitt'ring shells,Call'd from their oozy beds by Tethys' train,And blushing coral deck'd, whose ruddy glowMix'd with the watry lustre of the pearl.A smiling band of sea-born nymphs attend,Who from the shore with gentle hands conveyThe fear-subdu'd Phoenicé, and alongThe lucid chariot place. As there with dreadAll mute, and struggling with her painful throesShe lay, the winds by Neptune's high commandWere silent round her; not a Zephyr dar'dTo wanton o'er the cedar's branching top,Nor on the plain the stately palm was seenTo wave its graceful verdure; o'er the mainNo undulation broke the smooth expanse,But all was hush'd and motionless around,All but the lightly-sliding car, impell'dAlong the level azure by the strengthOf active Tritons, rivalling in speedThe rapid meteor, whose sulphureous trainGlides o'er the brow of darkness, and appearsThe livid ruins of a falling star.BENEATH the Lybian skies a blissful isle,By Triton, a river and lake of ancient Lybia. Triton's floods encircled, Nysa lay.Here youthful Nature wanton'd in delights,And here the guardians of the bounteous horn,While it was now the infancy of time,Nor yet th' uncultivated globe had learn'dTo smile, Fruitfulness. Eucarpé, Plenty. Dapsiléa dwelt,With all the nymphs, whose secret care had nurs'dThe eldest Bacchus. From the flow'ry shoreA turf-clad valley opens, and alongIts verdure mild the willing feet allures;While on its sloping sides ascends the prideOf hoary groves, high-arching o'er the valeWith day-rejecting gloom. The solemn shadeHalf round a spacious lawn at length expands,This whole description of the rock and grotto is taken from Diod. Siculus, lib. 3. pag. 202.Clos'd by a tow'ring cliff, whose forehead glowsWith azure, purple, and ten thousand dyes,From its resplendent fragments beaming round;Nor less irradiate colours from beneathOn ev'ry side an ample grot reflects,As down the perforated rock the sunPours his meridian blaze; rever'd abodeOf Nysa's nymphs, with ev'ry plant attir'd,That wears undying green, refresh'd with rillsFrom ever-living fountains, and enrich'dWith all Pomona's bloom: unfading flow'rsGlow on the mead, and spicy shrubs perfumeWith inexhausted sweets the cooling gale,Which breathes incessant there; while ev'ry birdOf tuneful note his gay or plaintive songBlends with the warble of meandring streams,Which o'er their pebbled channels murm'ring laveThe fruit-invested hills, that rise around.The gentle Nereids to this calm recessPhoenicé bear; nor Dapsiléa bland,Nor good Eucarpé, studious to obeyGreat Neptune's will, their hospitable careRefuse; nor long Lucina is invok'd.Soon as the wondrous infant sprung to day,Earth rock'd around; with all their nodding woods,And streams reverting to their troubled source,The mountains shook; while Lybia's neighb'ring God,Mysterious Ammon from his hollow cellWith deep-resounding accent thus to heav'n,To earth, and sea the mighty birth proclaim'd.A NEW-BORN pow'r behold! whom fate hath call'dThe Gods' imperfect labour to complete,This wide creation. She in lonely sandsShall bid the tow'r-encircled city rise,The barren sea shall people, and the wildsOf dreary nature shall with plenty cloath;She shall enlighten man's unletter'd race,And with endearing intercourse uniteRemotest nations, scorch'd by sultry suns,Or freezing near the snow-encrusted pole:Where'er the joyous vine disdains to grow,The fruitful olive, or the golden ear;Her hand divine with interposing aidTo ev'ry climate shall the gifts supplyOf Ceres, Bacchus, and Minerva, the tutelary Goddess of the Athenians, to whom she gave the olive. th'Athenian maid:The graces, joys, emoluments of lifeFrom her exhaustless bounty all shall flow.THE heav'nly prophet ceas'd.

Or, that pernicious hour,Was Heav'n disgusted with its wondrous works,That to thy fell exterminating handTh' immense Peruvian empire it resign'd,And all, which lordly Montezeuma emperor of Mexico.

Gracious pow'r!Continue still to hear my vows, and blessMy honourable industry, which courtsNo other smile but thine; for thou aloneCan'st wealth bestow with independence crown'd:Nor yet exclude contemplative repose,But to my dwelling grant the solemn calmOf learned leisure, never to rejectThe visitation of the tuneful maids,Who seldom deign to leave their sacred haunts,And grace a mortal mansion; thou divideWith them my labours; pleasure I resign,And, all devoted to my midnight lamp,Ev'n now, when Albion o'er the foamy breastOf groaning Tethys spreads its threat'ning fleets,I grasp the sounding shell, prepar'd to singThat hero's valour, who shall best confoundHis injur'd country's foes: ev'n now I feelCelestial fires descending on my breast,Which prompt thy daring suppliant to explore,Why, though deriv'd from Neptune, though rever'dAmong the nations, by the Gods endow'd,Thou never yet from eldest times hast foundOne permanent abode, why, oft expell'dThy favour'd seats, from clime to clime hast borneThy wand'ring steps, why LONDON late hath seen(Thy lov'd, thy last retreat) desponding careO'ercloud thy brow: O listen, while the Muse,Th' immortal progeny of Jove, unfoldsThe fatal cause.

Trebia overflow'd its banksIn vain, and deep-dy'd Trasimenus roll'dIts crimson waters; Cannae's signal dayThe fame alone of great Amilcar's sonEnlarg'd, while still undisciplin'd, dismay'd,Her head commercial Carthage bow'd at lastTo military Rome: th' unalter'd willOf heav'n in ev'ry climate hath ordain'd,And ev'ry age, that empire shall attendThe sword, and steel shall ever conquer gold.Then from thy suff'rings learn; th' auspicious hourNow smiles; our wary magistrates have arm'dOur hands; thou, Goddess, animate our breastsTo cast inglorious indolence aside,That once again, in bright battalions rang'd,Our thousands and ten thousands may be seenTheir country's only rampart, and the dreadOf wild ambition.

Helsingburg and Steinboch soon would shareThe admiration of the northern world:Helvetia's hills behold, th' aërial seatOf long-supported Liberty, who thence,Securely resting on her faithful shield,The warrior's corselet flaming on her breast,Looks down with scorn on spacious realms, which groanIn servitude around her, and, her swordWith dauntless skill high-brandishing, defiesThe Austrian eagle, and imperious Gaul:And O could those ill-fated shades arise,Whose valiant ranks along th' ensanguin'd dustOf The London train'd bands, and auxiliary regiments (of whose inexperience of danger, or any kind of service, beyond the easy practice of their postures in the artillery garden, men had till then too cheap an estimation) behav'd themselves to wonder; and were, in truth, the preservation of that army that day. For they stood as a bulwark and rampire to defend the rest; and when their wings of horse were scatter'd and dispers'd, kept their ground so steadily, that though prince Rupert himself led up the choice horse to charge them, and endur'd their storm of small shot, he could make no impression on their stand of pikes; but was forc'd to wheel about.
