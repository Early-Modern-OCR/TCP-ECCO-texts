To Her ROYAL HIGHNESS the PRINCESS of WALES, With the Tragedy of CATO. Nov. 1714.TO Sir GODFREY KNELLER, ON HIS PICTURE of the KING.LONDON: Printed for J. Tonson, at Shakespear's-Head overagainst Catherine-street in the Strand. 1716.To Her ROYAL HIGHNESS the PRINCESS of WALES, With the Tragedy of CATO. Nov. 1714.THE Muse that oft, with sacred Raptures fired,Has gen'rous Thoughts of Liberty inspired,And, boldly rising for Britannia's Laws,Engaged great Cato in her Country's Cause,On You submissive waits, with Hopes assured,By whom the mighty Blessing stands secured,And all the Glories, that our Age adorn,Are promis'd to a People yet unborn.No longer shall the widow'd Land bemoanA broken Lineage, and a doubtful Throne;But boast her Royal Progeny's Increase,And count the Pledges of her future Peace.
O Born to strengthen and to grace our Isle!While You, fair PRINCESS, in your Off-spring smileSupplying Charms to the succeeding Age,Each Heav'nly Daughter's Triumphs we presage;Already see th' Illustrious Youths complain,And pity Monarchs doom'd to sigh in vain.Thou too, the Darling of our fond Desires,Whom Albion, opening wide her Arms, requires,With manly Valour and attractive AirShalt quell the Fierce, and captivate the Fair,O England's younger Hope! in whom conspireThe Mother's Sweetness, and the Father's Fire!For Thee perhaps, ev'n Now, of Kingly RaceSome dawning Beauty bloom's in ev'ry Grace,Some CAROLINA, to Heav'n's Dictates true,Who, while the Scepter'd Rivals vainly sue,Thy inborn Worth with conscious Eyes shall see,And slight th' Imperial Diadem for Thee.Pleas'd with the Prospect of successive Reigns,The tuneful Tribe no more in daring Strains
Shall vindicate, with pious Fears opprest,Endanger'd Rights, and Liberty Distrest:To milder Sounds each Muse shall tune the Lyre,And Gratitude, and Faith to Kings inspire,And Filial Love; bid impious Discord cease,And sooth the madding Factions into Peace;Or rise Ambitious in more lofty Lays,And teach the Nation their new Monarch's Praise,Describe his awful Look, and Godlike Mind,And Caesar's Pow'r with Cato's Vertue join'd.Mean-while, Bright PRINCESS, who, with graceful EaseAnd native Majesty, are form'd to please,Behold those Arts with a propitious Eye,That suppliant to their great Protectress fly!Then shall they Triumph, and the British StageImprove her Manners, and refine her Rage,More noble Characters expose to view,And draw her finisht Heroines from You.Nor You the kind Indulgence will refuse,Skill'd in the Labours of the deathless Muse:
The deathless Muse with undiminisht RaysThrough distant Times the lovely Dame conveys.To GLORIANA Waller's Harp was strung;The Queen still shines, because the Poet sung.Ev'n all those Graces, in your Frame combin'd,The common Fate of Mortal Charms may find;(Content Our short-liv'd Praises to engage,The Joy and Wonder of a Single Age,)Unless some Poet in a lasting SongTo late Posterity their Fame prolong,Instruct our Sons the radiant Form to prize,And see Your Beauty with their Fathers' Eyes.TO Sir GODFREY KNELLER, ON HIS PICTURE of the KING.KNELLER, with silence and surprizeWe see Britannia's Monarch rise,A Godlike Form, by Thee display'dIn all the force of Light and Shade;And, Aw'd by thy delusive Hand,As in the Presence-chamber stand.The Magick of thy Art calls forthHis Secret Soul and Hidden Worth,His Probity and Mildness shows,His Care of Friends, and Scorn of Foes:
In ev'ry Stroke, in ev'ry Line,Does some exalted Vertue shine,And Albion's Happiness we traceThrough all the Features of his Face.O may I live to hail the Day,When the glad Nation shall surveyTheir Sov'reign, through his wide Command,Passing in Progress o'er the Land!Each Heart shall bend, and ev'ry VoiceIn loud applauding Shouts rejoice,Whilst All his Gracious Aspect praise,And Crowds grow Loyal as they Gaze.This Image on the Medal place'd,With its Bright Round of Titles grace'd,And Stamp'd on British Coins shall Live;To Richest Ores the Value give,Or, wrought within the Curious Mould,Shape and adorn the Running Gold.To bear this Form, the Genial SunHas daily, since his Course begun,Rejoice'd the Metal to Refine,And Ripen'd the Peruvian Mine.Thou, Kneller, long with noble Pride(The Foremost of thy Art) ha'st viedWith Nature in a gen'rous Strife,And touch'd the Canvas into Life.Thy Pencil has, by Monarchs sought,From Reign to Reign in Ermine wrought,And, in their Robes of State array'd,The Kings of half an Age display'd.Here swarthy Charles appears, and thereHis Brother with Dejected Air;Triumphant Nassau here we find,And with him bright Maria join'd;There Anna, Great as when she sentHer Armies through the Continent,E'er yet her Hero was disgrac't:O may fam'd BRUNSWICK be the Last,(Though Heav'n shou'd with my Wish agree,And long preserve thy Art in Thee)The Last, the Happiest British King,Whom Thou shalt paint, or I shall sing!Wise Phidias, thus his Skill to prove,Through many a God advanc'd to Jove,
And taught the polish'd Rocks to shineWith Airs and Lineaments divine;Till Greece, amaz'd, and half-afraid,Th' Assembled Deities survey'd.Great Pan, who wont to chase the Fair,And lov'd the spreading Oak, was there;Old Saturn too with up-cast EyesBeheld his Abdicated Skies;And mighty Mars, for War renown'd,In Adamantine Armour frown'd;By Him the childless Goddess rose,Minerva, studious to composeHer twisted Threads; the Webb she strung,And o'er a Loom of Marble hung:Thetis the troubled Ocean's Queen,Match'd with a Mortal, next was seen(Reclining on a Fun'ral Urn)Her short-liv'd Darling Son to Mourn.The Last was He, whose Thunder slewThe Titan-race, a Rebel Crew,That from a Hundred Hills, allie'dIn impious Leagues, their King defie'd.This Wonder of the Sculptor's HandProduc'd, his Art was at a stand:For who wou'd hope New Fame to raise,Or risque his well-establish'd Praise,That, his high Genius to approve,Had drawn a GEORGE, or carv'd a Jove!FINIS.
