The design of this Abstract is to teach a person acquainted with English how to speak and write correctly, without entering into all the minutiae of Grammar, which serve only to perplex and confound. The Author aims not at teaching his pupil what words are
particles, what prepositions, and so on; but merely to avoid false concords and incorrect language; and he flatters himself the few following pages will answer all the purposes better than more complete or regular systems. He has also added some few rules for read∣ing, which, if attended to, must lead to reading well.ABSTRACT OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR.Of the denomination of Words.THE only words necessary to be known gram∣matically, are Nouns, Pronouns, Adjectives, Verbs, Adverbs, and Participles.A Noun is the name of a thing, as Horse, Boat, Knife, &c.A Pronoun is a substitute for a Noun, as I, he, she, &c.An Adjective expresses the quality of a Noun, as a sound Horse; an open Boat; a sharp Knife; here sound, open, and sharp, are Verbs.A Verb implies the action of the Noun, and an Adverb the action of the Verb, as the horse gallops, the boat sails, the knife cuts: Here galloping is the action of the horse; sailing the action of the boat; and cutting the action of the knife; of course, gallops, sails, and cuts are Verbs.An Adverb expresses the action of the Verb. Thus the horse gallops quick; the boat sails briskly; the knife cuts badly. Here quick expresses the action of galloping; briskly that of sailing, and badly that of cutting; of course quick, briskly, and badly are Adverbs, that is, addition to Verbs.A Participle partakes of the qualities of both Noun and Verb, and implies, acting or being acted on.These are the different parts of speech, I would wish my pupil to be acquainted with. I will treat of them in their order.Of NOUNS.Nouns Substantives are the general names o things, except proper names, which are particular ones. A horse, for example, is a general name, it may be my horse or yours, so is a boat, a knife, &c. but proper names are particular ones, as Thomas, the name of a man: Jolly, the name of a horse, &c. Horse, boat, knife, &c. then are Nouns.Nouns have two numbers, the singular and the plural.The singular number expresses an individual, as a horse, a boat, a knife; the plural expresses many, as horses, boats, knives, &c.In other languages Nouns have a variety of cases, that is, vary in their terminations, but in English there are but two: these correspond with the geni∣tive and accusative. Thus, instead of the head of a horse, we say, a horse's head, (not horses, which is the plural number of horse, but horse's, which we call the genitive case singular); so boat's, knife's, as the boat's side, the knife's edge.Plurals ending in s have no genitive cases, we write womens, not women's; mens, not men's; and so on.No Nouns have accusative cases, but Pronouns; these vary their terminations when they follow or are acted upon by verbs.I preceding a verb, is changed to me when fol∣lowing one.We to us.Thou to thee or you.Ye to you.He to him.She to her.They to them.Who to whom.Thus we say, "I love you." I here precedes the verb love; but I could not follow the same verb with propriety, it would be rendered me. We should not say "You love I," but "you love me." So again, "Thou lovest me;" "I love thee." Thou before the verb, thee after it. "We love God;" "God loves us;" and so on.The words who and whom require a little further explanation. We say, "Kings are personages whom we revere." Here, though, in the present mode of speech, whom precedes the verb revere, it is nevertheless used in the accusative case, being the word which the verb revere governs and acts upon, answering to them, when we say "we revere them." So in the following example: "William was the person who came to me." Here the pro∣noun who precedes the verb came, and governs it. "William was the person to whom I spoke." Here whom, though it precedes, or is placed, before the verb spoke, (to render it more agreeable to the ear) is governed or acted on by it.English Nouns are then thus declined, none hav∣ing accusative cases but the Pronouns.Sing.HorseGen.Horse'sPlur.Horses.Sing.BoatGen.Boat'sPlur.Boats.Note, The genitive case implies of or belonging toThe word whose is sometimes used as the geni∣tive of which, and chiefly in poetry."—The fruit"Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste"Brought death into the world."MILTONBut of which is now most common. "The mat¦ters of which I spoke." Though whose may be used with propriety, when it refers to persons; as "This is the young woman whose worth I know."The genitive of the other Pronouns are as fol∣low:IGen. mine or myThouGen. thine or thyHeGen. hisSheGen. hersweGen. ours or ouryeGen. yours or yourtheyGen. theirs or theirItGen. itsMine, thine, ours, yours or theirs, may be used without a noun annexed, but my, thy, our, your, their, never. Thus, "Whose book is this?" The answer may be mine, or thine, or ours, or yours, or theirs, alone; but if we use my, thy, our, your, or their, we must add the noun book to it, a say, my book, thy book, our book, your book, or their book.When the word own is added to the pronouns my, thy, his, hers, our, your, or their, it is to render the expression more emphatical; as, "I live in my own house;" "I did it with my own hand." &c.The plural number is formed, by adding s at the end of the singular number, as in the following:Sing.Plur.Sing.Plur.HouseHousesTableTablesWalkWalksSisterSistersStoolStoolsOutrageOutrages, &c.LanceLancesBut there are some exceptions to this general rule, as the following irregular plurals will shew.Sing.Plur.Sing.Plur.LoafLoavesFootFeetCalfCalvesChurchChurchesShelfShelvesFishFishesHalfHalvesBoxBoxesSelfSelvesOxOxenSheafSheavesManMenThiefThievesSowSwineWifeWivesChildChildrenWolfWolvesBrotherBrethrenKnifeKnivesWomanWomenLouseLicePennyPenceMouseMiceBodyBodiesDieDiceMercyMerciesGooseGeeseEnemyEnemiesToothTeethWitnessWitnesses, &c.andThisTheseThatThoseThe singular and plural of some few words are the same, as sheep, deer, fern, hose, in which case the singular number is pointed out by a going be∣fore them, as a sheep, a deer.Some words also have no singular number, as annals, arms, ashes, bellows, breeches, cresses, en∣trails, ides, lungs, means, nones, scissars, sheers, snuf∣fers, thanks, tongs, wages, dregs, news, &c.Proper names of men, cities, rivers, countries, &c. have no plurals. This rule, however, is not without some exceptions. We say, "There were ten Williams in company." And when speaking of families, we say, the Marlboroughs, the Cavendishes, the Howards, &c.I can, at no better time, mention the proper use of the pronouns who, which, and what, as interro∣gatives or not.Who is used only when speaking of persons, as, "Who is that man, or that woman?" Which, when we speak of things, as, "Which is your cane? What, when we are speaking of the kind, quality, or order of persons or things, as, "What lady is that?" "What house is this?" "What (or which) place do you chuse?"When who and which are not interrogatives, that is, do not ask a question, they are used with the same distinction, that is, who for persons, and which for things. We say, "William was the person who came to me." "This is the horse which I bought."Now we are upon the subject of nouns, it is pro∣per to say something of gender.There are three genders the male, female, and neuter.The male and female distinguish the two sexes; whereas the neuter is applied to things without life, as not properly belonging to either of the other, as table, stne, rock, &c.When we speak of the male gender, we use the pronoun he; when of the female gender, she; when of the neuter, it. Thus,
The bridegroom, he came from the barn;The bride, she came in from the field;The table, it fell on the floor.We indeed deem most things that contain any thing within them to be of the female gender, as the earth, a ship, a house, &c. and in poetry, where writers will frequently give slight to their fancy, and personify inanimate substances, they are deemed o the male or female gender, according to the idea of the Poet. Thus Death, Time, the Sun, &c. are generally of the male gender; Faith, Hope, Cha∣rity, &c. of the female, as being of the softer virtues.But our language, in many instances, save us the necessity of adding pronouns to express genders, for we often distinguish the different sexes by di∣stinct words; as for example,Male.Female.Male.Female.FatherMotherSlovenSlutHusbandWifeManWomanBrotherSisterRakeJiltUncleAuntBoarSowWidowerWidowBuckDoeMasterMistressCockHenNephewNieceDogBitchWizzardWitchDrakeDuckBachelorMaid or Vir∣ginGanderGoose HorseMareBridegroomBrideRamEweWhoremongerWhore or Strumpet.SteerHeifer BoyGirlBullCowKingQueenLadLassLordLadyDukeDuchessMilterSpawner&c.There are also some few words, which distin∣guish the female sex from the male, by the ending;
MaleFemale.Male.Female.AbbotAbbessShepherdShepherdessActorActressExecutorExecutrixBaronBaronessAdminis∣tratorAministra∣trixHeirHeiressPriorPrioress&c.LionLionessWhere there are no words to distinguish the sexes, we frequently add one to answer the pur∣pose. Thus we say, a male-child, a female-child, a he-goat, a she-goat, a man servant, a maid-servant, a cock-sparrow, a hen-sparrow, or the like.Of ADJECTIVES.Adjectives are words which cannot stand alone, but are added to nouns to express their quality, as black, white, wise, foolish, round, square, &c. Thus we say, a black dog, a wise man, a round table.There are three degrees of Adjectives, called degrees of Comparison, the positive, comparative, and superlative.1. The positive degree is the quality itself, simply, as black, white, wise, &c.2. The comparative expresses more of any one thing than another, and is formed by adding er to te positive, as blacker, whiter, wiser: sometimes, in∣stead of saying blacker, we say more black; for white, more white; for wiser, more wise, &c.3. The superlative degree implies the highest, and is formed y the termination es, or the most before the positive. Thus blackest,  black; whitest, or most white; wisest or moSome superlatives are formed, by adding most as a termination; thus nether outer, outermost; under, undermost; upper, upper∣most; in, inner, innermost, &c.Many Adjectives do not admit of comparison by terminations, but are only compared by more and most, as benevolent, more benevolent, most benevolent. Some authors have used shadiest, virtuousest, famousest, mortalest, naturallest, powerfullest, inventivest, trifling∣est, &c. but these are liberties which every one cannot take, and are inelegant after all.Some again are irregularly compared, as,Positive.Compar.Superl.GoodBetterBestBadWorseWorstLittleLessLeastNearNearerNearestMuchMoreMostLateLaterLastIndeed, the comparison of Adjectives is very un∣certain, and being much regulated by the ear or agreeableness of sounds, cannot well be reduced to rules.When a noun is substituted for an adjective, and added to another noun by hyphen (-), such two words are called compound words, as Turkey-Leather, Mountain-wine, man-servant, sea-fish, &c.Of VERBS.Verbs, as I observed, express the action of Nouns.A Verb is said to have several moods and tenses. We shall have occasion only to name the Infinitive mood, which is known by the word to preceding it, as to love, to hate, &c. and two of the Tenses, the present, and the past: these two are expressed
by terminations, the other tenses are expressed  the auxiliary verbs shall, will, and have, precedin them, of course it is not necessary to mention ther as we have nothing to do but with the right use words themselves.The present time or tense is expressed by the ve itself, as burn, love, hate; the past time by the ter∣mination ed, as burned, loved, hated.A Verb has also three persons, 1st, 2d, and 3 and, like Nouns, two numbers, singular and plur.The three persons in the singular of verbs are thou, and he or she; in the plural, We, ye, athey. Thus,
Persons.Present tense, singular.1.I love2.Thou lovest3.He or she loveth or lovePlural.1.We love2.Ye love3.They love.Past time, singular.1.I loved2.Thou lovedst3.He or she loved.Plural.1.We loved2.Ye loved3.They loved.Infinitive mood.To love.Participle present.Loving.— past.Loved.There are two sorts of verbs, active and passive.  love is a verb active; to be loved, a verb passive; still, according to my first definition of a verb,  love, or be loved, implies the action of the person ving.The passive verb is formed by the addition of the xiliary or assisting verb, to be. Thus, in the pre∣nt tense or time,
Sing.I am, thou art, he or she is.Plur.We are or be, ye are or be, they are or be.Past tense or time.Sing.I was, thou wast or was, he or she was.Plur.We were, ye were, they were.Participle present.Being.— past.Having been.Infinitive mood.To be.Now, by adding the word love to each, it will  thus:
I am loved,Thou wast loved,He was loved, &c.And so through the whole.The other auxiliary verbs are have, shall, will, , may, can. Have being the principal, we will  through the tenses of this.Present tense or time.Sing.I have, thou hast, he or she hath or has.Plur.We have, ye have, they have.Past tense.Sing.I had, thou hadst, he or she had.Plur.We had, ye had, they had.Participle present.Having.— past.Had.Infinitive mood.To have.There is still another form of English ver in, which the sign of the Infinitive mood to added to the verb do, which it is necessary to learn.Present tense.Sing.I do, thou dost, he or she doth.Plur.We do, ye do, they do.Past tense.Sing.I did, thou didst, he or she did.Plur.We did, ye did, they did.In the subsequent tenses, did is changed to do I have done, I had done, &c.Infinitive mood.To do; or to have done.Participle present.Doing.— past.Done.By rapid utterance, or poetical contraction, love is often used for loved; snatch'd for snatch dwelt for dwelled; smelt for smelled; and so on.But not to multiply rules, and burthen the learn∣er's memory with terms, the following list of regular Verbs in their present and past tenses w be sufficient to instruct. These he should well ¦member.Present time.Past.Participle.AwakeawokeawokeAbideabodeabodeBebeenbeing, beenBendbentbentBearbore, bareborneBeginbeganbegunPresent time.Past.Participle.BereavebereftbereftBeseechbesoughtbesoughtBeatbeatbeaten, beatBindboundboundBitebitbittenBleedbled, bloodedbledBlowblewblownBreakbrokebrokenBreedbredbredBringbroughtbroughtBuyboughtboughtCatchcaught, catchedcaughtChidechidchiddenChusechosechosenCleaveclave, clovecleft, clovenComecamecomeCreepcrept, creepedcreptCrowcrew, crowedcrownDaredared, durstdaredDiedieddeadDodiddoneDrawdrewdrawnDreamdreamed, dreamtdreamtDrankdrankdrunkDrivedrovedrivenDwelldwelled, dweltdweltEateat, ateeaten, eatFallfellfallenFeedfedfedFeelfeltfeltFightfoughtfoughtFindfoundfoundFleefledfledFlingflungflungPresent time.Past.Participle.Flyflew, fledflownForsakeforsookforsakenFreightfreightedfraughtGeldgelded, geltgelt, geldedGetgotgotten, gotGivegavegivenGildgilded, giltgilded, giltGirdgirded, girtgirded, girtGrindgroundgroundGowentgoneGrowgrewgrownHanghung, hangedhungHavehadhad, havingHearheardheardHelphelped, helptholpenHewhewedhewnHidhidhidden, hidHoldheldholdenKeepkeptkeptKnowknewknownLaylaidlaidLeadledledLeaveleftleftLeapleaped, leaptleaptLielaylainLoselostlostMakemademadeMeanmeantmeantMowmowedmownMeetmetmetRendrentrentRiderode, ridriddenRingrangrungRiseroserisenPresent time.Past.Participle.RunranrunSaysaidsaidSeesawseenSeeksoughtsoughtSeethesodsoddenSellsoldsoldSendsentsentShakeshookshakenShearsheared, shoreshornShewshewedshewnShineshinedshoneShootshotshotShrunkshrankshrunkSingsangsungSinksank, sunksunkSitsatsatSlayslewslainSlideslidsliddenSleepsleptsleptSlingslangslungSmellsmeltsmeltSmitesmotesmittenSpeakspokespokenSpellspelled, speltspeltSpillspilled, spiltspiltSpendspentspentSpinspanspunSpitspatspunSpringsprangsprungStandstoodstoodStickstuckstuckStingstungstungStealstolestolenStinkstankstunkPresent time.Past.Participle.StrikestruckstrickenStrivestrovestrivenSwearsworeswornSweepsweeped, sweptsweptSwellswelledswolnSwingswang, swungswungSwimswam, swumswumTaketooktook, takenTeartoretornTeachtaughttaughtTelltoldtoldThinkthoughtthoughtThrivethrovethrivenThrowthrewthrownTreadtrodtroddenWeepweptweptWinwonwonWindwoundwoundWearworewornWeavewovewovenWritewrote, writwritten, writWorkworked, wroughtwroughtWringwrungwrungThese rules premised, the great art in writing and speaking correctly, is to avoid false concords; that is, the singular number must never be coupled with the plural, &c. Also,
1. The noun or pronoun, and the verb following it, must be of the same number and person. We must not say, I were, I being the first person, were the second, but I am, both in the first person; nei∣ther should we say, thou were, thou being singular, and were plural, but thou wert, both singular.2. We must take care to use the proper word to express the right time, whether it be present or past. In the irregular verbs, the foregoing list will point out the word, in the regular ones, the termination ed will always express the past time. Thus, for example, we must not say, "he breaked the bowl," but broke it; not "he come home," but came.3. In the use of the words this and that, which in the plural number are these and those, we must take care that they agree with the number of he word they refer to. We must not say this men or that men, the one being singular, the other plural, but this or that man, these or those men. But where a noun has no singular number, we may add this or that to the plural of such words: thus we may say with propriety, "by this or that means." So nouns wanting a singular number are sometimes joined to a verb singular, but inelegantly, as, "the news is stae;" "your wages is small."4. Two or more names or things in the singular number, require the verb to be in the plural. Thus "William and John are (not is) good lads," "The sun and wind overcame (not overcome) me."5. Names of a multitude may have either a sin∣gular or a plural verb. Thus we may say, "The Parliament is or are sitting."6. When two or more nouns, of different num∣bers, follow each other with the word or or nor be∣tween them, and are equally related to a common verb; the verb should agree with the noun next it. For example, "Either the husband, the wife, or their children, are in the house", "Neither the husband, the children, nor the wife, is in the house.".7. Two negatives make an affirmative. "I wasn't good for nothing," implies, "It was good so something." "I can't eat no more," means, "can eat more."8. The participle present is frequently substituted for the Ininitive mood of a verb, and with ele∣gance. Thus, instead of "I like to work," we may say "I like working." "For he delights to walk, we may say, "He delights in walking."9. After the auxiliary verb have, it would be improper to put the past time; the participle should always follow. Thus, it would be ingrammatica to say, "I have saw, or "I have wrote;" it should be, "I have seen," or "I have written."10. When the leading adverbs are whether oeither, or must follow in the same sentence; where the leading adverb is neither, nor must follow Thus, "Whether you or I shall go, is not yet de∣termined." "Either your or I must ride." "Nei∣ther you nor I must speak."11. All repetitions of the same word, nay of words which express the same thing, are carefully to voided, except when the sense would be otherwise obscure, or when it is to excite the atten∣tion. For example, a repetition of the word from in the following sentence is allowable: the passage would not be clear without it. "It proceeds not from stupidity, or a slothful neglect, but from a generous liberality of soul. When it is to excite attention, a repetition is beautiful. "Every acti∣on, nay every attention, every design of man, is known to the Almighty."12. With respect to Adjectives, none should be used but such as are necessary to explain the subject more fully. To say burning or shining fire, is in∣elegant,
because the first idea of fire is, that it burns and shines; but if necessary, we may employ adjectives to express its other qualities, as consum∣ing, sparkling, brisk, &c.In short, the words of a sentence ought generally to be as different from one another, both in sense and sound, as the nature of the subject and the har∣mony of the period will admit. On this the beauty of a sentence depends, the sound being, as it were, an echo to the sense, and, independent of this, on the smoothness of the words, the choice of adjec∣tives, and the easy flow of its diction. And in general, the shorter the period, the more nervous and emphatical it is.An OBSERVATION or two on WRITING and READING.In writing, never use capital letters to begin a word, unless it be a proper name, or at the begin∣ning of a sentence. Note, A full stop, or note of admiration (!) or interrogation (?), always ends a sentence.If you quote an Author in his own words, always begin the quotation with a capital letter.The word I or Oh should be always written with a capital. Every word you wish to mark as em∣phatic, should begin with a capital, and have a line drawn under it; thus, Mark.In order to read well,1. Every one should read in an easy familiar tone, as if he were speaking, (expect it be a prayer,
in which case, a degree of solemnity is required) and should adapt his voice to the subject-matter he is reading.2. When reading, cast your eye forwards to the words following, that you may have seen them before you are to pronounce them. This will prevent stammering, or a disagreeable pause.3. Attend to the stops, and pause at a comma, (,) whilst you can count one; at a semicolon, (;) two; at a colon, (:) three; and at a full stop, (.) four, Notes of interrogation (?) and admiration, (!) are full stops. A line (thus, —) intimates a longer pause than that of full stop, and at every fresh paragraph we are to pause longer still.4. Never fetch or draw the breath, where there is no stop; nor pass a stop without a pause. Pause proportionably at every stop, utter each word di∣stinctly, sound the last letter of every word, read slow, and you will read very intelligibly.5. In reading a sentence, the voice should be gently raised, until you get to the middle, (and the middle of a sentence is generally marked with a colon) and then should gradually fall to the end of it: but take care, that at the end of a sentence, you drop not the voice too low, so as not to be well heard to the last word.6. In questions and passages of admiration, the voice should not fall, as at a full stop, but be kept up higher and higher to the end.7. To give spirit and energy to a sentence, the leading or principal word, should be pronounced emphatically. To find out which is the emphatical word, consider the chief design of the writer, and that word which shews such design most, is the word to be uttered emphatically.When a noun is the emphatical word, and at∣tended with an adjective, the stroke of the voice should be on the noun, and the adjective be only swelled; unless it appears that the stress is to be laid on the adjective. The emphatic words in the fol∣lowing passage are printed in Italics.Hail, Source of Beings! universal SoulOf Heav'n and Earth, essential Presence, hail!But where two words are set in opposition to each other, and one is pronounced emphatically, the other should be so too; as in the sentence. "If they attack, we will attack; for our cause is as good as theirs."The emphasis is of such importance in reading and speaking, that wrong placing it may alter the sense materially. The following line is an old ex∣ample upon this subject.Will you ride to town to-day?By laying the emphasis on will, the answer may be yes or no.By laying it on you, the answer may be, "No, but my son will."By laying it on ride, the answer may be, "I in∣tend to walk."By placing it on the word town, the answer may be, "No, I shall ride to my farm."And laying it on to-day, the answer may be, "Not until to-morrow."Last of all, lay no emphasis on words where there should none be laid; for this is as great a mark of ignorance, as not laying it where it should be laid.Rules for reading English verse.The general rule is to pronounce it, as if it wer prose, but with more deliberation; to observe th stops with great exactness, placing the accent whe it ought to be placed, (as will be shewn hereafter and the emphasis upon the proper words on each line. Though there should be no stop at the end of the line, the reader should pause whilst he can count one, merely to give notice to the hearer that the line is ended; and if the last word will bear two sounds, (as words ending in y will) give it tha which chymes best with its sister line. I mean that line with which it is designed to rhyme.For example,Were I but once from bondage free,I'd never sell my liberty.Here ty in liberty, is sounded as tee; but in the following line it should be sounded as ti.My soul ascends above the sky,And triumphs in her liberty.However, whether pronounced as tee or ti, the last syllable should be so feebly uttered, as not to fix any stop or accent upon it.If verse be read with the above attention, and still sound harsh upon the ear; the fault is not in the reader, but the poet, for those verses are not well penned, that cannot be read gracefully by the common rules of pronunciation.In verses of three syllables, the accent is to be placed on the 1st and 3d. Thus,
He´re we ma´yThin´k and pra´y,E´re that De´athSto´ps our brea´th.In verses of four syllables, the accent is to be placed on the 2d and 4th. Thus,
With ra´vish'd ea´rs,The Mo´narch hea´rs.DRYDEN.In verses of six syllables, on every other syl∣lable. Thus,
Though i´n the u´tmost pea´kAwhi´le we do´ remai´n,Amo´ngst the mou´ntains ble´ak,Expo´s'd to sle´et or ra´in,No spo´rt nor hou´rs shall brea´k,To e´xerci´se our ve´in.DRAYTON.In verses of seven syllables, in the 1st, 3d, 5th, and 7th. Thus,
