THE PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION.A POEM.THE PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION.A POEM. IN THREE BOOKS.EPICT. apud Arrian. II. 23. sculp.LONDON: Printed for R. DODSLEY at Tully's-Head in Pall-Mall. M.DCC.XLIV.The DESIGN.THERE are certain powers in human nature which seem to hold a middle place between the organs of bodily sense and the faculties of moral perception: They have been call'd by a very general name, THE POWERS OF IMAGINATION. Like the external senses, they relate to matter and motion; and at the same time, give the mind ideas analogous to those of moral approbation and dislike. As they are the inlets of some of the most exquisite pleasures we are acquainted with, men of warm and sensible tempers have sought means to recall the delightful perceptions they afford, independent of the objects which originally produc'd them. This gave rise to the imitative or designing arts; some of which, as painting and sculpture, directly copy the external appearances which were admir'd in nature; others, as music and poetry, bring them back to remembrance by signs universally establish'd and understood.But these arts, as they grew more correct and deliberate, were naturally led to extend their imitation beyond the peculiar objects of the imaginative powers; especially poetry, which making use of language as the instrument by which it imitates, is consequently become an unlimited representative of every species and mode of being. Yet as their primary intention was only to express the objects of imagination, and as they still abound chiefly in ideas of that class, they of course retain their original character, and all the different pleasures they excite, are term'd, in general, PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION.The Design of the following poem is to give a view of these, in the largest acceptation of the term; so that whatever our imagination feels from the agreeable appearances of nature, and all the various entertainment we meet with either in poetry, painting, music, or any of the elegant arts, might be deducible from one or other of those principles in the constitution of the human mind, which are here establish'd and explain'd.
In executing this general plan it was necessary first of all to distinguish the imagination from our other faculties, and then to characterize those original forms or properties of being about which it is conversant, and which are by nature adapted to it, as light is to the eyes, or truth to the understanding. These properties Mr. Addison had reduc'd to the three general classes of greatness, novelty, and beauty; and into these we may analyse every object, however complex, which, properly speaking, is delightful to the imagination. But such an object may also include many other sources of pleasure, and its beauty, or novelty, or grandeur, will make a stronger impression by reason of this concurrence. Besides this, the imitative arts, especially poetry, owe much of their effect to a similar exhibition of properties quite foreign to the imagination; insomuch that in every line of the most applauded poems, we meet with either ideas drawn from the external senses, or truths discover'd to the understanding, or illustrations of contrivance and final causes, or above all the rest, with circumstances proper to awaken and ingage the passions. It was therefore necessary to enumerate and exemplify these different species of pleasure; especially that from the passions, which as it is supreme in the noblest works of human genius, so being in some particulars not a little surprizing, gave an opportunity to inliven the didactic turn of the poem, by introducing a piece of machinery to account for the appearance.After these parts of the subject which hold chiefly of admiration, or naturally warm and interest the mind, a pleasure of a very different nature, that which arises from ridicule, came next to be consider'd. As this is the foundation of the comic manner in all the arts, and has been but very imperfectly treated by moral writers, it was thought proper to give it a particular illustration, and to distinguish the general sources from which the ridicule of characters is deriv'd. Here too a change of stile became necessary; such a one as might yet be consistent, if possible, with the general taste of composition in the serious parts of the subject: nor is it an easy task to give any tolerable force to images of this kind, without running either into the gigantic expressions of the mock-heroic, or the familiar and pointed raillery of profess'd satire; neither of which would have been proper here.The materials of all imitation being thus laid open, nothing now remain'd but to illustrate some particular pleasures which arise either from the relations of different objects one to another, or from the nature of imitation itself. Of the first kind is that various and complicated resemblance existing between several parts of the material and immaterial

worlds, which is the foundation of metaphor and wit. As it seems in a great measure to depend on the early associations of our ideas, and as this habit of associating is the source of many pleasures and pains in life, and on that account bears a great share in the influence of poetry and the other arts, it is therefore mention'd here and its effects describ'd. Then follows a general account of the production of these elegant arts, and the secondary pleasure, as it is call'd, arising from the resemblance of their imitations to the original appearances of nature. After which, the design is clos'd with some reflections on the general conduct of the powers of imagination, and on their natural and moral usefulness in life.Concerning the manner or turn of composition which prevails in this piece, little can be said with propriety by the author. He had two models; that antient and simple one of the first Graecian poets, as it is refin'd by Virgil in the Georgics, and the familiar epistolary way of Horace. This latter has several advantages. It admits of a greater variety of stile; it more readily ingages the generality of readers, as partaking more of the air of conversation; and especially with the assistance of rhyme, leads to a closer and more concise expression. Add to this the example of the most perfect of modern poets, who has so happily applied this manner to the noblest parts of philosophy, that the public taste is in a great measure form'd to it alone. Yet, after all, the subject before us tending almost constantly to admiration and enthusiasm, seem'd rather to demand a more open, pathetic and figur'd stile. This too appear'd more natural, as the author's aim was not so much to give formal precepts, or enter into the way of direct argumentation, as by exhibiting the most ingaging prospects of nature, to enlarge and harmonize the imagination, and by that means insensibly dispose the minds of men to the same dignity of taste in religion, morals, and civil life. 'Tis on this account that he is so careful to point out the benevolent intention of the author of nature in every principle of the human constitution here insisted on; and also to unite the moral excellencies of life in the same point of view with the meer external objects of good taste; thus recommending them in common to our natural propenstiy for admiring what is beautiful and lovely. The same views have also led him to introduce some sentiments which may perhaps be look'd upon as not quite direct to the subject; but since they bear an obvious relation to it, the authority of Virgil, the faultless model of didactic poetry, will best support him in this particular. For the sentiments themselves he makes no apology.ARGUMENT of the FIRST BOOK.THE subject propos'd; verse 1, to 30. Difficulty of treating it poetically; v. 45.

Conclusion.THE PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION.BOOK the FIRST.WITH what attractive charms this goodly frameOf nature touches the consenting heartsOf mortal men; and what the pleasing storesWhich beauteous imitation thence derivesTo deck the poet's, or the painter's toil;My verse unfolds. Attend, ye gentle POW'RSOF MUSICAL DELIGHT! and while I sing
Your gifts, your honours, dance around my strain.Thou, smiling queen of every tuneful breast,Indulgent FANCY! from the fruitful banksOf Avon, whence thy rosy fingers cullFresh flow'rs and dews to sprinkle on the turfWhere Shakespeare lies, be present: and with theeLet FICTION come, upon her vagrant wingsWafting ten thousand colours thro' the air,And, by the glances of her magic eye,Combining each in endless, fairy forms,Her wild creation. Goddess of the lyreWhich rules the accents of the moving sphere,Wilt thou, eternal HARMONY! descend,And join this festive train? for with thee comesThe guide, the guardian of their lovely sports,Majestic TRUTH; and where TRUTH deigns to come,Her sister LIBERTY will not be far.Be present all ye GENII who conductThe wand'ring footsteps of the youthful bard,New to your springs and shades: who touch his earWith finer sounds: who heighten to his eye
The bloom of nature, and before him turnThe gayest, happiest attitudes of things.Oft have the laws of each poetic strainThe critic-verse imploy'd; yet still unsungLay this prime subject, tho' importing mostA poet's name: for fruitless is th' attemptBy dull obedience and the curb of rules,For creeping toil to climb the hard ascentOf high Parnassus. Nature's kindling breathMust fire the chosen genius; nature's handMust point the path, and imp his eagle-wingsExulting o'er the painful steep to soarHigh as the summit: there to breathe at largeAethereal air; with bards and sages old,Immortal sons of praise. These flatt'ring scenesTo this neglected labour court my song;Yet not unconscious what a doubtful taskYet not unconscious.]Lucret. l. 2. v. 921.Nec me animi fallit quam sint obscura, sed acriPercussit thyrso laudis spes magna meum cor,Et simul incussit suavem mi in pectus amoremMusarum; quo nunc instinctus mente vigentiAvia Piëridum peragro loca, nullius anteTrita solo: juvat integros accedere fonteis,Atque haurire: juvatque novos discerpere flores;Insignem meo capiti petere inde coronam,Unde prius nulli velarint tempora Musae.
To paint the finest features of the mind,And to the most subtile and mysterious thingsGive colour, strength and motion. But the loveOf nature and the muses bids explore,Thro' secret paths erewhile untrod by man,The fair poetic region, to detectUntasted springs, to drink inspiring draughts;And shade my temples with unfading flow'rsCull'd from the laureate vale's profound recess,Where never poet gain'd a wreath before.From heav'n my strains begin; from heaven descendsThe flame of genius to the human breast,And love and beauty, and poetic joyAnd inspiration. Ere the radiant sunSprung from the east, or 'mid the vault of nightThe moon suspended her serener lamp;Ere mountains, woods, or streams adorn'd the globe;
Or wisdom taught the sons of men her lore;Then liv'd th' eternal ONE: then deep-retir'dIn his unfathom'd essence, view'd at largeThe uncreated images of things;The radiant sun, the moon's nocturnal lamp,The mountains, woods and streams, the rolling globe,And wisdom's form coelestial. From the firstOf days, on them his love divine he fix'd,His admiration: till in time compleat,What he admir'd and lov'd, his vital smileUnfolded into being. Hence the breathOf life informing each organic frame,Hence the green earth, and wild resounding waves;Hence light and shade alternate; warmth and cold;And clear autumnal skies and vernal show'rs,And all the fair variety of things.But not alike to every mortal eyeIs this great scene unveil'd. For since the claimsOf social life, to diff'rent labours urgeThe active pow'rs of man; with wise intent
The hand of nature on peculiar mindsImprints a diff'rent byass, and to eachDecrees its province in the common toil.To some she taught the fabric of the sphere,The changeful moon, the circuit of the starrs,The golden zones of heav'n: to some she gaveTo weigh the moment of eternal things,Of time, and space, and fate's unbroken chain,And will's quick impulse: others by the handShe led o'er vales and mountains, to exploreWhat healing virtue swells the tender veinsOf herbs and flow'rs; or what the beams of mornDraw forth, distilling from the clifted rindIn balmy tears. But some, to higher hopesWere destin'd; some within a finer mouldShe wrought, and temper'd with a purer flame.To these the sire omnipotent unfoldsThe world's harmonious volume, there to readThe transcript of himself. On every partThey trace the bright impressions of his hand:In earth or air, the meadow's purple stores,
The moon's mild radiance, or the virgin's formBlooming with rosy smiles, they see portray'dThat uncreated beauty, which delightsThe mind supreme. They also feel her charms,Enamour'd; they partake th' eternal joy.As Memnon's marble harp, renown'd of oldAs Memnon's marble harp.] The statue of Memnon, so famous in antiquity, stood in the temple of Serapis at Thebes, one of the great cities of old Egypt. It was of a very hard, iron-like stone, and, according to Juvenal, held in its hand a lyre, which being touch'd by the sun-beams, emitted a distinct and agreeable sound. Tacitus mentions it as one of the principal curiosities which Germanicus took notice of in his journey through Egypt,; and Strabo affirms that he, with many others, heard it.By fabling Nilus, to the quivering touchOf Titan's ray, with each repulsive stringConsenting, sounded thro' the warbling airUnbidden strains; ev'n so did nature's handTo certain species of external things,Attune the finer organs of the mind:So the glad impulse of congenial pow'rs,Or of sweet sound, or fair-proportion'd form,The grace of motion, or the bloom of light,Thrills thro' imagination's tender frame,From nerve to nerve: all naked and alive
They catch the spreading rays: till now the soulAt length discloses every tuneful spring,To that harmonious movement from without,Responsive. Then the inexpressive strainDiffuses its inchantment: fancy dreamsOf sacred fountains and Elysian groves,And vales of bliss: the intellectual pow'rBends from his awful throne a wond'ring ear,And smiles: the passions gently sooth'd away,Sink to divine repose, and love and joyAlone are waking; love and joy, sereneAs airs that fan the summer. O! attend,Whoe'er thou art whom these delights can touch,Whose candid bosom the refining loveOf nature warms, O! listen to my song;And I will guide thee to her fav'rite walks,And teach thy solitude her voice to hear,And point her loveliest features to thy view.Know then, whate'er of nature's pregnant stores,Whate'er of mimic art's reflected formsWith love and admiration thus inflame
The pow'rs of fancy, her delighted sonsTo three illustrious orders have referr'd;Three sister-graces, whom the painter's hand,The poet's tongue confesses; the sublime,The wonderful, the fair. I see them dawn!I see the radiant visions, where they rise,More lovely than when Lucifer displaysHis beaming forehead thro' the gates of morn,To lead the train of Phoebus and the spring.Say, why was man so eminently rais'dSay, why was man, &c.] In apologizing for the frequent negligence of the sublimest authors of Greece,Those god-like geniuses, says Longinus, were wellassured that nature had not intended man for a low-spirited or ignoble being: but bringing us into life and the midst of this wide universe, as before a multitude assembled at some heroic solemnity that we might be spectators of all her magnificence, and candidates high in emulation for the prize of glory; she has therefore implanted in our souls an inextinguishable love of every thing great and exalted, of every thing which appears divine beyond our comprehension. Whence it comes to pass, that even the whole world is not an object sufficient for the depth and rapidity of human imagination, which often sallies forth beyond the limits of all that surrounds us. Let any man cast his eye through the whole circle of our existence, and consider how especially it abounds in excellent and grand objects, he will soon acknowledge for what injoyments and pursuits we were destined. Thus by the very propensity of nature we are led to admire, not little springs or shallow rivulets, however clear and delicious, but the Nile, the Rhine, the Danube, and much more than all, the ocean, &c. Dionys. Longin. de Sublim. §. xxxiv.Amid the vast creation; why ordain'd
Thro' life and death to dart his piercing eye,With thoughts beyond the limit of his frame;But that th' Omnipotent might send him forthIn sight of mortal and immortal pow'rs,As on a boundless theatre, to runThe great career of justice; to exaltHis gen'rous aim to all diviner deeds;To shake each partial purpose from his breast;And thro' the mists of passion and of sense,And thro' the tossing tide of chance and painTo hold his course unfalt'ring, while the voiceOf truth and virtue, up the steep ascentOf nature, calls him to his high reward,Th' applauding smile of heav'n? Else wherefore burnsIn mortal bosoms, this unquenched hopeThat breathes from day to day sublimer things,And mocks possession? wherefore darts the mind,With such resistless ardor to embraceMajestic forms? impatient to be free,Spurning the gross controul of wilful might;Proud of the strong contention of her toils;
Proud to be daring? Who but rather turnsTo heav'n's broad fire his unconstrained view,Than to the glimm'ring of a waxen flame?Who that, from Alpine heights, his lab'ring eyeShoots round the wide horizon to surveyThe Nile or Ganges rowl his wasteful tideThro' mountains, plains, thro' empires black with shade,And continents of sand; will turn his gazeTo mark the windings of a scanty rillThat murmurs at his feet? The high-born soulDisdains to rest her heav'n-aspiring wingBeneath its native quarry. Tir'd of earthAnd this diurnal scene, she springs aloftThro' fields of air; pursues the flying storm;Rides on the volley'd lightning thro' the heav'ns;Or yok'd with whirlwinds and the northern blast,Sweeps the long tract of day. Then high she soarsThe blue profound, and hovering o'er the sun,Beholds him pouring the redundant streamOf light; beholds his unrelenting swayBend the reluctant planets to absolve
The fated rounds of time. Thence far effus'dShe darts her swiftness up the long careerOf devious comets; thro' its burning signsExulting circles the perennial wheelOf nature, and looks back on all the starrs,Whose blended light, as with a milky zone,Invests the orient. Now amaz'd she viewsTh' empyreal waste, where happy spirits hold,Th' empyreal waste.]Ne se peut-il point qu'il y a un grand espace audelà de la region des etoiles? Que ce soit le ciel empyreé, ou non, toûjours cet espace immense qui environne toute cette region, pourra être rempli de bonheur & de gloire. Il pourre être conçu comme l'ocean, où se rendent les fleuves de toutes les creatures bienheureuses, quand elles seront venues à leur perfection dans le systême des etoiles.Leibnitz dans la Theodicee, part. i. §. 19.Beyond this concave heav'n, their calm abode;And fields of radiance, whose unfading lightWhose unfading light, &c.] It was a notion of the great M. Huygens, that there may be fix'd stars at such a distance from our solar system, as that their light shall not have had time to reach us, even from the creation of the world to this day.Has travell'd the profound six thousand years,Nor yet arrives in sight of mortal things.Ev'n on the barriers of the world untir'dShe meditates th' eternal depth below;Till, half recoiling, down the headlong steep
She plunges; soon o'erwhelm'd and swallow'd upIn that immense of being. There her hopesRest at the fated goal. For from the birthOf mortal man, the sov'reign Maker said,That not in humble or in brief delight,Not in the fading echoes of renown,Pow'rs purple robes, or pleasure's flow'ry lap,The soul should find injoyment: but from theseTurning disdainful to an equal good,Thro' all th' ascent of things inlarge her view,Till every bound at length should disappear,And infinite perfection close the scene.Call now to mind what high, capacious pow'rsLie folded up in man; how far beyondThe praise of mortals, may th' eternal growthOf nature to perfection half divine,Expand the blooming soul? What pity thenShould sloth's unkindly fogs depress to earthHer tender blossom; choak the streams of life,And blast her spring! Far otherwise design'd
Almighty wisdom; nature's happy caresTh'obedient heart far otherwise incline.Witness the sprightly joy when aught unknownStrikes the quick sense, and wakes each active pow'rTo brisker measures: witness the neglectOf all familiar prospects, tho' beheld—the neglectOf all familiar prospects, &c.]It is here said, that in consequence of the love of novelty, objects which at first were highly delightful to the mind, lose that effect by repeated attention to them. But the instance of habit is oppos'd to this observation; for there, objects at first distasteful are in time render'd intirely agreeable by repeated attention.The difficulty in this case will be remov'd, if we consider, that when objects at first agreeable, lose that influence by frequently recurring, the mind is wholly passive and the perception involuntary; but habit, on the other hand. generally supposes choice and activity accompanying it: so that the pleasure arises here not from the object, but from the mind's conscious determination of its own activity; and consequently increases in proportion to the frequency of that determination.It will still be urged perhaps, that a familiarity with disagreeable objects renders them at length acceptable, even when there is no room for the mind to resolve or act at all. In this case, the appearance must be accounted for, one of these ways.The pleasure from habit may be meerly negative. The object at first gave uneasiness: this uneasinest gradually wears off as the object grows familiar; and the mind finding it at last intirely removed, reckons its situation really pleasurable, compar'd with what it had experienced before.The dislike conceiv'd of the object at first, might be owing to prejudice or want of attention. Consequently the mind being necessitated to review it often, may at length perceive its own mistake, and be reconcil'd to what it had look'd on with aversion. In which case, a sort of instinctive justice naturally leads it to make amends for the injury, by running toward th e other extreme of fondness and attachment.Or lastly, tho' the object itself should always continue disagreeable, yet circumstances of pleasure or good fortune may occur along with it. Thus an association may arise in the mind, and the object never be remember'd without those pleasing circumstances attending it; by which means the disagreeable impression it at first occasion'd will in time be quite obliterated.With transport once; the fond, attentive gazeOf young astonishment; the sober zealOf age, commenting on prodigious things.For such the bounteous providence of heav'n,In every breast implanting this desire
Of objects new and strange, to urge us on—this desireOf objects new and strange—]These two ideas are oft confounded; tho' it is evident the meer novelty of an object makes it agreeable, even where the mind is not affected with the least degree of wonder: whereas wonder indeed always implies novelty, being never excited by common or well-known appearances. But the pleasure in both cases is explicable from the same final cause, the acquisition of knowledge and inlargement of our views of nature: and on this account it is natural to treat of them together.With unremitted labour to pursueThose sacred stores that wait the ripening soul,In truth's exhaustless bosom. What need wordsTo paint its pow'r? For this, the daring youthBreaks from his weeping mother's anxious arms,In foreign climes to rove: the pensive sageHeedless of sleep, or midnight's harmful damp,Hangs o'er the sickly taper; and untir'd
The virgin follows, with inchanted step,The mazes of some wild and wond'rous tale,From morn to eve; unmindful of her form,Unmindful of the happy dress that stoleThe wishes of the youth, when every maidWith envy pin'd. Hence finally, by nightThe village-matron, round the blazing hearth,Suspends the infant-audience with her tales,Breathing astonishment! of witching rhymes,And evil spirits; of the death-bed callTo him who robb'd the widow, and devour'dThe orphan's portion; of unquiet soulsRis'n from the grave to ease the heavy guiltOf deeds in life conceal'd; of shapes that walkAt dead of night, and clank their chains, and waveThe torch of hell around the murd'rer's bed.At every solemn pause the croud recoilGazing each other speechless, and congeal'dWith shiv'ring sighs: till eager for th' event,Around the beldame all arrect they hang,Each trembling heart with grateful terrors quell'd.But lo! disclos'd in all her smiling pomp,Where BEAUTY onward moving claims the verseHer charms inspire: the freely-flowing verseIn thy immortal praise, O form divine,Smooths her mellifluent stream. Thee, BEAUTY, theeThe regal dome, and thy enlivening rayThe mossy roofs adore: thou, better sun!For ever beamest on th' inchanted heartLove, and harmonious wonder, and delightPoetic. Brightest progeny of heav'n!How shall I trace thy features? where selectThe roseate hues to emulate thy bloom?Haste then, my song, thro' nature's wide expanse,Haste then, and gather all her comeliest wealth,Whate'er bright spoils the florid earth contains,Whate'er the waters, or the liquid air,To deck thy lovely labour. Wilt thou flyWith laughing Autumn to th'Atlantic isles,Atlantic isles.] By these islands, which were also called the Fortunate, the ancients are now generally supposed to have meant the Canaries. They were celebrated by the poets for the mildness and fertility of the climate; for the gardens of the daughters of Hesperus, the brother of Atlas; and the dragon which constantly watched their golden fruit, till it was slain by the Tyrian Hercules.
And range with him th'Hesperian field, and see,Where'er his fingers touch the fruitful grove,The branches shoot with gold; where'er his stepMarks the glad soil, the tender clusters glowWith purple ripeness, and invest each hillAs with the blushes of an evening sky?Or wilt thou rather stoop thy vagrant plume,Where, gliding thro' his daughter's honour'd shades,Where gliding thro' his daughter's honour'd shades.]Daphne, the daughter of Penéus, transformed into a laurel.The smooth Penéus from his glassy floodReflects purpureal Tempe's pleasant scene?Fair Tempe! haunt belov'd of fylvan pow'rs,Of nymphs and fauns; where in the golden ageThey play'd in secret on the shady brinkWith ancient Pan: while round their choral stepsYoung hours and genial gales with constant handShow'r'd blossoms, odours, show'r'd ambrosial dews,And spring's Elysian bloom. Her flow'ry storeTo thee nor Tempe shall refuse; nor watch
Of winged Hydra guard Hesperian fruitsFrom thy free spoil. O bear then, unreprov'd,Thy smiling treasures to the green recessWhere young Dione stays. With sweetest airsIntice her forth to lend her angel-formFor beauty's honour'd image. Hither turnThy graceful footsteps; hither, gentle maid,Incline thy polish'd forehead: let thy eyesEffuse the mildness of their azure dawn;And may the fanning breezes waft asideThy radiant locks, disclosing as it bendsWith airy softness from the marble neckThe cheek fair-blooming, and the rosy lipWhere winning smiles and pleasure sweet as love,With sanctity and wisdom, temp'ring blendTheir soft allurement. Then the pleasing forceOf nature, and her kind parental care,Worthier I'd sing: then all th' enamour'd youth,With each admiring virgin to my lyreShould throng attentive, while I point on highWhere beauty's living image, like the morn
That wakes in Zephyr's arms the blushing May,Moves onward; or as Venus, when she stoodEffulgent on the pearly car, and smil'd,Fresh from the deep, and conscious of her form,To see the Tritons tune their vocal shells,And each coerulean sister of the floodWith fond acclaim attend her o'er the waves,To seek th' Idalian bow'r. Ye smiling bandOf youths and virgins, who thro' all the mazeOf young desire with rival-steps pursueThis charm of beauty; if the pleasing toilCan yield a moment's respite, hither turnYour favourable ear, and trust my words.I do not mean to wake the gloomy formOf superstition drest in wisdom's garb,To damp your tender hopes; I do not meanTo bid the jealous thund'rer fire the heav'ns,Or shapes infernal rend the groaning earthTo fright you from your joys: my chearful songWith better omens calls you to the field,Pleas'd with your gen'rous ardour in the chace,And warm as you. Then tell me, for you know,
Does beauty ever deign to dwell where healthAnd active use are strangers? Is her charmConfess'd in aught, whose most peculiar endsAre lame and fruitless? Or did nature meanThis awful stamp the herald of a lye;To hide the shame of discord and disease,And catch with fair hypocrisy the heartOf idle faith? O no! with better cares,Th' indulgent mother, conscious how infirmHer offspring tread the paths of good and ill,By this illustrious image, in each kindStill most illustrious where the object holdsIts native pow'rs most perfect, she by thisIllumes the headlong impulse of desire,And sanctifies his choice. The generous glebeWhose bosom smiles with verdure, the clear tractOf streams delicious to the thirsty soul,The bloom of nectar'd fruitage ripe to sense,And every charm of animated things,Are only pledges of a state sincere,Th' integrity and order of their frame,
When all is well within, and every endAccomplish'd. Thus was beauty sent from heav'n,The lovely ministress of truth and goodIn this dark world: for truth and good are one,And beauty dwells in them, and they in her,—Truth and good are one,And beauty dwells in them, &c.]Do you imagine, says Socrates to his libertine disciple, that what is good is not also beautiful? Have you not observ'd that these appearances always co-incide? Virtue, for instance, in the same respect as to which we call it good, is ever acknowledg'd to be beautiful also. In the characters of men we alwaysThis the Athenians did in a peculiar manner by the words .join the two denominations together. The beauty of human bodies corresponds, in like manner, with that oeconomy of parts which constitutes them good; and in all the circumstances which occurr in life, the same object is constantly accounted both beautiful and good, inasmuch as it answers the purposes for which it was design'd.Xenophont. memorab. Socrat. 1. 3. c. 8.This excellent observation has been illustrated and extended by the noble restorer of ancient philosophy; see the Characteristicks, vol. 2. p. 399. & 422. & vol. 3. p. 181. And his most ingenious disciple has particularly shewn, that it holds in the general laws of nature, in the works of art, and the conduct of the sciences. Inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue; Treat. 1. §. 8. As to the connection between beauty and truth, there are two opinions concerning it. Some philosophers assert an independent and invariable law in nature, in consequence of which all rational beings must alike perceive beauty in some certain proportions, and deformity in the contrary. And this necessity being supposed the same with that which commands the assent or dissent of the understanding, it follows of course that beauty is founded on the universal and unchangeable law of truth.But others there are who believe beauty to be meerly a relative and arbitrary thing; that indeed it was a benevolent design in nature to annex so delightful a sensation to those objects which are best and most perfect in themselves, that so we might be ingaged to the choice of them at once and without staying to infer their usefulness from their structure and effects; but that it is not impossible, in a physical sense, that two beings, of equal capacities for truth, should perceive, one of them beauty, and the other deformity, in the same relations. And upon this supposition, by that truth which is always connected with beauty, nothing more can be meant than the conformity of any object to those proportions upon which, after careful examination, the beauty of that species is found to depend. Polycletus for instance, the famous sculptor of Sicyon, from an accurate mensuration of the several parts of the most perfect human bodies, deduced a canon or system of proportions, which was the rule of all succeeding artists. Suppose a statue modell'd according to this canon. A man of meer natural taste, upon looking at it, without entering into its proportions, confesses and admires its beauty; whereas a professor of the art applies his measures to the head, the neck, or the hand, and, without attending to its beauty, pronounces the workmanship to be just and true.
With like participation. Wherefore then,O sons of earth! would you dissolve the tye?O wherefore, with a rash, imperfect aim,Seek you those flow'ry joys with which the handOf lavish fancy paints each flatt'ring sceneWhere beauty seems to dwell, nor once inquireWhere is the sanction of eternal truth,Or where the seal of undeceitful good,To save your search from folly? Wanting these,Lo! beauty withers in your void imbrace,And with the glitt'ring of an idiot's toyDid fancy mock your vows. Nor let the gleamOf youthful hope that shines upon your hearts,Be chill'd or clouded at this awful taskTo learn the lore of undeceitful good,
And truth eternal. Tho' the pois'nous charmsOf baleful superstition, guide the feetOf servile numbers, thro' a dreary wayTo their abode, thro' desarts, thorns and mire;And leave the wretched pilgrim all forlornTo muse, at last, amid the ghostly gloomOf graves, and hoary vaults, and cloister'd cells;To walk with spectres thro' the midnight shade,And to the screaming owl's accursed songAttune the dreadful workings of his heart;Yet be not you dismay'd. A gentler starYour lovely search illumines. From the groveWhere wisdom talk'd with her Athenian sons,Could my ambitious hand intwine a wreathOf PLATO'S olive with the Mantuan bay,Then should my pow'rful voice at once dispelThese monkish horrors: then in light divineDisclose th' Elysian prospect, where the stepsOf those whom nature charms, thro' blooming walks,Thro' fragrant mountains and poetic streams,Amid the train of sages, heroes, bards,
Led by their winged Genius and the choirOf laurell'd science and harmonious art,Proceed exulting to th' eternal shrine,Where truth inthron'd with her coelestial twins,The undivided part'ners of her sway,With good and beauty reigns. O let not us,Lull'd by luxurious pleasure's languid strain,Or crouching to the frowns of bigot-rage,O let not us a moment pause to joinThe god-like band. And if the gracious pow'rThat first awaken'd my untutor'd song,Will to my invocation breathe anewThe tuneful spirit; then thro' all our paths,Ne'er shall the sound of this devoted lyreBe wanting; whether on the rosy mead,When summer smiles, to warn the melting heartOf luxury's allurement; whether firmAgainst the torrent and the stubborn hillTo urge bold virtue's unremitted nerve,And wake the strong divinity of soulThat conquers chance and fate; or whether struck
For sounds of triumph, to proclaim her toilsUpon the lofty summit, round her browTo twine the wreathe of incorruptive praise;To trace her hallow'd light thro' future worlds,And bless heav'n's image in the heart of man.Thus with a faithful aim have we presum'd,Advent'rous, to delineate nature's form;Whether in vast, majestic pomp array'd,Or drest for pleasing wonder, or sereneIn beauty's rosy smile. It now remains,Thro' various being's fair-proportion'd scale,To trace the rising lustre of her charms,From their first twilight, shining forth at lengthTo full meridian splendour. Of degreeThe least and lowliest, in th'effusive warmthOf colours mingling with a random blaze,Doth beauty dwell. Then higher in the lineAnd variation of determin'd shape,Where truth's eternal measures mark the boundOf circle, cube, or sphere. The third ascent
Unites this varied symmetry of partsWith colour's bland allurement; as the pearlShines in the concave of its azure bed,And painted shells indent their speckled wreathe.Then more attractive rise the blooming formsThro' which the breath of nature has infus'dHer genial pow'r to draw with pregnant veinsNutritious moisture from the bounteous earth,In fruit and seed prolific: thus the flow'rsTheir purple honours with the spring resume;And such the stately tree which autumn bendsWith blushing treasures. But more lovely stillIs nature's charm, where to the full consentOf complicated members, to the bloomOf colour, and the vital change of growth,Life's holy flame and piercing sense are giv'n,And active motion speaks the temper'd soul:So moves the bird of Juno; so the steedWith rival ardour beats the dusty plain,And faithful dogs with eager airs of joySalute their fellows. Thus doth beauty dwell
There most conspicuous, ev'n in outward shape,Where dawns the high expression of a mind:By steps conducting our inraptur'd searchTo that eternal origin, whose pow'r,Thro' all th' unbounded symmetry of things,Like rays effulging from the parent sun,This endless mixture of her charms diffus'd.MIND, MIND alone, bear witness, earth and heav'n!The living fountains in itself containsOf beauteous and sublime: here hand in hand,Sit paramount the Graces; here inthron'd,Coelestial Venus, with divinest airs,Invites the soul to never-fading joy.Looks then abroad thro' nature, to the rangeOf planets, suns, and adamantine spheresWheeling unshaken thro' the void immense;And speak, O man! does this capacious sceneWith half that kindling majesty dilateThy strong conception, as when Brutus roseAs when Brutus rose, &c.]Cicero himself describes this fact—Caesare interfecto—statim cruentum altè extollens M.

When shall we beholdThe tuneful tongue, the Promethéan handAspire to ancient praise? Alas! how faint,How slow the dawn of beauty and of truthBreaks the reluctant shades of Gothic nightWhich yet involve the nations! Long they groan'dBeneath the furies of rapacious force;Oft as the gloomy north, with iron-swarmsTempestuous pouring from her frozen caves,
Blasted th' Italian shore, and swept the worksOf liberty and wisdom down the gulphOf all-devouring night.

They attempted both the epic ode and satire, and abounded in a wild and fantastic vein of fable, partly allegorical, and partly founded on traditionary legends of the Saracen wars. These were the rudiments of the Italian poetry. But their taste and composition must have been extremely barbarous, as we may judge by those who followed the turn of their fable in much politer times; such as Boiardo, Bernardo Tasso, Ariosto, &c.And wildly warbling scatter'd, as they flew,Their blooming wreaths from fair Valclusa'sValclusa.] The famous retreat of Francesco Petrarcha, the father of Italian poetry, and his mistress Laura, a lady of Avignon. bow'rsTo Arno'sArno.] The river which runs by Florence, the birth-place of Dante and Boccacio. myrtle border from the shore

But still the rageOf dire ambition and gigantic pow'r,—the rageOf dire ambition, &c.] This relates to the cruel wars among the republics of Italy, and the abominable politics of its little princes, about the the fifteenth century. These at last, in conjunction with the papal power, intirely extinguished the spirit of liberty in that country, and establish'd that abuse of the fine arts which has since been propagated over all Europe.From public aims and from the busy walkOf civil commerce, drove the bolder trainOf penetrating science to the cells,Where studious ease consumes the silent hourIn shadowy searches and unfruitful care.Thus from their guardians torn, the tender artsThus from their guardians torn, the tender arts, &c.] Nor were they only losers by the separation. For philosophy itself, to use the words of a noble philosopher, being thus sever'd from the sprightly arts and sciences, must consequently grow dronish, insipid, pedantic, useless, and directly opposite to the real knowledge and practice of the world. Insomuch, that a gentleman, says another excellent writer, cannot easily bring himself to like so austere and ungainly a form: so greatly is it changed from what was once the delight of the finest gentlemen of antiquity, and their recreation after the hurry of public affairs! From this condition it cannot be recovered but by uniting it once more with the works of imagination; and we have had the pleasure of observing a very great progress made towards their union in England within these few years. It is hardly possible to conceive them at a greater distance from each other than at the revolution, when Locke stood at the head of one party, and Dryden of the other. But the general spirit of liberty, which has ever since been growing, naturally invited our men of wit and genius to improve that influence which the arts of persuasion give them with the people, by applying them to subjects of importance to society. Thus poetry and eloquence became considerable; and philosophy is now of course obliged to borrow of their imbellishments, in order even to gain audience with the public.Of mimic fancy and harmonious joy,
To priestly domination and the lustOf lawless courts, their amiable toilFor three inglorious ages have resign'd,In vain reluctant: and Torquato's tongueWas tun'd for slavish paeans at the throneOf tinsel pomp; and Raphael's magic handEffus'd its fair creation to inchantThe fond adoring herd in Latian fanesTo bind belief; while on their prostrate necksThe sable tyrant plants his heel secure.But now behold! the radiant aera dawns,When freedom's ample fabric, fix'd at lengthFor endless years on Albion's happy shoreIn full proportion, once more shall extendTo all the kindred pow'rs of social blissA common mansion, a parental roof.There shall the Virtues, there shall Wisdom's train,
Their long-lost friends rejoining, as of old,Imbrace the smiling family of arts,The Muses and the Graces. Then no moreShall vice, distracting their delicious giftsTo aims abhorr'd, with high distaste and scornTurn from their charms the philosophic eye,The patriot-bosom: then no more the pathsOf public care or intellectual toil,Alone by footsteps haughty and severeIn gloomy state be trod: th' harmonious MuseAnd her persuasive sisters then shall plantTheir sheltring laurels o'er the bleak ascent,And shed their flow'rs along the rugged way.Arm'd with the lyre, already have we dar'dTo pierce divine philosophy's retreats,And teach the Muse her lore; already stroveTheir long-divided honours to unite,While temp'ring this deep argument we sangOf truth and beauty. Now the same taskImpends; now urging our ambitious toil,We hasten to recount the various springs
Of adventitious pleasure, which adjoinTheir grateful influence to the prime effectOf objects grand or beauteous, and inlargeThe complicated joy. The sweets of sense,Do they not oft with kind accession flow,To raise harmonious fancy's native charm?So while we taste the fragrance of the rose,Glows not her blush the fairer? While we viewAmid the noontide walk a limpid rillGush thro' the trickling herbage, to the thirstOf summer yielding the delicious draughtOf cool refreshment; o'er the mossy brinkShines not the surface clearer, and the wavesWith sweeter music murmur as they flow?Nor this alone; the various lot of lifeOft from external circumstance assumesA moment's disposition to rejoiceIn those delights which at a different hourWould pass unheeded. Fair the face of spring,When rural songs and odours wake the morn,
To every eye; but how much more to hisRound whom the bed of sickness long diffus'dIts melancholy gloom! how doubly fair,When first with fresh-born vigour he inhalesThe balmy breeze, and feels the blessed sunWarm at his bosom, from the springs of lifeChasing oppressive damps and languid pain!Or shall I mention, where coelestial truthHer awful light discloses, to effuseA more majestic pomp on beauty's frame?For man loves knowledge, and the beams of truthMore welcome touch his understanding's eye,Than all the blandishments of sound, his ear,Than all of taste his tongue. Nor ever yetThe melting rainbow's vernal-tinctur'd huesTo me have shone so pleasing, as when firstThe hand of science pointed out the pathIn which the sun-beams gleaming from the westFall on the watry cloud, whose darksome veilInvolves the orient; and that trickling show'r
Piercing thro' every crystalline convexOf clust'ring dew-drops to their flight oppos'd,Recoil at length where concave all behindTh' internal surface of each glassy orbRepells their forward passage into air;That thence direct they seek the radiant goalFrom which their course began; and, as they strikeIn diff'rent lines the gazer's obvious eye,Assume a diff'rent lustre, thro' the bredeOf colours changing from the splendid roseTo the pale violet's dejected hue.Or shall we touch that kind access of joy,That springs to each fair object, while we trace,Thro' all its fabric, wisdom's artful aimDisposing every part, and gaining stillBy means proportion'd her benignant end?Speak, ye, the pure delight, whose favour'd stepsThe lamp of science thro' the jealous mazeOf nature guides, when haply you revealHer secret honours: whether in the sky,
The beauteous laws of light, the central pow'rsThat wheel the pensile planets round the year;Whether in wonders of the rowling deep,Or smiling fruits of pleasure-pregnant earth,Or fine-adjusted springs of life and sense,You scan the counsels of their author's hand.What, when to raise the meditated scene,The flame of passion, thro' the struggling soulDeep-kindled, shows across that sudden blazeThe object of its rapture, vast of size,With fiercer colours and a night of shade?What? like a storm from their capacious bedThe sounding seas o'erwhelming, when the mightOf these eruptions, working from the depthOf man's strong apprehension, shakes his frameEv'n to the base; from every naked senseOf pain or pleasure dissipating allOpinion's feeble cov'rings, and the veilSpun from the cobweb-fashion of the timesTo hide the feeling heart? Then nature speaks
Her genuine language, and the words of men,Big with the very motion of their souls,Declare with what accumulated force,Th' impetuous nerve of passion urges onThe native weight and energy of things.Yet more; her honours where nor beauty claims,Nor shews of good the thirsty sense allure,From passion's pow'r alone our nature holdsFrom passion's power alone, &c.] This very mysterious kind of pleasure which is often found in the exercise of passions generally counted painful, has been taken taken notice of by several authors. Lucretius resolves it into self-love,
Suave mari magno, &c.lib. II. 1.
As if a man was never pleas'd in being moved at the distress of a tragedy, without a cool reflection that tho' these fictitious personages were so unhappy, yet he himself was perfectly at ease and in safety. The ingenious and candid author of the reflexions critiques sur la poesie & sur la peinture, accounts for it by the general delight which the mind takes in its own activity, and the abhorrence it feels of an indolent and unattentive state: And this, join'd with the moral applause of its own temper, which attends these emotions when natural and just, is certainly the true foundation of the pleasure, which as it is the origin and basis of tragedy and epic, deserved a very particular consideration in this poem.Essential pleasure. Passion's fierce illapseRouzes the mind's whole fabric; with suppliesOf daily impulse keeps th' elastic pow'rsIntensely poiz'd, and polishes anewBy that collision all the fine machine:Else rust would rise, and foulness, by degrees
Incumb'ring, choak at last what heav'n design'dFor ceaseless motion and a round of toil.—But say, does every passion men endureThus minister delight? That name indeedBecomes the rosy breath of love; becomesThe radiant smiles of joy, th' applauding handOf admiration: but the bitter show'rThat sorrow sheds upon a brother's grave,But the dumb palsy of nocturnal fear,Or those consuming fires that gnaw the heartOf panting indignation, find we thereTo move delight?—Then listen, while my tongueTh' unalter'd will of heav'n with faithful aweReveals; what old Harmodious wont to teachMy early age; Harmodius, who had weigh'dWithin his learned mind whate'er the schoolsOf wisdom, or thy lonely-whisp'ring voice,O faithful nature! dictate of the lawsWhich govern and support this mighty frameOf universal being. Oft the hoursFrom morn to eve have stole unmark'd away,
While mute attention hung upon his lips,As thus the sage his awful tale began.'Twas in the windings of an ancient wood,When spotless youth with solitude resignsTo sweet philosophy the studious day,What time pale autumn shades the silent eve,Musing I rov'd. Of good and evil much,And much of mortal man my thought revolv'd;When starting full on fancy's gushing eye,The mournful image of Parthenia's fate,That hour, O long belov'd and long deplor'd!When blooming youth, nor gentlest wisdom's arts,Nor Hymen's honours gather'd for thy brow,Nor all thy lover's, all thy father's tearsAvail'd to snatch thee from the cruel grave;Thy agonizing looks, thy last farewelStruck to the inmost feeling of my soulAs with the hand death. At once the shadeMore horrid nodded o'er me, and the windsWith hoarser murm'ring shook the branches. Dark
As midnight storms, the scene of human thingsAppear'd before me; desarts, burning sands,Where the parch'd adder dies; the frozen south,And desolation blasting all the westWith rapine and with murder: tyrant-pow'rHere sits inthron'd in blood; the baleful charmsOf superstition there infect the skies,And turn the sun to horror. Gracious heav'n!What is the life of man? Or cannot these,Not these portents thy awful will suffice?That propagated thus beyond their scope,They rise to act their cruelties anewIn my afflicted bosom, thus decreedThe universal sensitive of pain,The wretched heir of evils not its own!Thus I, impatient; when at once effus'd,A flashing torrent of coelestial dayBurst thro' the shadowy void. With slow descentA purple cloud came floating thro' the sky,And pois'd at length within the circling trees,
Hung obvious to my view: till opening wideIts lucid orb, a more than human formEmerging lean'd majestic o'er my head,And instant thunder shook the conscious grove.Then melted into air the liquid cloud,And all the shining vision stood reveal'd.A wreath of palm his ample forehead bound,And o'er his shoulder, mantling to his knee,Flow'd the transparent robe, around his waistCollected with a radiant zone of goldAethereal: there in mystic signs ingrav'd,I read his office high and sacred name,Genius of human kind. Appall'd I gaz'dThe godlike presence; for athwart his browDispleasure, temper'd with a mild concern,Look'd down reluctant on me, and his wordsLike distant thunders broke the murm'ring air.Vain are thy thoughts, O child of mortal birth,And impotent thy tongue. Is thy short spanCapacious of this universal frame?
Thy wisdom all-sufficient? Thou, alas!Dost thou aspire to judge between the lordOf nature and his works? to lift thy voiceAgainst the sov'reign order he decreedAll good and lovely? to blaspheme the bandsOf tenderness innate and social love,Holiest of things! by which the general orbOf being, as with adamantine links,Was drawn to perfect union and sustain'dFrom everlasting? Hast thou felt the pangsOf soft'ning sorrow, of indignant zealSo grievous to the soul, as thence to wishThe ties of nature broken from thy frame;That so thy selfish, unrelenting heartMay cease to mourn its lot, no longer thenThe wretched heir of evils not its own?O fair benevolence of gen'rous minds!O man by nature form'd for all mankind!He spoke; abash'd and silent I remain'd,As conscious of my lips' offence, and aw'd
Before his presence, tho' my secret soulDisdain'd the imputation. On the groundI fix'd my eyes; till from his airy couchHe stoop'd sublime, and touching with his handMy dazzled forehead, Raise thy sight, he cry'd,And let thy sense convince thy erring tongue.I look'd, and lo! the former scene was chang'd;For verdant alleys and surrounding trees,A solitary prospect, wide and wild,Rush'd on my senses. 'Twas a horrid pileOf hills with many a shaggy forest mix'd,With many a sable cliff and glitt'ring stream.Aloft recumbent o'er the hanging ridge,The brown woods wav'd, while ever-trickling springsWash'd from the naked roots of oak and pine,The crumbling soil; and still at every fallDown the steep windings of the channel'd rock,Remurm'ring rush'd the congregated floodsWith hoarser inundation; till at lastThey reach'd a grassy plain, which from the skirts
Of that high desart spread her verdant lap,And drank the gushing moisture, where confin'dIn one smooth current, o'er the lilied valeClearer than glass it flow'd. Autumnal spoilsLuxuriant spreading to the rays of morn,Blush'd o'er the cliffs, whose half-incircling moundAs in a sylvan theatre inclos'dThat flow'ry level. On the river's brinkI spy'd a fair pavilion, which diffus'dIts floating umbrage 'mid the silver shadeOf osiers. Now the western sun reveal'dBetween two parting cliffs his golden orb,And pour'd across the shadow of the hills,On rocks and floods, a yellow stream of lightThat chear'd the solemn scene. My list'ning pow'rsWere aw'd, and every thought in silence hung,And wond'ring expectation. Then the voiceOf that coelestial pow'r, the mystic showDeclaring, thus my deep attention call'd.Inhabitant of earth, to whom is giv'nInhabitant of earth, &c.] The account of the oeconomy of providence here introduced, as the most proper to calm and satisfy the mind, when under the compunction of private evils, seems to have come originally from the Pythagorean school: but of all the ancient philosophers, Plato has most largely insisted upon it, has established it with all the strength of his capacious understanding, and ennobled it with all the magnificence of his divine imagination. He has one passage so full and clear on the head, that I am persuaded the reader will be pleased to see it here, tho' somewhat long. Addressing himself to such as are not satisfied concerning divine providence, The being who presides over the whole, says he, has dispos'd and complicated all things for the happiness and virtue of the whole, every part of which, according to the extent of its influence, does and suffers what is fit and proper. One of these parts is yours, O unhappy man! which tho' in itself most inconsiderable and minute, yet being connected with the universe, ever seeks to co-operate with that supreme order. You in the mean time are ignorant of the very end for which all particular natures are brought into existence, that the all-comprehending nature of the whole may be perfect and happy; existing, as it does, not for your sake, but the cause and reason of your existence, which, as in the symmetry of every artificial work, must of necessity concur with the general design of the artist, and be subservient to the whole of which it is a part. Your complaint therefore is ignorant and groundless; since according to the various energy of creation, and the common laws of nature, there is a constant provision of that which is best at the same time for you and for the whole.—For the governing intelligence clearly beholding all the actions of animated and selfmoving creatures, and that mixture of good and evil which diversifies them, considering first of all by what disposition of things, and what situation of each individual in the general system, vice might be depressed and subdued, and virtue made secure of victory and happiness with the greatest facility and in the highest degree possible. In this manner he order'd thro' the entire circle of being, the internal constitution of every mind, where should be its station in the universal fabric, and thro' what variety of circumstances it should proceed in the whole tenour of its existence. He goes on in his sublime manner to assert a future state of retribution, as well for those who, by the exercise of good dispositions being harmonized and assimilated to the divine virtue, are consequently removed to a place of unblemish'd sanctity and happiness; as of those who by the most flagitious arts have arisen from contemptible beginnings to the greatest affluence and power, and whom therefore you look upon as unanswerable instances of negligence in the Gods, because you are ignorant of the purposes to which they are subservient, and in what manner they contribute to that supreme intention of good to the whole.Plato de Leg. x. 16.This theory has been deliver'd of late, especially abroad, in a manner which subverts the freedom of human actions; whereas Plato appears very careful to preserve it, and has been in that respect imitated by the best of his followers.The gracious ways of providence to learn,Receive my sayings with a stedfast ear—Know then, the sov'reign spirit of the world,Tho' self-collected from eternal time,Within his own deep essence he beheldThe circling bounds of happiness unite;Yet by immense benignity inclin'd 
To spread around him that primaeval joyWhich fill'd himself, he rais'd his plastic arm,And sounded thro' the hollow depth of spaceThe strong, creative mandate. Strait aroseThese heav'nly orbs, the glad abodes of lifeEffusive kindled by his breath divineThro' endless forms of being. Each inhal'dFrom him its portion of the vital flame,In measure such, that from the wide complexOf coexistent orders, one might rise,One order, all-involving and intire.—one might rise,One order, &c.]See the meditations of Antoninus, and the characteristics, passim.He too beholding in the sacred lightOf his essential reason, all the shapesOf swift contingence, all successives tiesOf action propagated thro' the sumOf possible existence, he at once,Down the long series of eventful time,So fix'd the dates of being, so dispos'd,To every living soul of every kind,The field of motion and the hour of rest,That all conspir'd to his supreme design,To universal good: with full accordAnsw'ring the mighty model he had chose,The best and fairest of unnumber'd worldsThe best and fairest, &c.] This opinion is so old, that Timaeus Locrus calls the supreme being, , the artificer of that which is best; and represents him as resolving in the beginning to produce the most excellent work, and as copying the world most exactly from his own intelligible and essential idea; so that it yet remains, as it was at first, perfect in beauty, and will never stand in need of any correction or improvement. There is no room for a cauiton here, to understand these expressions not of any particular circumstances of human life separately consider'd, but of the sum or universal system of life and being. See also the vision at the end of the Theodicée of Leibnitz.That lay from everlasting in the store
Of his divine conceptions. Nor content,By one exertion of creating pow'rHis goodness to reveal; thro' every age,Thro' every moment up the tract of time,His parent-hand with ever-new increaseOf happiness and virtue has adorn'dThe vast harmonious frame: his parent-hand,From mute shell-fish gasping on the shore,To men, to angels, to coelestial minds,For ever leads the generations onTo higher scenes of being; while supply'dFrom day to day by his enlivening breath,Inferior orders in succession riseTo fill the void below. As flame ascends,As flame ascends, &c.] This opinion, tho' not held by Plato or any of the ancients, is yet a very natural consequence of his principles. But the disquisition is too complex and extensive to be enter'd upon here.As bodies to their proper center move,As the poiz'd ocean to th' attracting moonObedient swells, and every headlong streamDevolves its winding waters to the main;So all things which have life aspire to GOD,
The sun of being, boundless, unimpair'd,Center of souls! Nor does the faithful voiceOf nature cease to prompt their eager stepsAright; nor is the care of heav'n witheldFrom granting to the task proportion'd aid;That in their stations all may persevereTo climb th' ascent of being, and approachFor ever nearer to the life divine.That rocky pile thou see'st, that verdant lawnFresh-water'd from the mountains.

Coelestial footsteps from his green abode.Oft from the radiant honours of his throne,He sent whom most he lov'd, the sov'reign fair,The effluence of his glory, whom he plac'dBefore his eyes for ever to behold;The goddess from whose inspiration flowsThe toil of patriots, the delight of friends;Without whose work divine, in heav'n or earth,Nought lovely, nought propitious comes to pass,Nor hope, nor praise, nor honour. Her the sireGave it in charge to rear the blooming mind,The folded pow'rs to open, to directThe growth luxuriant of his young desires,And from the laws of this majestic worldTo teach him what was good. As thus the nymphHer daily care attended, by her sideWith constant steps her gay companion stay'd,The fair Euphrosyné, the gentle queenOf smiles, and graceful gladness, and delightsThat chear alike the hearts of mortal menAnd pow'rs immortal. See the shining pair!
Behold, where from his dwelling now disclos'd,They quit their youthful charge and seek the skies.I look'd, and on the flow'ry turf there stood,Between two radiant forms, a smiling youthWhose tender cheeks display'd the vernal flow'rOf beauty; sweetest innocence illum'dHis bashful eyes, and on his polish'd browSate young simplicity. With fond regardHe view'd th' associates, as their steps they mov'd;The younger chief his ardent eyes detain'd,With mild regret invoking her return.Bright as the star of evening she appear'dAmid the dusky scene. Eternal youthO'er all her form its glowing honours breath'd;And smiles eternal, from her candid eyes,Flow'd like the dewy lustre of the mornEffusive trembling on the placid waves.The spring of heav'n had shed its blushing spoilsTo bind her sable tresses: full diffus'dHer yellow mantle floated in the breeze;And in her hand she wav'd a living branch
Rich with immortal fruits, of pow'r to calmThe wrathful heart, and from the bright'ning eyesTo chase the cloud of sadness. More sublimeThe heav'nly part'ner mov'd. The prime of ageCompos'd her steps. The presence of a god,High on the circle of her brow inthron'd,From each majestic motion darted awe,Devoted awe! till, cherish'd by her looksBenevolent and meek, confiding loveTo filial rapture soften'd all the soul.Free in her graceful hand she poiz'd the swordOf chaste dominion. An heroic crownDisplay'd the old simplicity of pompAround her honour'd head. A matron's robe,White as the sunshine streams thro' vernal clouds,Her stately form invested. Hand in handTh' immortal pair forsook th' enamell'd green,Ascending slowly. Rays of limpid lightGleam'd round their path; coelestial sounds were heard,And thro' the fragrant air aethereal dewsDistill'd around them; till at once the clouds
Disparting wide in midway sky, withdrewTheir airy veil, and left a bright expanseOf empyréan flame, where spent and drown'd,Afflicted vision plung'd in vain to scanWhat object it involv'd. My feeble eyesIndur'd not. Bending down to earth I stood,With dumb attention. Soon a female voice,As watry murmurs sweet, or warbling shades,With sacred invocation thus began.Father of gods and mortals! whose right armWith reins eternal guides the moving heav'ns,Bend thy propitious ear. Behold well-pleas'dI seek to finish thy divine decree.With frequent steps I visit yonder seatOf man, thy offspring; from the tender seedsOf justice and of wisdom, to evolveThe latent honours of his generous frame;Till thy conducting hand shall raise his lotFrom earth's dim scene to these aethereal walks,The temple of thy glory. But not me,
Not my directing voice he oft requires,Or hears delighted: this inchanting maid,Th' associate thou hast giv'n me, her aloneHe loves, O father! absent, her he craves;And but for her glad presence ever join'd,Rejoices not in mine: that all my hopesThis thy benignant purpose to fulfil,I deem uncertain; and my daily caresUnfruitful all and vain, unless by theeStill farther aided in the work divine.She ceas'd; a voice more awful thus reply'd.O thou! in whom for ever I delight,Fairer than all th' inhabitants of heaven,Best image of thy author! far from theeBe disappointment, or distaste, or blame;Who soon or late shalt every work fulfil,And no resistance find. Is man refuseTo hearken to thy dictates; or allur'dBy meaner joys, to any other pow'rTransfer the honours due to thee alone;
That joy which he pursues he ne'er shall taste,That pow'r in whom delighteth ne'er behold.Go then once more, and happy be thy toil;Go then! but let not this thy smiling friendPartake thy footsteps. In her stead, behold!With thee the son of Nemesis I send;The fiend abhorr'd! whose vengeance takes accountOf sacred order's violated laws.See where he calls thee, burning to be gone,Fierce to exhaust the tempest of his wrathOn yon devoted head. But thou, my child,Controul his cruel frenzy, and protectThy tender charge. That when despair shall graspHis agonizing bosom, he may learn,Then he may learn to love the gracious handAlone sufficient in that hour of ill,To save his feeble spirit; then confessThy genuine honours, O excelling fair!When all the plagues that wait the deadly willOf this avenging daemon, all the stormsOf night infernal, serve but to display
The energy of thy superior charmsWith mildest awe triumphant o'er his rage,And shining clearer in the horrid gloom.Here ceas'd that awful voice, and soon I feltThe cloudy curtain of refreshing eveWas clos'd once more, from that immortal fireShelt'ring my eye-lids. Looking up, I view'dA vast gigantic spectre striding onThro' murm'ring thunders and a waste of clouds,With dreadful action. Black as night his browRelentless frowns involv'd. His savage limbsWith sharp impatience violent he writh'd,As thro' convulsive anguish; and his handArm'd with a scorpion-lash, full oft he rais'dIn madness to his bosom; while his eyesRain'd bitter tears, and bellowing loud he shookThe void with horror. Silent by his sideThe virgin came. No discomposure stirr'dHer features. From the glooms which hung around,No stain of darkness mingled with the beam
Of her divine effulgence. Now they stoopUpon the river-bank; and now to hailHis wonted guests, with eager steps advanc'dThe unsuspecting inmate of the shade.As when a famish'd wolf, that all night longHad rang'd the Alpine snows, by chance at mornSees from a cliff incumbent o'er the smokeOf some lone village, a neglected kidThat strays along the wild for herb or spring;Down from the winding ridge he sweeps amain,And thinks he tears him: so with tenfold rage,The monster sprung remorseless on his prey.Amaz'd the stripling stood; with panting breastFeebly he pour'd the lamentable wailOf helpless consternation, struck at once,And rooted to the ground. The queen beheldHis terror, and with looks of tend'rest careAdvanc'd to save him. Soon the tyrant feltHer awful pow'r. His keen, tempestuous armHung nerveless, nor descended where his rage
Had aim'd the deadly blow: then dumb retir'dWith sullen rancour. Lo! the sov'reign maidFolds with a mother's arms the fainting boy,Till life rekindles in his rosy cheek;Then grasps his hand, and chears him with her tongue.O wake thee, rouze thy spirit! Shall the spiteOf yon tormentor thus appall thy heart,While I, thy friend and guardian, am at handTo rescue and to heal? O let thy soulRemember, what the will of heav'n ordainsIs ever good for all; and if for all,Then good for thee. Nor only by the warmthAnd soothing sunshine of delightful things,Do minds grow up and flourish. Oft misledBy that blind light, the young unpractis'd viewsOf reason wander thro' a fatal road,Far from their native aim: as if to lyeInglorious in the fragrant shade, and waitThe soft access of ever-circling joys,Were all the end of being. Ask thyself,
This pleasing error did it never lullThy wishes? Has thy constant heart refus'dThe silken fetters of delicious ease?Or when divine Euphrosyné appear'dWithin this dwelling, did not thy desiresHang far below that measure of thy fate,Which I reveal'd before thee? and thy eyes,Impatient of my counsels, turn awayTo drink the soft effusion of her smiles?Know then, for this the everlasting ireDeprives thee of her presence, and instead,O wise and still benevolent! ordainsThis horrid visage hither to pursueMy steps; that so thy nature may discernIts real good, and what alone can saveThy feeble spirit in this hour of illFrom folly and despair. O yet belov'd!Let not this headlong terror quite o'erwhelmThy scatter'd pow'rs; nor fatal deem the rageOf this tormentor, nor his proud assault,While I am here to vindicate thy toil,
Above the generous question of thy arm.Brave by thy fears, and in thy weakness strong,This hour he triumphs; but confront his might,And dare him to the combat, then with easeDisarm'd and quell'd, his fierceness he resignsTo bondage and to scorn: while thus inur'dBy watchful danger, by unceasing toil,Th' immortal mind, superior to his fate,Amid the outrage of external things,Firm as the solid base of this great world,Rests on his own foundations. Blow, ye winds!Ye waves! ye thunders! rowl your tempest on;Shake, ye old pillars of the marble sky!Till all its orbs and all its worlds of fireBe loosen'd from their seats; yet still serene,Th' unconquer'd mind looks down upon the wreck,And ever stronger as the storms advance,Firm thro' the closing ruin holds his way,Where nature calls him to the destin'd goal.So spake the goddess; while thro' all her frameCoelestial raptures flow'd, in every word,In ev'ry motion kindling wrath divineTo seize who listen'd. Vehement and swiftAs light'ning fires the aromatic shadeIn Aethiopian fields, the stripling feltHer inspiration catch his fervid soul,And starting from his languor thus exclaim'd.Then let the trial come! and witness thou,If terror be upon me; if I shrinkTo meet the storm, or faulter in my strengthWhen hardest it besets me. Do not thinkThat I am fearful and infirm of soul,As late thy eyes beheld: for thou hast chang'dMy nature; thy commanding voice has wak'dMy languid pow'rs to bear me boldly on,Where'er the will divine my path ordainsThro' toil or peril: only do not thouForsake me; O be thou for ever near,
That I may listen to thy sacred voice,And guide by thy decrees my constant feet.But say, for ever are my eyes bereft?Say, shall the fair Euphrosyné not onceAppear again to charm me? Thou, in heav'n!O thou eternal arbiter of things!Be thy great bidding done: for who am ITo question thy appointment? Let the frownsOf this avenger every morn o'ercastThe chearful dawn, and every evening dampWith double night my dwelling; I will learnTo hail them both, and unrepining bearHis hateful presence: but permit my tongueOne glad request, and if my deeds may findThy awful eye propitious, O restoreThe rosy-featur'd maid; again to chearThis lonely seat, and bless me with her smiles.He spoke; when instant, thro' the sable gloomsWith which that furious presence had involv'dThe ambient air, a flood of radiance cameSwift as the light'ning-flash; the melting clouds
Flew diverse, and amid the blue sereneEuphrosyné appear'd. With sprightly stepThe nymph alighted on th' irriguous lawn,And to her wond'ring audience thus begun.Lo! I am here to answer to your vows,And be the meeting fortunate! I comeWith joyful tidings; we shall part no more—Hark! how the gentle Echo from her cellTalks thro' the cliffs, and murm'ring o'er the streamRepeats the accent; we shall part no more.O my delightful friends! well-pleas'd on highThe father has beheld you, while the mightOf that stern foe with bitter trial prov'dYour equal doings: then for ever spakeThe high decree: that thou, coelestial maid!Howe'er that griesly phantom on thy stepsMay sometimes dare intrude, yet never moreShalt thou descending to th' abode of man,Alone indure the rancour of his arm,Or leave thy lov'd Euphrosyné behind.
She ended; and the whole romantic sceneImmediate vanish'd: rocks, and woods, and rills,The mantling tent, and each mysterious formFlew like the pictures of a morning dream,When sun-shine fills the bed. A while I stoodPerplex'd and giddy; till the radiant pow'rWho bade the visionary landscape rise,As up to him I turn'd, with gentlest looksPreventing my inquiry, thus began.There let thy soul acknowledge its complaintHow blind, how impious! There behold the waysOf heav'n's eternal destiny to man,For ever just, benevolent and wise:That VIRTUE'S awful steps, howe'er pursuedBy vexing fortune and intrusive PAIN,Should never be divided from her chast,Her fair attendant, PLEASURE. Need I urgeThy tardy thought thro' all the various roundOf this existence, that thy soft'ning soulAt length may learn what energy the hand
Of virtue mingles in the bitter tideOf passion swelling with distress and pain,To mitigate the sharp with gracious dropsOf cordial pleasure? Ask the faithful youth,Why the cold urn of her whom long he lov'dSo often fills his arms; so often drawsHis lonely footsteps at the silent hour,To pay the mournful tribute of his tears?O! he will tell thee, that the wealth of worldsShould ne'er seduce his bosom to foregoThat sacred hour, when stealing from the noiseOf care and envy, sweet remembrance soothsWith virtue's kindest looks his aking breast,And turns his tears to rapture—Ask the croudWhich flies impatient from the village-walkTo climb the neighb'ring cliffs, when far belowThe cruel winds have hurl'd upon the coastSome helpless bark; while sacred pity meltsThe general eye, or terror's icy handSmites their distorted limbs and horrent hair;While every mother closer to her breast
Catches her child, and pointing where the wavesFoam thro' the shatter'd vessel, shrieks aloudAs one poor wretch that spreads his piteous armsFor succour, swallow'd by the roaring surge,As now another, dash'd against the rock,Drops lifeless down: O deemest thou indeedNo kind indearment here by nature giv'nTo mutual terror and compassion's tears?No sweetly-melting softness which attracts,O'er all that edge of pain, the social pow'rsTo this their proper action and their end?—Ask thy own heart; when at the midnight hour,Slow thro' that studious gloom thy pausing eyeLed by the glimm'ring taper moves aroundThe sacred volumes of the dead: the songsOf Graecian bards, and records wrote by fameFor Graecian heroes, where the present pow'rOf heav'n and earth surveys th' immortal page,Ev'n as a father blessing, while he reads,The praises of his son. If then thy soul,Spurning the yoke of these inglorious days,

The spacious west,And all the teeming regions of the southHold not a quarry, to the curious flightOf knowledge, half so tempting or so fair,
As man to man. Nor only where the smilesOf love invite; nor only where th' applauseOf cordial honour turns th' attentive eyeOn virtue's graceful deeds. For since the courseOf things external acts in different waysOn human apprehensions, as the handOf nature temper'd to a different framePeculiar minds; so haply where the pow'rsOf fancy neither lessen nor enlarge—where the pow'rsOf fancy, &c.] The influence of the imagination on the conduct of life is one of the most important points in moral philosophy. It were easy by an induction of facts to prove that the imagination directs almost all the passions, and mixes with almost every circumstance of action or pleasure. Let any man, even of the coldest head and soberest industry, analyse the idea of what he calls his interest; he will find that it consists chiefly of certain images of decency, beauty and order, variously combined into one system, the idol which he seeks to injoy by labour, hazard, and self-denial. It is on this account of the last consequence to regulate these images by the standard of nature and the general good; otherwise the imagination, by heightening some objects beyond their real excellence and beauty, or by representing others in a more odious or terrible shape than they deserve, may of course engage us in pursuits utterly inconsistent with the laws of the moral order.If it be objected, that this account of things supposes the passions to be merely accidental, whereas there appears in some a natural and hereditary disposition to certain passions prior to all circumstances of education or fortune; it may be answer'd, that tho' no man is born ambitious or a miser, yet he may inherit from his parents a peculiar temper or complexion of mind, which shall render his imagination more liable to be struck with some particular objects, consequently dispose him to form opinions of good and ill, and entertain passions of a particular turn. Some men, for instance, by the original frame of their minds, are more delighted with the vast and magnificent, others on the contrary with the elegant and gentle aspects of nature. And it is very remarkable, that the disposition of the moral powers is always similar to this of the imagination; that those who are most inclin'd to admire prodigious and sublime objects in the physical world, are also most inclin'd to applaud examples of fortitude and heroic virtue in the moral. While those who are charm'd rather with the delicacy and sweetness of colours, and forms, and sounds, never fail in like manner to yield the preference to the softer scenes of virtue and the sympathies of a domestic life. And this is sufficient to account for the objection.Among the ancient philosophers, tho' we have several hints concerning this influence of the imagination upon morals among the remains of the Socratic school, yet the Stoics were the first who paid it a due attention. Zeno, their founder, thought it impossible to preserve any tolerable regularity in life, without frequently inspecting those pictures or appearances of things which the imagination offers to the mind. (Diog. Laert. l. vii.) The meditations of M. Aurelius, and the discourses of Epictetus, are full of the same sentiments; insomuch that this latter makes the , or right management of the fancys, the only thing for which we are accountable to providence, and without which a man is no other than stupid or frantic. Arrian. l. i. c. 12. & l. ii. c. 22. See also the Characteristics, vol. 1. from p. 313, to p. 321. where this Stoical doctrine is embellished with all the eloquence and graces of Plato.The images of things, but paint in all
Their genuine hues, the features which they woreIn nature; there opinion will be true,And action right. For action treads the pathIn which opinion says he follows good,Or flies from evil; and opinion givesReport of good or evil, as the sceneWas drawn by fancy, lovely or deform'd:Thus her report can never there be true,Where fancy cheats the intellectual eye,
With glaring colours and distorted lines.Is there a man, who at the sound of death,Sees ghastly shapes of terror conjur'd up,And black before him; nought but death-bed groans,And fearful pray'rs, and plunging from the brinkOf light and being, down the gloomy air,An unknown depth? Alas! in such a mind,If no bright forms of excellence attendThe image of his country; nor the pompOf sacred senates, nor the guardian voiceOf justice on her throne, nor aught that wakesThe conscious bosom with a patriot's flame;Will not opinion tell him, that to die,Or stand the hazard, is a greater illThan to betray his country? And in actWill he not chuse to be a wretch and live?Here vice begins then. From th' inchanting cupWhich fancy holds to all, th' unwary thirstOf youth oft swallows a Circaean draught,That sheds a baleful tincture o'er the eyeOf reason, till no longer he discerns,
And only guides to err. Then revel forthA furious band that spurn him from the throne;And all is uproar. Thus ambition graspsThe empire of the soul: thus pale revengeUnsheaths her murd'rous dagger; and the handsOf lust and rapine, with unholy arts,Watch to o'erturn the barrier of the lawsThat keeps them from their prey: thus all the plaguesThe wicked bear, or o'er the trembling sceneThe tragic muse discloses, under shapesOf honour, safety, pleasure, ease or pomp,Stole first into the mind. Yet not by allThose lying forms which fancy in the brainEngenders, are the kindling passions driv'nTo guilty deeds; nor reason bound in chains,That vice alone may lord it: oft adorn'dWith solemn pageants, folly mounts his throne,And plays her ideot-anticks, like a queen.A thousand garbs she wears; a thousand waysShe wheels her giddy empire.—Lo! thus farWith bold adventure, to the Mantuan lyre
I sing of nature's charms, and touch well-pleas'dA stricter note: now haply must my songUnbend her serious measure, and revealIn lighter strains, how folly's aukward arts—how folly's aukward arts, &c.] Notwithstanding the general influence of ridicule on private and civil life, as well as on learning and the sciences, it has been almost constantly neglected or misrepresented, by divines especially. The manner of treating these subjects in the science of human nature, should be precisely the same as in natural philosophy; from particular facts to investigate the stated order in which they appear, and then apply the general law, thus discovered, to the explication of other appearances and the improvement of useful arts.Excite impetuous laughter's gay rebuke;The sportive province of the comic muse.See! in what crouds the uncouth forms advance,Each would outstrip the other, each preventOur careful search, and offer to your gaze,Unask'd, his motley features. Wait awhile,My curious friends! and let us first arrangeIn proper orders your promiscuous throng.Behold the foremost band; of slender thought,Behold the foremost band, &c.] The first and most general source of ridicule in the characters of men, is vanity or self-applause for some desirable quality or possession which evidently does not belong to those who assume it.And easy faith; whom flatt'ring fancy sooths
With lying spectres, in themselves to viewIllustrious forms of excellence and good,That scorn the mansion. With exulting heartsThey spread their spurious treasures to the sun;And bid the world admire! but chief the glanceOf wishful envy draws their joy-bright eyes,And lists with self-applause each lordly brow.In number boundless as the blooms of spring,Behold their glaring idols, empty shadesBy fancy gilded o'er, and then set upFor adoration. Some in learning's garb,With formal band and sable-cinctur'd gown,And rags of mouldy volumes. Some elateWith martial splendour, steely pikes, and swordsOf costly frame, and gay Phoenician robesInwrought with flow'ring gold, assume the portOf stately valour: list'ning by his sideThere stands a female form; to her, with looksOf earnest import, pregnant with amaze,He talks of deadly deeds, of breaches, storms,And sulph'rous mines, and ambush: then at once
Breaks off, and smiles to see her look so pale,And asks some wond'ring question of her fears.Others of graver mien; behold, adorn'dWith holy ensigns, how sublime they move,And bending oft their sanctimonious eyes,Take homage of the simple-minded throng;Ambassadors of heav'n! Nor much unlikeIs he whose visage, in the lazy mistThat mantles every feature, hides a broodOf politic conceits; of whispers, nods,And hints deep-omen'd with unwieldy schemes,And dark portents of state. Ten thousand more,Prodigious habits and tumultuous tongues,Pour dauntless in and swell the boastful band.Then comes the second order; all who seekThen comes the second order, &c.] Ridicule from the same vanity, where tho' the possession be real, yet no merit can arise from it, because of some particular circumstances, which, tho' obvious to the spectator, are yet overlook'd by the ridiculous character.The debt of praise, where watchful unbeliefDarts thro' the thin pretence her squinting eye
On some retir'd appearance which beliesThe boasted virtue, or annulls th' applauseThat justice else would pay. Here side by sideI see two leaders of the solemn train,Approaching: one a female, old and grey,With eyes demure and wrinkle-furrow'd brow,Pale as the cheeks of death; yet still she stunsThe sickning audience with a nauseous tale;How many youths her myrtle chains have worn,How many virgins at her triumphs pin'd!Yet how resolv'd she guards her cautious heart;Such is her terror at the risques of love,And man's seducing tongue! The other seemsA bearded sage, ungentle in his mien,And sordid all his habit; peevish wantGrins at his heels, while down the gazing throngHe stalks, resounding in magnific phraseThe vanity of riches, the contemptOf pomp and pow'r. Be prudent in your zeal,Ye grave associates! let the silent graceOf her who blushes at the fond regard
Her charms inspire, more eloquent unfoldThe praise of spotless honour: let the manWhose eye regards not his illustrious pompAnd ample store, but as indulgent streamsTo chear the barren soil and spread the fruitsOf joy, let him by juster measure fixThe price of riches and the end of pow'r.Another tribe succeeds; deluded longAnother tribe succeeds, &c.] Ridicule from a notion of excellence in particular objects disproportion'd to their intrinsic value, and inconsistent with the order of nature.By fancy's dazzling optics, these beholdThe images of some peculiar thingsWith brighter hues resplendent, and portray'dWith features nobler far than e'er adorn'dTheir genuine objects. Hence the fever'd heartPants with delirious hope for tinsel charms;Hence oft obtrusive on the eye of scorn,Untimely zeal her witless pride betrays;And serious manhood, from the tow'ring aim
Of wisdom, stoops to emulate the boastOf childish toil. Behold yon mystic form,Bedeck'd with feathers, insects, weeds and shells!Not with intenser brow the Samian sageBent his fix'd eye on heav'n's eternal fires,When first the order of that radiant sceneSwell'd his exulting thought, than this surveysA muckworm's entrails or a spider's fang.Next him a youth, with flow'rs and myrtles crown'd,Attends that virgin form, and blushing kneels,With fondest gesture and a suppliant's tongue,To win her coy regard: adieu, for him,The dull ingagements of the bustling world!Adieu the sick impertinence of praise!And hope, and action! for with her alone,By streams and shades, to steal the sighing hours,Is all he asks, and all that fate can give!Thee too, facetious Momion, wandring here,Thee, dreaded censor! oft have I beheldBewilder'd unawares: alas! too longFlush'd with thy comic triumphs and the spoils
Of sly derision! till on every sideHurling thy random bolts, offended truthAssign'd thee here thy station with the slavesOf folly. Thy once formidable nameShall grace her humble records, and be heardIn scoffs and mock'ry bandied from the lipsOf all the vengeful brotherhood around,So oft the patient victims of thy scorn.But now, ye gay! to whom indulgent fate,But now ye gay, &c.] Ridicule from a notion of excellence, where the object is absolutely odious or contemptible. This is the highest degree of the ridiculous; as in the affectation of diseases or vices.Of all the muse's empire hath assign'dThe fields of folly, hither each advanceYour sickles; here the teeming soil affordsIts richest growth. A fav'rite brood appears;In whom the daemon, with a mother's joy,Views all her charms reflected, all her caresAt full repay'd. Ye most illustrious band!Who scorning reason's tame, pedantic rules,And order's vulgar bondage, never meant
For souls sublime as yours, with generous zealPay vice the rev'rence virtue long usurp'd,And yield deformity the fond applauseWhich beauty wont to claim; forgive my song,That for the blushing diffidence of youth,It shuns the unequal province of your praise.Thus far triumphant in the pleasing guileThus far triumphant, &c.] Ridicule from false shame or groundless fear.Of bland imagination, folly's trainHave dar'd our search: but now a dastard-kindAdvance reluctant, and with fault'ring feetShrink from the gazer's eye: infeebled hearts,Whom fancy chills with visionary fears,Or bends to servile tameness with conceitsOf shame, of evil, or of base defect,Fantastic and delusive. Here the slaveWho droops abash'd when sullen pomp surveysHis humbler habit: here the trembling wretchUnnerv'd and froze with terror's icy boltsSpent in weak wailings, drown'd in shameful tears,
At every dream of danger: here subduedBy frontless laughter and the hardy scornOf old, unfeeling vice, the abject soulWho blushing half resigns the candid praiseOf temperance and honour; half disownsA freeman's hatred of tyrannic pride;And hears with sickly smiles the venal mouthWith foulest licence mock the patriot's name.Last of the motley bands on whom the pow'rLast of the, &c. Ridicule from the ignorance of such things as our circumstances require us to know.Of gay derision bends her hostile aim,Is that where shameful ignorance presides.Beneath her sordid banners, lo! they march,Like blind and lame. Whate'er their doubtful handsAttempt, confusion strait appears behind,And troubles all the work. Thro' many a maze,Perplex'd they struggle, changing every path,O'erturning every purpose; then at lastSit down dismay'd, and leave th'entangled scene
For scorn to sport with. Such then is th'abodeOf folly in the mind; and such the shapesIn which she governs her obsequious train.Tho' every scene of ridicule in thingsTo lead the tenour of my devious lay;Thro' every swift occasion, which the handOf laughter points at, when the mirthful stingDistends her sallying nerves and choaks her tongue;What were it but to count each crystal dropWhich morning's dewy fingers on the bloomsOf May distill? Suffice it to have said,—suffice it to have said, &c.] By comparing these general sources of ridicule with each other, and examining the ridiculous in other objects, we may obtain a general definition of it equally applicable to every species. The most important circumstance of this definition is laid down in the lines referr'd to; but others more minute we shall subjoin here. Aristotle's account of the matter seems both imperfect and false; , says he, : the ridiculous is some certain fault or turpitude without pain, and not destructive to its subject.(Poetic. c. v.) For allowing it to be true, as it is not, that the ridiculous is never accompany'd with pain, yet we might produce many instances of such a fault or turpitude which cannot with any tolerable propriety be called ridiculous. So that the definition does not distinguish the thing defined. Nay farther, even when we perceive the turpitude tending to the destruction of its subject, we may still be sensible of a ridiculous appearance, till the ruin become imminent and the keener sensations of pity or terror banish the ludicrous apprehension from our minds. For the sensation of ridicule is not a bare perception of the agreement or disagreement of ideas; but a passion or emotion of the mind consequential to that perception. So that the mind may perceive the agreement or disagreement, and yet not feel the ridiculous, because it is engrossed by a more violent emotion. Thus it happens that some men think those objects ridiculous, to which others cannot endure to apply the name; because in them they excite a much intenser and more important feeling. And this difference, among other causes, has brought a good deal of confusion into this question.That which makes objects ridiculous is some ground of admiration or esteem connected with other more general circumstances, comparatively worthless or deformed; or it is some circumstance of turpitude or deformity connected with what is in general excellent or beautiful: the inconsistent properties existing either in the objects themselves, or in the apprehension of the person to whom they relate; belonging always to the same order or class of being, implying sentiment or design; and exciting no acute or vehement emotion of the heart.To prove the several parts of this definition: The appearance of excellence or beauty connected with a general condition comparatively sordid or deformed, is ridiculous; for instance, pompous pretensions to wisdom join'd with ignorance and folly in the Socrates of Aristophanes; and the applause of military glory with cowardice and stupidity in the Thraso of Terence.The appearance of deformity or turpitude in conjunction with what is in general excellent or venerable, is also ridiculous: for instance, the personal weaknesses of a magistrate appearing in the solemn and public functions of his station.The incongruous properties may either exist in the objects themselves, or in the apprehension of the person to whom they relate: in the last-mention'd instances they both exist in the objects; in the instance from Aristophanes and Terence, one of them is objective and real, the other only founded in the apprehension of the ridiculous character.The inconsistent properties must belong to the same order or class of being. A coxcomb in fine cloaths bedaubed by accident in foul weather, is a ridiculous object; because his general apprehension of excellence and esteem is referr'd to the splendour and expence of his dress. A man of sense and merit in the same circumstances, is not counted ridiculous; because the general ground of excellence and esteem in him, is, both in fact and in his own apprehension, of a very different species.Every ridiculous object implies sentiment or design. A column placed by an architect without a capital or base, is laugh'd at: the same column in a ruin causes a very different sensation.And lastly, the occurrence must excite no acute or vehement emotion of the heart, such as terror, pity, or indignation; for in that case, as was observ'd above, the mind is not at leisure to contemplate the ridiculous.Whether any appearance not ridiculous be involved in this description, and whether it comprehend every species and form of the ridiculous, must be determined by repeated applications of it to particular instances.Where'er the pow'r of ridicule displays
Her quaint-ey'd visage, some incongruous form,Some stubborn dissonance of things combin'd,Strikes on the quick observer: whether pomp,
Or praise, or beauty mix their partial claimWhere sordid fashions, where ignoble deeds,Where foul deformity are wont to dwell,Or whether these with violation loath'd,Invade resplendent pomp's imperious mien,The charms of beauty, or the boast of praise.Ask we for what fair end,Ask we for what fair end, &c.] Since it is beyond all contradiction evident that we have a natural sense or feeling of the ridiculous, and since so good a reason may be assign'd to justify the supreme being for bestowing it; one cannot without astonishment reflect on the conduct of those men who imagine it is for the service of true religion to vilify and blacken it without distinction, and endeavour to persuade us that it is never applied but in a bad cause. Ridicule is not concerned with meer speculative truth or falsehood. It is not in abstract propositions or theorems, but in actions and passions, good and evil, beauty and deformity, that we find materials for it; and all these terms are relative, implying approbation or blame. To ask then whether ridicule be a test of truth, is, in other words, to ask whether that which is ridiculous can be morally true, can be just and becoming; or whether that which is just and becoming, can be ridiculous. A question that does not deserve a serious answer. For it is most evident, that as in a metaphysical proposition offer'd to the understanding for its assent, the faculty of reason examines the terms of the proposition, and finding one idea which was supposed equal to another, to be in fact unequal, of consequence rejects the proposition as a falsehood: so in objects offer'd to the mind for its esteem or applause, the faculty of ridicule feeling an incongruity in the claim, urges the mind to reject it with laughter and contempt. When therefore we observe such a claim obtruded upon mankind, and the inconsistent circumstances carefully concealed from the eye of public, it is our business, if the matter be of importance to society, to drag out those latent circumstances, and by setting them full in view, convince the world how ridiculous the claim is; and thus a double advantage is gained; for we both detect the moral falsehood sooner than in the way of speculative inquiry, and impress the minds of men with a stronger sense of the vanity and error of its authors. And this and no more is meant by the application of ridicule.But it is said, the practice is dangerous, and may be inconsistent with the regard we owe to objects of real dignity and excellence. I answer, the practice fairly managed can never be dangerous; men may be dishonest in obtruding circumstances foreign to the object, and we may be inadvertent in allowing those circumstances to impose upon us; but the sense of ridicule always judges right: the Socrates of Aristophanes is as truly ridiculous a character as ever was drawn.—True; but it is not the character of Socrates, the divine moralist and father of ancient wisdom. What then? did the ridicule of the poet hinder the philosopher from detecting and disclaiming those foreign circumstances which he had falsely introduced into his character, and thus rendering the satirist doubly ridiculous in his turn? No: but it nevertheless had an ill influence on the minds of the people. And so has the reasoning of Spinoza made many atheists; he has founded it indeed on suppositions utterly false, but allow him these, and his conclusions are unavoidably true. And if we must reject the use of ridicule, because by the imposition of false circumstances, things may be made to seem ridiculous, which are not so in themselves; why we ought not in the same manner to reject the use of reason, because by proceeding on false principles, conclusions will appear true which are impossible in nature, let the vehement and obstinate declaimers against ridicule determine. th' almighty sireIn mortal bosoms wakes this gay contempt,
These grateful stings of laughter, from disgustEducing pleasure? Wherefore, but to aidThe tardy steps of reason, and at onceBy this prompt impulse urge us to depressThe giddy aims of folly? Tho' the lightOf truth slow-dawning on th' inquiring mind,
At length unfolds, thro' many a subtile tie,How these uncouth disorders end at lastIn public evil; yet benignant heav'nConscious how dim the dawn of truth appearsTo thousands; conscious what a scanty pauseFrom labours and from care, the wider lotOf humble life affords for studious thoughtTo scan the maze of nature; therefore stamptThe glaring scenes with characters of scorn,As broad, as obvious to the passing clown,As to the letter'd sage's curious eye.Such are the various aspects of the mind—Some heav'nly genius, whose unclouded thoughtsAttain that secret harmony which blendsTh' aethereal spirit with its mold of clay;O! teach me to reveal the grateful charmThat searchless nature o'er the sense of manDiffuses, to behold, in lifeless things,The inexpressive semblanceThe inexpressive semblance, &c.] This similitude is the foundation of almost all the ornaments of poetic diction. of himself,
Of thought and passion. Mark the sable woodsThat shade sublime yon mountain's nodding brow;With what religious awe the solemn sceneCommands your steps! as if the reverend formOf Minos or of Numa should forsakeTh' Elysian seats, and down th' imbow'ring gladeMove to your pausing eye! Behold th' expanseOf yon gay landscape, where the silver cloudsFlit o'er the heav'ns before the sprightly breeze:Now their grey cincture skirts the doubtful sun;Now streams of splendor, thro' their opening veilEffulgent, sweep from off the gilded lawnTh' aerial shadows; on the curling brook,And on the shady margin's quiv'ring leavesWith quickest lustre glancing: while you viewThe prospect, say, within your chearful breastPlays not the lively sense of winning mirthWith clouds and sunshine chequer'd, while the roundOf social converse, to th' inspiring tongueOf some gay nymph amid her subject-train,Moves all obsequious? Whence is this effect,
This kindred pow'r of such discordant things?Or flows their semblance from that mystic toneTo which the new-born mind's harmonious pow'rsAt first were strung? Or rather from the linksWhich artful custom twines around her frame?For when the diff'rent images of thingsBy chance combin'd, have struck th' attentive soulWith deeper impulse, or connected long,Have drawn her frequent eye; howe'er distinctTh' external scenes, yet oft th' ideas gainFrom that conjunction an eternal tie,And sympathy unbroken. Let the mindRecall one partner of the various league,Immediate, lo! the firm confed'rates rise,And each his former station strait resumes:One movement governs the consenting throng,And all at once with rosy pleasure shine,Or all are sadden'd with the glooms of care.'Twas thus, if ancient fame the truth unfold,
Two faithful needles, from th' informing touchTwo faithful needles, &c.] See the elegant poem recited by Cardinal Bembo in the character of Lucretius; Strada Prolus. vi. Academ. 2. c. 5.Of the same parent-stone, together drewIts mystic virtue, and at first conspir'dWith fatal impulse quiv'ring to the pole;Then, tho' disjoin'd by kingdoms, tho' the mainRowl'd its broad surge betwixt, and diff'rent starsBeheld their wakeful motions, yet preserv'dThe former friendship, and remember'd stillTh' alliance of their birth: whate'er the lineWhich one possess'd, nor pause, nor quiet knewThe sure associate, ere with trembling speedHe found its path and fix'd unerring there.Such is the secret union, when we feelA song, a flow'r, a name at once restoreThose long-connected scenes where first they mov'dTh' attention; backward thro' her mazy walksGuiding the wanton fancy to her scope,To temples, courts or fields; with all the bandOf painted forms, of passions and designs
Attendant: whence, if pleasing in itself,The prospect from that sweet accession gainsRedoubled influence o'er the list'ning mind.By these mysterious ties the busy pow'rBy these mysterious ties, &c.] The act of remembring seems almost wholly to depend on the association of ideas.Of mem'ry her ideal train preservesIntire; or when they would elude her watch,Reclaims their fleeting footsteps from the wasteOf dark oblivion; thus collecting allThe various forms of being to present,Before the curious aim of mimic art,Their largest choice: like spring's unfolded bloomsExhaling sweetness, that the skillful beeMay taste at will, from their selected spoilsTo work her dulcet food. For not th' expanseOf living lakes in summer's noontide calm,Reflects the bord'ring shade and sun-bright heav'nsWith fairer semblance; not the sculptur'd goldMore faithful keeps the graver's lively trace,Than he whose birth the sister-pow'rs of art
Propitious view'd, and from his genial starShed influence to the seeds of fancy kind;Than his attemper'd bosom must preserveThe seal of nature. There alone unchang'd,Her form remains. The balmy walks of MayThere breathe perennial sweets: the trembling chordResounds for ever in th' abstracted ear,Melodious; and the virgin's radiant eye,Superior to disease, to grief, and time,Shines with unbating lustre. Thus at lengthIndow'd with all that nature can bestow,The child of fancy oft in silence bendsO'er these mix'd treasures of his pregnant breast,With conscious pride. From them he oft resolvesTo frame he knows not what excelling things;And win he knows not what sublime rewardOf praise and wonder. By degrees the mindFeels her young nerves dilate: the plastic pow'rsLabour for action: blind emotions heaveHis bosom; and with loveliest frenzy caught,From earth to heav'n he rolls his daring eye,
From heav'n to earth. Anon ten thousand shapes,Like spectres trooping to the wisard's call,Fleet swift before him. From the womb of earthFrom ocean's bed they come: th' eternal heav'nsDisclose their splendors, and the dark abyssPours out her births unknown. With fixed gazeHe marks the rising phantoms. Now comparesTheir diff'rent forms; now blends them, now divides;Inlarges and extenuates by turns;Opposes, ranges in fantastic bands,And infinitely varies. Hither now,Now thither fluctuates his inconstant aim,With endless choice perplex'd. At length his planBegins to open. Lucid order dawns;And as from Chaos old the jarring seedsOf nature at the voice divine repair'dEach to its place, till rosy earth unveil'dHer fragrant bosom, and the joyful sunSprung up the blue serene; by swift degreesThus disentangled, his entire designEmerges. Colours mingle, features join,
And lines converge: the fainter parts retire;The fairer eminent in light advance;And every image on its neighbour smiles.A while he stands, and with a father's joyContemplates. Then with Promethéan art,Into its proper vehicle he breathesInto its proper vehicle, &c.] This relates to the different sorts of corporeal mediums, by which the ideas of the artist are rendered palpable to the senses; as by sounds, in music; by lines and shadows, in painting; by diction, in poetry, &c.The fair conception; which imbodied thus,And permanent, becomes to eyes or earsAn object ascertain'd: while thus inform'd,The various organs of his mimic skill,The consonance of sounds, the featur'd rock,The shadowy picture and impassion'd verse,Beyond their proper pow'rs attract the soulBy that expressive semblance, while in sightOf nature's great original we scanThe lively child of art; while line by line,And feature after feature we referTo that sublime exemplar whence it stoleThose animating charms. Thus beauty's palm
Betwixt 'em wav'ring hangs: applauding loveDoubts where to chuse; and mortal man aspiresTo tempt creative praise. As when a cloudOf gath'ring hail with limpid crusts of iceInclos'd and obvious to the beaming sun,Collects his large effulgence; strait the heav'nsWith equal flames present on either handThe radiant visage: Persia stands at gaze,Appall'd; and on the brink of Ganges waitsThe snowy-vested seer, in Mithra's name,To which the fragrance of the south shall burn,To which his warbled orisons ascend.Such various bliss the well-tun'd heart injoys,Favour'd of heav'n! While plung'd in sordid cares,Th' unfeeling vulgar mocks the boon divine:And harsh austerity, from whose rebukeYoung love and smiling wonder shrink away,Abash'd and chill of heart, with sager frownsCondemns the fair inchantment. On, my strain,Perhaps ev'n now some cold, fastidious judge
Casts a disdainful eye; and calls my toil,And calls the love and beauty which I sing,The dream of folly. Thou grave censor! say,Is beauty then a dream, because the gloomsOf dullness hang too heavy on thy senseTo let her shine upon thee? So the manWhose eye ne'er open'd on the light of heav'n,Might smile with scorn while raptur'd vision tellsOf the gay, colour'd radiance flushing brightO'er all creation. From the wise be farSuch gross, unhallow'd pride; nor needs my songDescend so low; but rather now unfold,If human thought could reach, or words unfold,By what mysterious fabric of the mind,The deep-felt joys and harmony of soundResult from airy motion; and from shapeThe lovely phantoms of sublime and fair.By what fine ties hath GOD connected thingsWhen present in the mind; which in themselvesHave no connection? Sure the rising sun,O'er the caerulean convex of the sea,With equal brightness and with equal warmth
Might rowl his fiery orb; nor yet the soulThus feel her frame expanded, and her pow'rsExulting in the splendor she beholds;Like a young conqu'ror moving thro' the pompOf some triumphal day. When join'd at eve,Soft-murm'ring streams and gales of gentlest breathMelodious Philomela's wakeful strainAttemper, could not man's discerning earThro' all its tones the symphony pursue;Nor yet this breath divine of nameless joySteal thro' his veins and fan th'awaken'd heart,Mild as the breeze, yet rapt'rous as the song?But were not nature still indow'd at largeWith all which life requires, tho' unadorn'dWith such inchantment? Wherefore then her formSo exquisitely fair? her breath perfum'dWith such aethereal sweetness? Whence her voiceInform'd at will to raise or to depressTh' impassion'd soul? and whence the robes of lightWhich thus invest her with more lovely pomp
Than fancy can describe? Whence but from thee,O source divine of ever-flowing love,And thy unmeasur'd goodness? Not contentWith every food of life to nourish man,By kind illusions of the wond'ring senseThou mak'st all nature beauty to his eye,Or music to his ear: well-pleas'd he scansThe goodly prospect; and with inward smilesTreads the gay verdure of the painted plain;Beholds the azure canopy of heav'n,And living lamps that over-arch his headWith more than regal splendor; bends his earsTo the full choir of water, air, and earth;Nor heeds the pleasing error of his thought,Nor doubts the painted green or azure arch,Nor questions more the music's mingling soundsThan space, or motion, or eternal time:So sweet he feels their influence to attractThe fixed soul; to brighten the dull gloomsOf care, and make the destin'd road of lifeDelightful to his feet. So fables tell,
Th' advent'rous heroe, bound on hard exploits,Beholds with glad surprize, by secret spellsOf some kind sage, the patron of his toils,A visionary paradise disclos'dAmid the dubious wild: with streams, and shades,And airy songs, th' enchanted landscape smiles,Chears his long labours and renews his frame.What then is taste, but these internal pow'rsActive, and strong, and feelingly aliveTo each fine impulse? a discerning senseOf decent and sublime, with quick disgustFrom things deform'd, or disarrang'd, or grossIn species? This, nor gems, nor stores of gold,Nor purple state, nor culture can bestow;But GOD alone, when first his active handImprints the secret byass of the soul.He, mighty parent! wise and just in all,Free as the vital breeze or light of heav'n,Reveals the charms of nature. Ask the swainWho journeys homeward from a summer day'sLong labour, why, forgetful of his toils
And due repose, he loiters to beholdThe sunshine gleaming as thro' amber clouds,O'er all the western sky; full soon, I ween,His rude expression and untutor'd airs,Beyond the pow'r of language, will unfoldThe form of beauty smiling at his heart,How lovely! how commanding! But tho' heav'nIn every breast hath sown these early seedsOf love and admiration, yet in vain,Without fair culture's kind parental aid,Without inlivening suns, and genial show'rs,And shelter from the blast, in vain we hopeThe tender plant should rear its blooming head,Or yield the harvest promis'd in its spring.Nor yet will every soil with equal storesRepay the tiller's labour; or attendHis will, obsequious, whether to produceThe olive or the laurel. Diff'rent mindsIncline to different objects: one pursuesThe vast alone, the wonderful, the wild;—One pursuesThe vast alone, &c.] See the note to ver. 18 of this book.
Another sighs for harmony, and grace,And gentlest beauty. Hence when lightning firesThe arch of heav'n, and thunders rock the ground;When furious whirlwinds rend the howling air,And ocean, groaning from the lowest bed,Heaves his tempestuous billows to the sky;Amid the mighty uproar, while belowThe nations tremble, Shakespear looks abroadFrom some high cliff, superior, and enjoysThe elemental war. But Waller longs,Waller longs, &c.]O! how I long my careless limbs to layUnder the plantane shade; and all the dayWith am'rous airs my fancy entertain, &c.WALLER, Battle of the Summer-Islands.

Joins in his plaint, melodious; mute the groves;And hill and dale with all their echoes mourn.Such and so various are the tastes of men.Oh! blest of heav'n, whom not the languid songsOf luxury, the Siren! not the bribesOf sordid wealth, nor all the gaudy spoilsOf pageant honour can seduce to leaveThose ever-blooming sweets, which from the storeOf nature fair imagination cullsTo charm th' inliven'd soul! What tho' not allOf mortal offspring can attain the heightsOf envied life; tho' only few possessPatrician treasures or imperial state;Yet nature's care, to all her children just,With richer treasures and an ampler stateIndows at large whatever happy manWill deign to use them. His the city's pomp,The rural honours his. Whate'er adornsThe princely dome, the column and the arch,The breathing marbles and the sculptur'd gold,
Beyond the proud possessor's narrow claim,His tuneful breast injoys. For him, the springDistills her dews, and from the silken gemIts lucid leaves unfolds: for him, the handOf autumn tinges every fertile branchWith blooming gold and blushes like the morn.Each passing hour sheds tribute from her wings;And still new beauties meet his lonely walk;And loves unfelt attract him. Not a breeze—Not a breeze, &c.] That this account may not appear rather poetically extravagant than just in philosophy, it may be proper to produce the sentiment of one of the greatest, wisest, and best of men on this article; one so little to be suspected of partiality in the case, that he reckons it among those favours for which he was especially thankful to the gods, that they had not suffered him to make any great proficiency in the arts of eloquence and poetry, lest by that means he should have been diverted from pursuits of more importance to his high station. Speaking of the beauty of universal nature, he observes that there is a pleasing and graceful aspect in every object we perceive, when once we consider its connection with that general order. He instances in many things which at first sight would be thought rather deformities, and then adds, that a man who enjoys a sensibility of temper with a just comprehension of the universal order—will discern many amiable things, not credible to every mind, but to those alone who have entered into an honourable familiarity with nature and her works.M.

Would the formsOf servile custom cramp her generous pow'rs?Would sordid policies, the barb'rous growthOf ignorance and rapine, bow her down
