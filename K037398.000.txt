Five PASTORAL ECLOGUES: The SCENES of which are Suppos'd to lie among the SHEPHERDS, oppress'd by the WAR in Germany.Impius hoec tam culta novalia Miles habebit?Barbaras has segetes? En quo discordia civesPerduxit miseros! en queis consevimus agros!VIRGIL.LONDON: Printed for R. DODSLEY at Tully's Head in Pall-mall. M.DCC.XLV. [Price One Shilling.]PREFACE.IT is generally thought, that as Pastorals are a kind of poetry, which has been touch'd upon by such a number of poets, that they are easily compos'd, and that their thoughts and sentiments must be trite and vulgar. However this opinion may be true in reason, I hope the following pieces will be exempt from it's censure, as they are form'd on a plan entirely new, and as their design is essentially distinguish'd from any productions of their kind, either ancient or modern: unless it be that the first and ninth Bucolic of Virgil are in the same nature. How the ideas of fields and woods, and a poetry whose very essence is a rural life, will agree with the polite taste of the town, and of gentlemen who are more conversant in the fashionable ornaments of life, is a question: but I hope as they relate to that war, which is at present the most general topic of conversation, this unpoliteness will in some measure be excused.
The learned reader will observe, that the author has endeavour'd to imitate the simplicity of the ancients in these pieces, as thinking it not only more particularly adapted to Pastoral, but the true ornament of all kinds of poetry in general. As to the design of this work, I hope it will not be thought odd, or ill-chosen. The opposing interests of a peaceful and rural life, and the tumultuous scenes of war, together with the various struggles and passions arising from thence, seem by no means an improper field for the most elegant writer to exercise his genius in. How far the author of these pieces has succeeded in the performance of this, is humbly submitted to the censure and judgment of the public.ECLOGUE THE FIRST.LYCAS and ALPHON.ALPH.ARISE, my Lycas: in yon' woody wildsFrom a rough rock in deep enclosure hidOf thickest oaks, a gushing fountain falls,And pours it's airy stream with torrent pure:Which late returning from the field at eveI found, invited by it's dashing sound,As thro' the gloom it struck my passing ear.Thither I mean to drive our languid flocks;Fit place to cool their thirst in mid-day hour.Due west it rifes from that blasted beech;The way but short:—come, Lycas, rouze thy dog;Let us be gone.LYC.Alas, my friend, of flock,Of spring, or shepherd's lore, to me is vainTo tell: my fav'rite lamb, the solace dearOf these grey locks, my sweet and sole delight, Is snatch'd by cruel fate! an armed bandOn neighing steeds elate, in wide arrayTrampled the youngling, as the vale alongAt eve they pass'd, beneath their whelming march.ALPH.Such throng I heard, as in the neighb'ring woodI wander'd to reduce a straggling eweEscap'd the fold: what time the griesly owlHer shrieks began, and at the wonted elmThe cows awaiting stood Lucilla's hand.When strait with sudden fear alarm'd I start,And list'ning to the distant-echoing stepsOf unseen horsemen with attentive ear,I stand aloof. But why this deep-felt grief?Merits such loss these tears and black despair?LYC.Alphon, no more to Lycas now remains,Since he my last and latest care is lost!Thou know'st my little flock; three tender ewesWere all my mean ambition wish'd or sought.Ev'n now nine days, and nine revolving nightsAre past, since these the Moldaw's raging floodSwept with their wattled cotes, as o'er it's banks It rose redundant, swoln with beating rains,And deep immers'd beneath it's whirling wave.I wak'd at early dawn, and to the fieldI issus'd to pursue my wonted toil,When lo! nor flocks, nor wattled cotes I saw;But all that met my wond'ring eyes around,Was desolation sad. Here stateliest oaksTorn from their roots, with broken branches layIn hideous ruin: there the fields, that laugh'dWith rip'ning corn, of all their charms despoil'd,With oozy fragments scatter'd waste and wildWere seen. I curst the wicked spirit drear,That in the ruin'd abbey's darkest cell,(That stands immur'd amid yon' lonesome pines)I bound with triple chains: his magic pow'rOft'times with howling storms, and thunder loudDeforms the night, and blackens nature's face.His tempests swell'd the Moldaw's rising streams,And thus o'erwhelm'd my flock.—But this my heartHad learn'd to bear, at length to comfort's voiceIt had obey'd, and all it's woes forgot; When ah! too soon returning woes invadeMy breast, just rising from its former stroke.When this, the sole survivor, of my flock,Follows his lost companions; while a wretchI here remain, deserted and forlorn!He too had dy'd beneath the whelming surge,Had not the shelter of my low-rooft cottThat fatal night preserv'd him; where at eveI hap'ly plac'd him with providing care,Lest the fell storm, which yet from southern cloudsThreaten'd destruction, and to low'r began,Might violate his tender-blooming age.ALPH.With piteous eye, and sympathizing heart,Thy tears I view.—These scenes of war and blood,The calm repose of every field invade!Myself had fall'n a victim to their rage,As in deep dead of night my cave beneathI lay dissolv'd in sleep, with warning voiceHad not my dog alarm'd with wond'ring ear.When strait approach'd the cave a savage throngWith barb'rous arms, and habit fierce and wild, With stern demeanour and defying lookTerrify; which the moon's pale-glimm'ring raysPresented to my sight, as in the boughs,Close shrouded, of a neighb'ring pine I sat(Where sudden fear had driv'n me to evade Impending fate, unconscious
and amaz'd)Secure, but trembling, and in chilly dampsMy limbs bedew'd.—The monsters as they past,With dire confusion all the cavern fill'd;Hurl'd to the ground my scrip, and beechen cup,Dispers'd the shaggy skins that form my bed,And o'er the trampled floor had scatter'd wideA hoard of choicest chesnuts, which I cull'dWith nice-discerning care, and had design'dA present to my beauteous ROSALINDE.Alas! with them her love had been obtain'd,And me to MYRON she had then preferr'd!LYC.Shepherd, on thee has fortune kindly smil'd;'Tis mine to feel her grief-inflicting hand!Alas! each object that I view aroundRecalls my perish'd darling to my sight, And mocks me with his loss! see there the
springWhere oft he wont to flake his eager thirst!And there the beech, beneath whose breezy shadeHe lov'd to lie, close covert from the sun!See yet the bark smooth-worn and bare remains,Where oft the youngling rubb'd his tender side!Ah! what avail'd my care, and foresight vain?That day he fell oppress'd by whelming steeds.This hand had built a bow'r of thickest boughsCompos'd, and wove with intermingling leaves,Impervious to the sun; and strew'd the floorWith choicest hay, that in the secret shadeHe might repose, nor feel the dog-star's beam!But why this sad, repeated track of woeI still pursue? Farewel, my ALPHON dear,To distant fields, and pastures will I go,Where impious war, and discord, nurse of blood,Shall ne'er profane the silence of the groves.ECLOGUE the SECOND.ACIS and ALCYON.ACIS.WHILE in the bosom of this deep recessThe voice of war has lost its madding shouts,Let us improve the transient hour of peace,And calm our troubled minds with mutual songs;While this recess conspiring with the museInvites to peaceful thoughts; this cavern deep,And these tall pines that nodding from the rockWave o'er its mouth their umbrage black, and castA venerable gloom, with this clear fountThat cleaves the riven stone and fills the caveWith hollow-tinkling sounds. Repeat the songWhich late, ALCYON, from thy mouth I heard,As to the spring we drove our thirsting flocks;It tells the charms of grateful evening mild:Begin, ALCYON: ACIS in returnShall sing the praises of the dawning morn.ALCY.Behind the hills when sinks the western sun,And falling dews breath fragrance thro' the air,Refreshing every field with coolness mild;Then let me walk the twilight meadows green,Or breezy up-lands, near thick-branching elms,While the still landschape sooths my soul to rest,And every care subsides to calmest peace:The mists slow-rising from the rivers dank,The woods scarce stirring at the whisp'ring wind,The streaky clouds, that tinge their darken'd topsWith russet hues, and fainter gleams of light,The solitude that all around becalmsThe peaceful air, conspire to wrap my soulIn musings mild, and nought the solemn sceneAnd the still silence breaks; but distant soundsOf bleating flocks, that to their destin'd foldThe shepherd drives; mean-time the shrill-tun'd bellOf some lone ewe that wander's from the rest,Tinkles far-off, with solitary sound;The lowing cows that wait the milker's hand,The cottage-mastiff's bark, the joyous shoutsOf swains that meet to wrestle on the green, Are heard around. But ah! since ruthless warHas ravag'd in these fields, so tranquil once,Too oft' alas the din of clashing armsAnd discord fell disturbs the softer scene!Thy sweet approach delights the wearied ox,While in loose traces from the furrow'd fieldHe comes; thy dawn the weary reaper loves,Who long had fainted in the mid-day sun,Pleas'd with the cooler hour, along the valeWhistling he home returns to kiss his babes,With joyful heart, his labour's sweet reward!But ah! what sudden fears amaze his soulWhen near approaching, all before he seesHis lowly cottage and the village 'roundSwept into ruin by the hand of war,Dispers'd his children, and his much-lov'd wife,No more to glad his breast with home felt-joys!I too, when in my watled cotes are laidMy supping flock, rejoice to meet my dear,My fair LAURETTA, at the wonted oak;Or haply as her milking-pail she bearsReturning from the field, to ease her arm, (Sweet office!) and impart my aiding hand!Thy charms (O beauteous Evening!) shall be sung,As long as these tall pines shall wave their heads,Or this clear fountain cleave the riven stone!ACIS.Sweet are the dews of Eve; her fragrance sweet;Sweet are the pine-topt hills at sultry noon;Sweet is the shelter of the friendly grottTo sheep, and shepherd, at impending storms;But ah! less sweet the fragrant dews of eve;Less sweet the pine-topt hills at sultry noon;Less sweet the shelter of the friendly grott,Than when the rising sun with rosy beamPeeps o'er the village-top, and o'er the fields,The woods, the hills, the streams, and level meads,Scatters bright splendors and diffusive joy!As to his flock the shepherd issues forth,Printing new footsteps in the dewy vale,Each object of the joyous scene aroundVernal delight inspires, and glads his heartUnknowing of the cause, with new-felt glee!The chaunt of early birds on every bush,The steaming odours of the fresh-blown flow'rs—ALC.Cease, ACIS, cease thy song:—from yonder hill,Whose lofty sides inclose this secret seat,Our flocks, that graze along its verd'rous brow,Tumultuous rush, as struck with sudden fright:And hark, methinks I hear the deathful soundsOf war approaching, and its thunders roar!ACIS.Kind heav'n preserve my wife and children dear,Alas! I fear the sound, that louder nowSwells in the wind, and comes with fuller din,Is near my cottage; which, thou know'st, my friend,Stands at the spring, that issues from beneathThat rising hill, fast by the branching elm!ALC.See, see, my friend, what darksome spires ariseOf wreathing smoak, and blacken all the sky!—Nearer and nearer comes the threat'ning voice,And more distinguish'd strikes our trembling ear!But lo! the foes advance above the hill;I see their glitt'ring arms begin to gleam!Come, let us flie, and in the deepest nook,The inmost cavern of this winding grott,Close-shroud ourselves, lest in the gen'ral streamOf thousands thronging down, we fall opprest.ECLOGUE the THIRD.WHEN sable midnight on the fields and woodsHad spread her mantle dark, then wander'd forthThe pensive ALCON, and the bosom deepOf a wild wood with solitary steps,There to lament his wretched fate, he sought.Him, late as o'er the vale at coming eveJoyful he walk'd with his LUCILLA dear,A soldier stern-advancing on his steed,Robb'd of his love, and tore the beauteous maidWith brutal hand from his contending arms,Weeping in vain, and shrieking for his aid,And frowning bore the precious prize away.The wood, whose shades the plaintive shepherd sought,Was dark and pathless, and by neighb'ring feetLong time untrod: for there in ancient daysTwo knights of bold emprise, and high renown,Met in fierce combat, to dispute the prizeOf beauty bright, whose valiant arm shou'd win A virgin fair, whose far-emblazon'd charmsWith equal love had smote their rival breasts.The knight who fell beneath the victor's sword,Unhears'd and restless, from that fatal dayWanders the hated shades, a spectre pale;And each revolving night, are heard to soundFar from the inmost bow'r of the deep wood,Loud shrieks, and hollow groans, and rattling chains.When the dark secrets of the grove he gain'd,Beneath an ancient oak his weary limbsHe laid adown, and thus to plain began.This midnight deep to plaintive love accords;This lonesone silence, and these hideous shades,That in this darksome hour I dare to tread,And all the horrors of this fearful place,Will suit a wretch abandon'd to despair l—But hah!—what means this sudden fear, that creepsIn chilly sweats o'er all my trembling limbs?—What hollow-whisp'ring sounds are those I hear,From yonder glade?—do not I hear his voice?Does not the knight, that in these shades was slain,Call me to come, and beckon with his hand? Do not I see his visionary swordWav'd in bright circles thro' the murky air?—Does not he point his wounds?—be still, my fears:'Tis vain illusion all, and phantasie.These fears my love-distemper'd brain suggests;Alas, they will not bring me back my love!—Who now, perhaps, amid the thronged campOn earth's cold breast reclines her weary head,A helpless virgin, subject to the willOf each rude ravisher, and distant farFrom her dear ALCON, and her native fields—Ill will the hardships of inclement skiesSuit with her tender limbs; the various toilsOf painful marches; her unwonted ears,How bear the trumpet, and the sounds of war?This task is hard indeed—but soon, alas!At will her savage lord may cast her off,And leave her to succeeding scenes of woe!I see my dear LUCILLA, once my own,Naked and hungry, tread the pensive stepsOf desolation, doom'd to wander o'er,Helpless and vagabond, the friendless earth! I hear her sigh for ALCON and her home;And ask for bread at some proud palace gateWith unavailing voice! This toilsome scene,Alas, how diff'rent from the smoother pathsOf rural life, my dear was wont to tread!Forth to the field to bear the milking-pailWas all her wont; to tread the tedded grass,To tend her father's flock; beneath the oakTo snatch her dinner sweet, and on the greenWith the companions of her age to sport!In vain I now expect the coming onOf dew-bath'd eve, to meet my wonted love;No more I hear the wood-girt vallies ringWith her blythe voice, that oft has blest mine ear,As in the distant shade I sate unseen;No more I meet her at the wonted spring,Where each revolving noon she daily wentTo fill her pitcher with the crystal flood!—If in her native fields the hand of deathHad snatch'd her from my arms, I cou'd have bornThe fatal shock with less-repining heart;For then I could have had one parting kiss; I cou'd have
 her hearse with fairest
flow'rs,And paid the last sad office to my dear!—Return, my sweet LUCILLA, to my arms;At thy return, all nature will rejoice.Together will we walk the verdant vales,And mingle sweet discourse with kisses sweet.Come, I will climb for thee the knotted oak,To rob the stock-dove of his feathery young;I'll shew thee where the softest cowslips spring,And clust'ring nuts their laden branches bend;Together will we taste the dews of morn;Together seek the grotts at sultry noon;Together from the field at eve return—What have I said? what painted scenes of blissMy vain imagination has display'd!Alas, she's gone, ah, never to return!Farewell my past'ral pipe, and my dear flock;Farewell my faithful dog; my once-lov'd hauntsFarewell, or cave, or fountain, or fresh shade,Farewell; and thou, my low-rooft cott, farewell!—Here will I lie, and fellest wolves, that roamThis savage forest, shall devour my limbs,Unwept, unburied, in a place unknown!ECLOGUE the FOURTH.MYCON and PHILANTHES.MYC.WELCOME, Philanthes, to thy native fields;Thrice three revolving moons are gone and past,Since first you parted from your father's cott,To drive to pastures far remote your flock.Since that, alas, how oft has savage warDisturb'd our dwellings, and defac'd our fields!PHIL.MYCON, each object that I view around,Speaks ruin and destruction. See, my friend,The ancient wood, whose venerable shadesSo oft have shelter'd us from noon-day suns;So oft have echo'd to the lowing herdsThat fed wide-wandering in the neighb'ring vales,The soldier's ax has levell'd with the ground,And to the sun expos'd its darksome bow'rs:The distant villages, and blue-topt hills,The far-stretch'd meads appear, and meet mine eyes,That erst were intercepted by the grove.MYC.How is the wonted face of all things chang'd!Those trees, by whose aspiring tops we knewThe sun's ascent at noon, unerring mark,No more are seen to tell the coming hour.How naked does the winding rill appear,Whose banks its pendant umbrage deep-imbrown'd,And far-invested with its arborous roof,As by its side it roll'd its secret streams;How oft, alas! those shadowy banks along(Close solitude!) my ROSALIND and IHave walk'd in converse sweet, and link'd in love!But tell me, dear PHILANTHES, are the fields,Which late you left, like ours by war opprest,Alike in tumult and confusion wrapt?PHI.MYCON, I'll tell thee wonders past belief.It hap'd one morn, when first the dawning sunBegan to chear the light-enliven'd earth,Caught with so bright a scene, I sought the fieldsBefore my wonted hour, and roving wideAmong the vales, the villages and woods,Where'er my fancy led, or pleasure call'd,I chanc'd upon a neighb'ring hill to stray, To view the glitt'ring prospect from its topOf the broad Rhine, that roll'd his waves beneath,Amid the level of extended meads;When
It may be suppos'd that in these lines the
shepherd is giving an account of Prince CHARLES's passing the
Rhine. lo! e'er yet I gain'd its lofty brow,The sound of dashing floods, and dashing arms,And neighing steeds, confusive struck mine ear.Studious to know what tumult was at hand,With step adven'trous I advanc'd, and gain'dWith tim'rous care and cautious ken its top.Sudden a burst of brightness smote my sight,From arms, and all th' imblazonrie of warReflected far, while steeds, and men, and armsSeem'd floating wide, and stretch'd in vast arrayO'er the broad bosom of the big-swoln flood,That dashing roll'd its beamy waves between.The banks promiscuous swarm'd with thronging troops,These on the flood embarking, those appear'dCrowding the adverse shore, already past.All was confusion, all tumultuous din.I trembled as I look'd, tho' far above, And in one blaze their arms were blended brightWith the broad stream, while all the glist'ring sceneThe morn illum'd, and in one splendor clad.Struck at the sight, I left with headlong hasteThe steep-brow'd hill, and o'er th' extended vales,The wood-girt lawns I ran, nor slack'd my pace,Till at my flock thick-panting I arriv'd,And drove far off, beneath a deep-arch'd cave.But come, my friend, inform me in return,Since this my absence what has here fell out.MYC.Dost thou remember at the river's sideThat solitary convent, all behindHid by the convert of a mantling wood?—One night, when all was wrapt in darkness deep,An armed troop on rage and rapine bent,Pour'd o'er the fields and ravag'd all they met;Nor did that sacred pile escape their arms,Whose walls the murderous band to ruin swept,And fill'd its caverns deep with armed throngsGreedy of spoil, and snatch'd their treasures oldFrom their dark seats: the shrieking sisters fledDispers'd and naked thro' the fields and woods, While sable night conceal'd their wand'ring
steps.Part in my moss-grown cottage shelter sought,Which haply scap'd their rage, in secret gladeImmersed deep.—I rose at early morn,With fearful heart to view the ruin'd dome,Where all was desolation, all appear'dThe seat of horror, and devouring war.The deep recesses, and the gloomy nooks,The vaulted isles, and shrines of imag'd saints,The caverns worn by holy knees appear'd,And to the sun were op'd.—In musing thoughtI said, as on the pile I bent my brow—" This seat to future ages will appear," Like that which stands fast by the piny rock;" These silent walls with ivy shall be hung," And distant times shall view the sacred pile," Unknowing how it fell, with pious awe!" The pilgrim here shall visit, and the swain" Returning from the field at twilight grey," Shall shun to pass this way, subdued by fear," And slant his course across the adverse vale!"PHI.MYCON, thou see'st that cow, which stands in coolAmid yon rushy lake, beneath the shadeOf willow green, and ruminates at ease,The watry herbage that around her floats.That way my business leads. I go to greetMy father, and my wonted cottage dear.MYC.Come, let us go: my path is that way too.Come, my PHILANTHES, and may piteous heav'nIndulge more happy days, and calm our griefs!Alas! I thought some trouble was at hand,And long before presag'd the coming storm,Ev'n when the light'ning one disastrous nightBlasted the hoary oak, whose ample boughsImbow'r my cottage; and as on the grassAt noon I slept, a serpent's sudden hissBroke my sweet rest!—But come, let us be gone,The sun begins to welk in ruddy west.ECLOGUE the FIFTH.CORIN and CALISTAN.COR.WHICH way, CALISTAN, whither dost thou leadThat lamb, whom yet his mother scarce has wean'd?CAL.His mother, CORIN, as she wand'ring fed,With this tender youngling by her side,Fell by a shot which from the battle came,That in the neighb'ring fields so lately rag'd.COR.Alas! what woes that fatal day involv'dOur suff'ring village, and the fields around!But come, CALISTAN, on this rising bankCome, let us sit, and on the danger pastConverse secure, and number all our griefs.See how the flaunting woodbine shades the bank,And weaves a mantling canopy above!CAL.CORIN, that day I chanc'd at earlier hourTo rise, and drove far-off my flock unpent;To wash them in a spring that late I mark'd. There the first motions of the deathful dayI heard, as listening to the trickling waveI stood attentive: when like rising storms,Hoarse, hollow murmurs from afar I heard,And undistinguish'd sounds of distant din.Alarm'd I stood, unknowing whence it came;And from the fount my flock unwash'd I droveSuspecting danger: when as nearer yet,I came advancing, all was tumult loud,All was tempestuous din on ev'ry side,And all around the roar of war was up,From rock to rock retost, from wood to wood.Not half so loud the tumbling cataractIs heard to roar, that from the pine-clad cliffPraecipitates its waves; whose distant soundsI oft have listen'd, as at twilight greyI pent my flocks within their watled cotes.COR.For three revolving days, nor voice of birdMelodious chaunting, or the bleat of sheep,Or lowing oxen, near the fatal placeWere heard to sound; but all was silence sad! The ancient grove of elms deserted stood,Where long had dwelt an aged race of rooks,That with their nests had crowded every branch.We oft' have heard them at the dusk of eveIn troops returning to their well-known home,In mingled clamors sounding from on high!CAL.CORIN, thou know'st the fir-invested cave,Where late we shelter'd from a gath'ring storm,Our flocks together driv'n: beneath its shadeI had appointed at sweet even-tideTo meet my DELIA homeward as she pass'd,Bearing her milking-pail: Alas! the thoughtsOf that sweet congress, the preceding nightSoften'd my dreams, and all my senses lull'd,And with more joyful heart at morn I rose.But ah! that tumult cropt my blooming hopes,And in confusion wrapt my love and me.COR.That day, nor in the fold my flock I pent,Or walk'd at eve the vales, or on the turfBeneath the wonted oak my dinner took,Or slept at noon amid my languid sheep, Repos'd at ease on the green meadow's bed.When sable night came on, for not ev'n yetThe tumult had subsided into peace,Ev'n then low sounds, and interrupted burstsOf war we heard, and cries of dying men,And a confus'd hum of the ceasing storm.All night close-shrouded in a forest thick,Wakeful I sate, my flock around me laid;And of neglected boughs I kindled upA scanty flame, whose darkly-gleaming blazeAmong th' enlighten'd trees form'd hideous shapes,And spectres pale, to my distemper'd mind.How oft I look'd behind with cautious fear,And trembled at each motion of the wind!—But where did you, CALISTAN, shelter seek?What dark retreat conceal'd your wand'ring steps?CAL.CORIN, thou know'st the fur-clad hermit's cellDeep-arch'd beneath a rock among the wilds,Thither I bent my flight, a welcome guest,And not unknown; for when my flock I fedOf late beneath the neighb'ring pastures green, I oft was wont, invited at his call,At noon beneath his cavern to retireFrom the sun's heat, where all the passing hoursThe good old-man improv'd with converse high,And in my breast enkindled virtue's love;Nor seldom would his hospitable handAfford a short repast of berries cool,Which o'er the wilds (his scanty food) he pluck'd:Here was my refuge.—All the live-long nightPensive by one, pale, lonesome lamp we sate,And listen'd to the bleak winds whistling loud,And the shrill crash of forests from without.Soon as the morning dawn'd, the craggy heightOf the steep rock I climb'd, on whose wild topHis rustic temple stood, and moss-grown cross(The sacred object of his pious pray'rs)Form'd of a tall fir's thunder-blasted trunk:Where all beneath th' expansive plains I sawWith white pavilions hid, in deep array.There too my little fold, which late I leftStanding at eve, amid the warlike scene With tearful eyes affrighted, I beheld.Alas, how chang'd the scene! when there I pitch'dThose hurdled coes, the night
was calm and mild,And all was peaceful. I remember well,While there within that fold my flock I pent,How blythe I heard my beauteous DELIA sing!Her distant-echoing voice how sweetly rung,And all my ravish'd senses wrapt in bliss!COR.Hast thou not seen the fatal plain of deathWhere rag'd the conflict? there, they say, at eveGrim ghosts are seen of men that there were slain,Pointing their wounds and shrieking to their mates,Still doom'd to haunt the fields on which they fell.CAL.CORIN, no more. This lamb demands my speed.See how the youngling hangs his sickly head,Tender, and fainting for his wonted food!I haste to place him in my shelt'ring cott,Fed from my hand, and cherish'd by my care.—And see, my friend, far off in darken'd westA cloud comes on, and threatens sudden rains.CORIN, farewell, the storm begins to low'r.FINIS.
