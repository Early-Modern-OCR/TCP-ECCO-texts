THE ATHENAID. A POEM.VOL. II.THE ATHENAID, A POEM,BY THE AUTHOR OF LEONIDAS.VOL. II.LONDON: PRINTED FOR T. CADELL, IN THE STRAND. M.DCC.LXXXVII.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the ELEVENTH.TH' unloosen'd anchors to the waves resignThe Delphian keels, while Auster's friendly breath,Their burden light'ning, soon to Sunium shewsThe spreading sails. Two vessels, riding there,Receive embarking warriors. On the beachLooks Medon stedfast: By almighty Jove,He cries aloud, Themistocles I see!O Haliartus, O my holy friend,We must not leave unvisited a shore
Which holds that living trophy to our view,The victor-chief at Salamis. The skiffIs launch'd; they land. Themistocles beginsThe salutation: Hail! Oileus' son,Thou rev'rend host of Athens, Timon, hail!Your unexpected presence here excitesA pleasing wonder. Whither do ye steerThese well remember'd vessels, which convey'dThee, first of Locrians, with our Attic bard,To Salamis from Delphi? In that courseWas Timon captive made, whom freed at lastMy joyful arms embrace. The Locrian here:To Atalanté, in Euboean streights,We steer; another of Oilean race,Through bounteous Heav'n a refuge there obtains,My brother, good Leonteus, with a bandOf gallant Locrians, ready at my callTo lift their bucklers in defence of Greece.
But why, remote from Athens, on the strandOf naked Sunium, do I see the sonOf Neocles, so recently by meAt Sparta left? Themistocles replies:Forbear enquiry now, O virtuous branchOf that ennobled stock, th' Oilean house!If e'er my conduct merited thy praise,If thou believ'st me studious of the fameWhich follows manly deeds, forbear to doubtTh' unwearied further efforts of my limbs,My heart, my talents: Secrecy matures,Time brings the labour of the mind to birth.Were those first steps reveal'd, which restless thought,Constructing some vast enterprize, ascends,How wild a wand'rer, Medon, would appearThe policy of man! But, gen'rous chief,Whose valour, whose experience might assureA prosp'rous issue to a bold exploit,
Say, should I open on some future dayTo thy discerning sight the clearest track,Where to success one glorious stride might reach,Wouldst thou be ready at my call? He paus'd.From such a mouth, such captivating wordsInsinuate sweetness through the Locrian's ear,Who feels th' allurement; yet, by prudence rul'd,This answer frames: Through such a glorious trackWhoever guides, may challenge Medon's aid;Thou prove that guide, my steps shall follow close,Unless by Aristides call'd, whose voiceCommands my service. Cool th' Athenian hidesThe smart his wounded vanity endures,And manly thus, unchang'd in look, rejoins:I ask no more; I rest my future claimOn Medon's valour, only to supportWhat Aristides shall approve, farewell.
Avail thee straight of these propitious winds;In Atalanté, known to me of old,What force thou can'st, assemble; dread no wants,I will be watchful to supply them all.They part. Now Medon, under hoisted sails,Remarks unwonted transport on the cheekOf Haliartus. O my peasant weeds,His joy exclaims, how gratefully you riseIn my remembrance now! From you my hopesForebode some benefit to Greece. Dear lord,Forbear enquiry; by yon hero warn'd,In secrecy my thoughts, till form'd complete,Lie deeply bury'd. Timon smil'd, and spake:I know, full often enterprises boldLie in the womb of mystery conceal'd;Thus far th' Athenian hero and thyselfRaise expectation; but I further know,
His faculties are matchless, thou art brave,Unerring Medon like my god is wise;Thence expectation soars on steady wings.O light of Greece, Themistocles, exertThy boundless pow'rs! mature thy pregnant plan!Whene'er the glorious mystery unveils,Me and my Delphians thou shalt find prepar'd.The turbulent Euripus swift they ploughIn pleasing converse thus, and clasp, in hope,Their anxious friends on Atalanté's shore.When ev'ry mast was hid by Sunium's cape,Thus to his faithful minister, the sonOf Neocles: Sicinus, hast thou seenMy followers on board? The treasures broughtFrom Xerxes, those my spoils of war supply,The arms, the stores, Sicinus, has thy careDeposited in safety? Yes, replies
Th' entrusted servant. Now thyself embark,His lord enjoins, who, musing thus, remains:If my attempt to further I have wonThis gallant Locrian, frankly I confessMy debt to fortune; but this casual boonI can forego, if wantonly her handResumes; Themistocles alone can traceA path to glory. Tow'rds the land he turns,Proceeding thus: Now, Attica, farewell,A while farewell. To thee, Barbarian gold,Themistocles resorts; my bosom guest,Whom Aristides in disdain would spurn,By thee, O gift of Xerxes, I will raiseThe weal of Athens, and a fresh increaseTo my own laurels. Uncontroll'd, supremeIs Aristides. He the Attic youthIn phalanx bright to victory may lead;Minerva's bird Xanthippus may display
To Asia, trembling at their naval flag;A private man, Themistocles will reachYour summits, fellow citizens, preferr'dTo his command. Ye chosen heroes, waitFor breezy spring to wanton in your sails,Then range your vig'rous files, and pamper'd steeds;Themistocles, amid septentrion snows,Shall rouse despair and anguish from their denOf lamentation; poverty shall blazeIn radiant steel; pale misery shall graspA standard. Athens, thy rejected sonExtorted aid from tyranny shall drawOn his own greatness to establish thine.Swift he embarks, like Neptune when he mountsHis rapid conch to call the tempests forth,Upturn the floods, and rule them when they rage.The third clear morning shews Eretria's port,Among Euboean cities once superb,
Eretria now in ashes. She had join'dTh' Athenians, bold invaders, who consum'dThe capital of Lydia, to revengeIonian Greeks enthrall'd. Eretria paidSevere atonement to Hystaspes' son,Incens'd Darius. To a Cissian plain,A central space of his unbounded realm,Far from their ancient seat, which flames devour'd,He her exterminated race confin'd,Sad captives, never to revisit moreTheir native isle. A silent wharf admitsThemistocles on shore, a void extent,Where sons of Neptune heretofore had swarm'd.No mooring vessel in the haven rode,No footstep mark'd the ways; sole inmates there,Calamity and horror, as enthron'd,Sat on o'erwhelming ruins, and forbadeThe hero passage, till a seeming trackPresents, half bury'd in surrounding heaps
Of desolation, what appears a dome,Rais'd to some god. Themistocles observesA shatter'd porch, whose proud supporters lieIn fragments, save one column, which upholdsPart of a sculptur'd pediment, where, blackBy conflagation, an inscription maim'dRetains these words, "To eleutherian Jove."Th' Athenian enters, follow'd by his trainIn arms complete. Excluded was the dayBy ruins pil'd externally around,Unless what broken thinly-scatter'd raysShot through th' encumber'd portal. Soon they standAmidst obscuring dusk in silence all,All motionless in wonder, while a voice,Distinct in tone, delivers through the voidThese solemn accents: Eleutherian god!Since no redeemer to Eretria fall'nThy will vouchsafes, why longer dost thou keep
Thy aged servant on a stage of woe?Why not release him? why not close his eyes,So vainly melting o'er his country lost?Ten years are fled; the morning I have hail'dIn sighs alone; have laid my head on thornsOf anguish, nightly visited in dreamsBy images of horror, which employEach waking moment. To have seen destroy'dFrom their foundations my paternal streets,The holy structures burn, a people forc'dIn climates new and barbarous to dwell,Was sure enough to suffer—It is timeTo give my patience rest. The plaintive soundDraws on th' Athenian, who perceives a gleam,Pale-quiv'ring o'er a solitary lamp;Perceives a rev'rend sire, resembling Time,Down to whose girdle hangs the snowy fleeceOf wintry age. Unaw'd his lamp he rais'd;A dim reflection from the polish'd armsReveal'd the warrior, whom he thus bespake:Whate'er thou art, if hostile, or a friend,A god, a mortal, or a phantom vain,Know, that my state no change can render worse,All change make better. Father, soft repliedTh' advancing chief, take comfort, I am comeThy country's saviour; follow, in the daySee who I am. Between the op'ning bandHe leads the senior through the dusky porch,Whom he accosts before th' unclouded sun,Then vertical: Rest, father, and beholdThemistocles of Athens. While the priest,So by his fillet sacerdotal known,In wonder paus'd, th' artificer divineOf wiles to catch the sudden turns of chance,Frames in a momentary cast of thoughtThis bright device of fiction to allureA holy mind. O worthy of the god!Thou servant pure of Jupiter! I mourn,Like thee, Eretria, not like thee despond.
Attend, thou righteous votary to heav'n!I, from the day of Salamis o'ertoil'd,While courting slumber, in a vision sawThe sapient issue of th' almighty sire,His best belov'd Minerva. Still the soundOf her gorgonian shield my ears retain,While earnest, striking on its rim her spear,The virgin warrior spake: Triumphant sonOf Neocles, remember in thy joyThe miseries of others. Go, redeemEretria fall'n, whose noble remnant arm'dSev'n ships, exhausting all their slender stores,To fight for Athens on this glorious day.As from the sooty gate of direful DisDeliver'd Theseus, when to cheering dayHe reascended, on Alcides look'd,Who for his lov'd companion pierc'd the gloomOf Erebus; th' Eretrian's grateful eyes
Thus on the son of Neocles were fix'd,In ecstacy of joy. These fervent wordsHe utter'd: Heav'n hath giv'n thee to destroyPresumptuous foes, O favour'd by the gods!Who give thee now to save despairing friends;That, all-rejoicing in thy trophies new,Great as thou art, thy gen'rous soul may prove,How far beyond the transports conquest yields,Are those resulting from benignant deeds.More grateful, chief, is charity's sweet voice,Than Fame's shrill trumpet, in the ear of Jove,Who will, on such humanity as thine,Accumulate his blessings. If my nameThou ne'er hast heard, or, hearing, hast forgot,Know, that from lib'ral Cleobulus sprung,I am Tisander. Interrupting swiftTh' Athenian here: Thy own, thy father's name,To me, illustrious pontiff, well are known.My recent banner in the summer's gale
Thou must remember on th' Eretrian coast.Eretrian warriors under Cleon's charge,In ships by me supply'd, undaunted foughtAt Artemisium, and an earnest gaveOf their late prowess. From their chief, from allThy celebrating countrymen, I heardOf thee Tisander, and thy name retain;Proceed. To him the priest: Flow first my tears!Of that brave band whatever now remainsHave nought but prowess left. Alas! how fewEscap'd thy fell, exterminating hand,When treachery surrender'd to thy pow'r,Darius! Sons of husbandry lay hidIn woods and caverns; of the nobler classSome on the main were absent. Priest of JoveI was releas'd; a pious, beardless prince,Nam'd Hyperanthes, on my rank and yearsLook'd with compassion; living, I extol,My dying breath shall bless him. I have dwelt
Within my temple, mourning o'er this waste.Here, annually collected (Lo! the dayOf that severe solemnity is nigh)Th' unhappy reliques of Eretrian bloodAccompany my tears. Thou knowst, they sail'dAt thy appointment, on Athenian decks,They and the men of Styra from that portFor Salamis. In glory they return'dTo want and horror, desert found their land,Their crops, their future sustenance destroy'd,Their huts consum'd, their cattle swept away,Their progeny, their wives; flagitious actOf Demonax, in Oreus late replac'd,Her tyrant foul, a slave to Xerxes' throne,His scourge in rich Euboea, half-reduc'dTo this dire monster's sway, by royal aidOf endless treasure, and Barbarian bands.Such is our state. Too scanty are the meansOf willing Styra to relieve such wants;
Our wealthier neighbours of Carystus vend,Not give; in hoarded grain, in flocks and herdsAbounding, them a sordid chief controlls,Nicomachus. An oligarchy rulesGeraestus small, but opulent—O Jove!I see brave Cleon yonder; from his headHe rends the hair—what gestures of distress!He beats his troubled bosom, wrings his hands!Not heeding great Themistocles, he pointsOn me alone a wild distracted look!Say Cleon. . . Swift, with shiv'ring lips and pale,Th' Eretrian leader, interrupting, ventsHis tortur'd thoughts: Tisander, can thy pray'rsRepel grim famine, rushing on the blastOf barren winter? Three disastrous daysWill lay the combatants for Greece in dust,Behind them leaving nothing but a nameFor Salamis to publish. Lo! they come,A dying people, suppliant to repose
Within thy fane their flesh-divested bones.Yet such a tomb, their fainting voices cry,May those Eretrians envy who are doom'dTo lodge their captive limbs in Asia's mold.He ends in sighs. Behold, a ghastly troopSlow through the ruins of their native streetsIn languid pace advance! So gath'ring shoalsOf ghosts from hour to hour through endless time,The unrelenting eye of Charon views,By sickness, plague and famine, by the sword,Or heart-corroding sorrow, sent from lightTo pass the black irremeable floodsOf Styx. Cecropia's hero cast a lookLike Phoebus heav'nly-gentle, when, aton'd,Th' infectious air he clear'd, awak'ning galesTo breathe salubrious o'er th' enfeebled hostOf Agamemnon, as from death they roseYet to assert their glory. Swift the chief
Bespake Sicinus: Haste, unlaid the ships;Three talents bring; they, Cleon, shall be thine;Seek those in every part who vend, not give.The gifts of Ceres in profusion bear,The gifts of Pan, the grape's reviving juice,To these, my fellow warriors, who have seenMy banner streaming, twice have lent their aidTo my renown; meantime our naval foodShall be their portion; vesture now shall cheerTheir limbs. My brave companions, I have broughtThe spear and buckler for your manly hands;Your strength restor'd shall feel the glorious weightOf crested helms. Tisander, let them restWithin thy shelt'ring temple, not to sinkBeneath distress, but vig'rous soon renewTheir practis'd race of honour. Pass, my friends,Be mute; expression of your joy I wave;Again to-morrow you and I will meet.Tisander, happy, entertains his guests,Twelve hundred countrymen, the last remainsOf populous Eretria. Plenty's boonAlert the Attic mariners diffuseTo all, and cordial tend their wants; discreetSicinus curbs excess. The tidings broughtOf his performance from a short repastDismiss'd his lord applauding; who serene,Stretch'd on his naval pillow, slept till dawn.He rose. To him Sicinus: Will my lordPermit his servant, with an active bandOf sailors, these obstructions to remove,Or so dispose, that feeblest steps may findA passage free to good Tisander's fane;That through its wonted apertures, the roundOf that huge pile, where Jupiter should dwell,Now dark as Pluto's palace, may admitThe light of heav'n? Yet further, we must search
For coverts dry, if such the greedy flamesHave left among these ruins, to secureThe various stores, which Cleon may transport.To him his lord: Go, monitor expert,Accomplish what thou counsel'st. Tow'rds the faneHimself not slow proceeds. Before the front,On scatter'd fragments of their ancient homes,Th' Eretrians, pale with long-continu'd want,Are seated. Thick as winter-famish'd birdsPerch on the boughs, which icicles encrust,Yet chirp and flutter in th' attemp'ring sun,These, at the hero's presence, wave their hands,Unite their efforts in acclaim not loud,But cordial, rather in a gen'ral sighOf gratitude. The charitable careOf his best warriors, some of noblest birth,Impart their help, like parents to a raceOf tender infants. Onc f might approv'd
In battle, hardiest of the naval breed,Th' Eretrians, worn by hunger, scarce retainThe slender pow'rs of childhood. One by oneThemistocles consoles them, and devotesIn condescension sedulous the dayTo kindness not impolitic. In theseHis piercing genius fit materials sawTo build another structure of renown.Ere he retires, Tisander thus he greets:Wilt thou, O father! on my board bestowAn evening hour? My moments all belongTo this yet helpless people, said the priest.Such pious care through me shall heav'n reward,Exclaims the chief, as round him he remarksThe toiling sailors; soon, thou guardian goodOf wretched men committed to thy charge,Soon shall thy temple reassume its state.
Prepare an altar; Hecatombs againShall smoke ere long, Eretria cast asideHer widow'd garb, and lift her festive palmsTo eleutherian Jove. This utter'd, swiftHe seeks his vessel, while the sun descends.Calm, as in summer, through an ether clearAurora leads the day. A cheerful soundOf Oxen, lowing from the hollow dalesWhich tow'rds Carystus wind, of bleeting sheep,Yet nearer driven across the Eretrian plain,Awake Themistocles. His couch he leaves,Revisiting the temple; there enjoysThe gen'ral transport. Plenty on the wingIs nigh, the comforts of her fruitful hornTo pour on desolation. Cleon comes,Accosting thus Themistocles: My taskIs well accomplish'd through the lib'ral zealOf Hyacinthus near a youth unlike
His sire Nicomachus. That subtile chiefOf our Carystian neighbours is behind,Escorting laden carriages of grain,Thy purchase; nought his sordid hand bestows.He, curious more than friendly in our need,Or of thy name respectful, to explore,Not help or pity, hither bends his course.Conduct the father to my ship, reply'dThemistocles; sure yonder is the son,Thou hast describ'd; ingenuous are his looks.Like him, whose name he bears, his beauteous formMight charm the beaming god once more to courtA mortal's friendship; but, dejection paleO'ercasts his hue; strange melancholy dimsHis youthful eye; too modest, or unmann'dBy languor, child of grief, he stops and bowsIn distant, seeming awe, which wounds my soul.I must salute him: Noble youth, receive
My hand; Themistocles of Greece expectsNo such obeisance from a fellow Greek.The majesty of Athens might exactThat conquer'd tyrants, in my presence brought,Low as the dust should crouch beneath her chief.A start of anguish Hyacinthus gaveAt these last words, then silent bow'd againHis decent brow; not awe, but latent illsSeem'd to control his tongue. Th' observant chiefDefers enquiry to its season due,To Cleon's charge consigns him, and retiresTo his own galley. Waiting for the sire,He meditates a moment on the son:I see advantage in this youth's distress—My plan is form'd. He hastens to unbarHis copious treasure; thence in dazzling showHe spreads four silver talents on his board,
O'er them a mantle throws, and brief againThus ruminates: Now, Plutus, who canst sapThe strong-bas'd tow'r, and soften rigid hearts,Smile on this juncture. Aristides scornsThy deity, Themistocles invokesThy precious succour. From profoundest woeDisconsolate Eretria thou hast rais'd;Now by a sordid instrument give lifeTo dull Carystus. Sudden in his view,By Cleon brought, who instantly withdraws,Nicomachus appears, and thus begins:The Salaminian victor I salute,Charg'd by Carystus; happy is my lotTo venerate the chief, and touch the handWhich humbled Asia. Doth Euboea seeThee visitant illustrious to rebuildEretria? then instruct her to confineThat pow'r and pride, her neighbours felt of old.Th' Athenian here: Euboea sees me comeBoth to upraise, Carystian, and depress;But to exalt thy state, my friend, I wish,Wish thy possessions equal to thy worth.Behold! Uplifting to the greedy eyeOf avarice the mantle, he pursues;Behold, four silver talents! Them accept,Which in this casket to thy trusted slavesI will deliver now; I only askOf thy deep-founded influence to warmSupine Carystus: For thyself and GreeceUnite with mine thy standard. Further note,If at my summons thou produce in armsThy citizens auxiliar, from this handExpect four added talents; but the hopesOf no unpractis'd leader, who perceivesHis enterprize assur'd, dare promise more,A share, Nicomachus, of spoil in war,
To pass thy own belief. By present gain,By more in promise, not by glory fir'd,Nicomachus rejoins: A thousand spearsShall wait thy earliest notice. While he spake,He snatch'd the casket, shut the treasure close,Then rush'd to seek his confidential slave,Who takes the precious charge. With placid looksThe cool the politic Athenian satLike some experienc'd pilot, who serene,In skilful guidance of the steady helm,Enjoys the favour smooth of gale and tide,Combin'd to waft o'er ocean's fickle breastHis gliding keel, and lodge her costly freightSecure at length in harbour. Now he spakeTo his re-ent'ring guest: Carystian friend,Thou hast a son, well-disciplin'd to war,Brave, lib'ral, wise, I doubt not; wilt thou trustTo my society a while his youth?He is the object of my vows to heav'n,Nicomachus exclaims, in passion feign'd,
My soul's delight, the rapture of my eye!If he were absent, ev'ry hour my ageWould feel a growing burden. Come, rejoinsTh' Athenian, him I only would detainMy messenger of order to thy walls;On him another talent would bestow.The gymnic school and letters, cries the sire,He follows, heeds not treasure; by his handSend me the talent; never let him knowThe charge he bears. This said, he loudly callsTo Hyacinthus, who had gain'd the deck,Him ent'ring thus addresses: Son, the chiefOf Athens, great Themistocles, demandsThee for companion. As a casual gleamBreaks through th' unrav'lling texture of black clouds,Which long on winter's sullen face have hung;So darts a ray of gladness through the gloomOf Hyacinthus, by the Attic chief
Not unobserv'd. Intent on swift return,Th' exulting father bids to both farewel.Remaining day Themistocles employsAmong his sailors in th' Eretrian streets,Inspects the necessary toil pursu'dWith unremitted vigour, then retiresTo due refection. Cleon is a guestWith Hyacinthus, still by grief devour'dWhich all his efforts strive in vain to hide.Her heavy wing no sooner night outspreads,Than to Sicinus they are giv'n in charge,While to his couch Themistocles repairs.End of the Eleventh Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the TWELFTH.NOW in the zodiac had the sun o'erpass'dThe tenth fair sign. The new succeeding month,Though not by Flora, nor Vertumnus deck'd,Nor green in hue, though first of winter's train,Oft with unsully'd skies irradiate cheersThe prone creation, and delights mankind.The birds yet warble on the leafless sprays,The placid surface, glaz'd by clearest light,In crystal rivers, and transparent lakes,
Or ocean's smooth cerulean bosom, shewsThe finny tribes in play. The active sonOf Neocles uprises, and descriesA dawn which promis'd purity of air,Of light and calmness, tempting sloth herselfTo action. Thus he rous'd his native fire:Of this kind season not a moment lose,Themistocles. Sicinus ever nighHe call'd: Provide two receptacles sure,Each to contain twelve talents; bring my arms,Produce a second suit, resembling mine;Send Hyacinthus; let my chosen bandOf Attic friends, and Sparta's fifty youths,My followers, be ready for a march.Soon Hyacinthus enters; still he shewsThe perturbation of a mind oppress'dBy some conceal'd misfortune, while, beneath
The shade of sorrow, on his front appear'dExcelling graces. Him the chief bespake,Gay in his look, and sprightly in his tone:Her eastern hill, behold, the morning mountsIn radiance, scatter'd from the liquid gemsOn her loose mantle; but the heart of youthIn ev'ry season should rejoice, in cloudsNot less than sunshine, whether nature's voiceBe hoarse in storms, or tune to whisp'ring galesHer vernal music. Sharp some inward grief,When youth is sad; yet fortune oft deceivesThe inexperienc'd by imagin'd ills,Or light, which counsel of the more matureCan lightly heal. Unlock thy lib'ral mind;To me, a guardian pregnant of reliefBeyond thy father, countrymen, or friends,Impart thy cares. The sighing guest replied:To thy controul my service I devote,O scourge of tyrants, but retain my grief!Which thou, O first of mortals, or the kingOf high Olympus, never can redress.Sicinus interrupts; his lord's commandsAre all accomplish'd. Now, Carystian friend,Resembling me in stature, size and limbs,The son of Neocles proceeds, acceptThat suit of armour; I have tried it well;Receive a shield familiar to my arm.He next instructs Sicinus: Thou receiveTwelve talents; hasten to the neighb'ring wallsOf stately Chalcis, populous and rich,Queen of Euboean cities, in whose portThe twenty ships of Athens yet remain,Which Chalcis borrow'd, and equipp'd for war.Of her bold race four thousand we beheld
Distinguish'd late in Artemisium's fight,At Salamis yet later. First approachThe new-made archon in a rev'rent style,Timoxenus most potent in that state,A dubious, timid magistrate, unlikeNearchus. Cordial salutation bearTo him, my brave associate; do not turnThy back on Chalcis, till thy prudence bringsIntelligence of weight; th' Athenian keelsWith grain abundant and materials lade,That friendly roofs th' Eretrians may obtain,Before grim winter harrow up these streightsUnnavigable soon. This said, he arms;Begirt by warriors, to the temple speeds,And greets the priest: In gladsome thought I seeThe goddess Health, white-handed, crimson-cheek'd,As from a silver car in roseate udsLook on thy people; dropping on their lipsRestoring dew, she bids them taste and live.
The convalescent piously employIn labours, where my naval band shall join,To free th' encumber'd temple, to repair,To cover dwellings, lest the winter bringNew hardships. Martial exercise I leaveTo Cleon's care, while ten revolving sunsOf absence I must count. Now, father, takeThis hand, a hand which fortune and thy godHave ever favour'd, which shall soon convertThe annual day of mourning in thy faneTo festival solemnity of joy.Bless'd by Tisander, rapid he departs.Young Hyacinthus follows, who in arms,Once by his patron worn, to ev'ry eyePresents a new Themistocles, but such,As when th' allurement of his early bloomHe, not unconscious of the charm, display'dTo Attic damsels. Cloudless on their march
Apollo shoots a clear and tepid ray;A scatter'd village in Carystian boundsTo rural hospitality admitsThe wearied warriors. Hyacinthus guidesHis great protector to a shelt'ring faneOf Juno, styl'd connubial; stately roundOld beech extend a venerable shade;Through ages time had witness'd to their growth,Whose ruddy texture, disarray'd of green,Glows in the purple of declining day.They pass the marble threshold, when the youthWith visage pale, in accents broken spake:Unequall'd man, behold the only placeFor thy reception fit; for mine. . . He paus'd;A gushing torrent of impetuous griefO'erwhelm'd his cheeks; now starting, on he rush'd,Before the sacred image wrung his hands;
Then sinking down, along the pavement roll'dHis body; in distraction would have dash'dHis forehead there. Themistocles prevents,Uplifts, and binds him in a strong embrace;When thus in eager agony the youth:Is not thy purpose, godlike man, to crushThe tyrant Demonax, in torture cutThe murd'rer short, that he may feel the pangsOf death unnatural? Young man, repliesTh' Athenian grave, to know my hidden thoughts,Dost thou aspire, retaining still thy own?Still in my presence thy distemper drinksThe cup of misery conceal'd, and seems,Rejecting friendship's salutary hand,To court the draught which poisons. Canst thou hope,Mysterious youth, my confidence, yet noneWilt in Themistocles repose? His look,
His tone, in feign'd austerity he wrapp'd,So Aesculapius bitter juice apply'dFrom helpful plants, his wisdom had explor'd,The vehicles of health. In humble tears,Which melted more than flow'd, the mourner thus:Forgive me, too regardless of thy grace;Of all forgetful, save itself, my griefDeserves thy frown, yet less than giddy joy,Which, grown familiar, wantons in the smileOf condescension. Ah! that grief will changeReproof to more than pity; will exciteA thirst for vengeance, when thy justice hearsA tale—Unfold it, interpos'd the chief,To one who knows the various ways of men,Hath study'd long their passions and their woes,Nor less the med'cines for a wounded mind.Then Hyacinthus: Mighty chief, recalThy first successes, when Euboea's maids
Saw from her shores Barbarian pendants low'r'dTo thine, and grateful pluck'd the flow'rs of MayTo dress in chaplets thy victorious deck.Then, at thy gen'rous instigation fir'd,The men of Oreus from their walls expell'dCurst Demonax, their tyrant. On a day,Ah! source of short delight, of lasting pain!I from the labour of a tedious chace,O'erspent by thirst and heat, a forest gain'd.A rill, meandring to a green recess,I track'd; my wonder saw a damsel thereIn sumptuous vesture, couch'd on fragrant tuftsOf camomile, amid surrounding flow'rsReposing. Tall, erect a figure sternWas nigh; all sable on his head and brow,Above his lip, and shadowing his cheeksThe hair was brisled; fierce, but frank his eyeA grim fidelity reveal'd; his belt
Sustain'd a sabre; from a quiver fullOn sight of me an arrow keen he drew,A well-strung bow presented, my approachForbidding loudly. She, upstarting, wak'd.My aspect, surely gentle when I firstBeheld Cleora, more of hope than fearInspir'd; she crav'd protection—What, ye fates!Was my protection—O superior man,Can thy sublimity of soul endureMy tedious anguish! Interposing mildTh' Athenian here: Take time, give sorrow vent,My Hyacinthus, I forbid not tears.He now pursues: her suppliant hands she rais'd,To me astonish'd, hearing from her lips,That Demonax was author of her days.Amid the tumult his expulsion caus'd,She, from a rural palace, where he stor'dWell known to her a treasure, with a slave
In faith approv'd, with gold and gems of priceEscap'd. All night on fleetest steeds they rode,Nor knew what hospitable roof to seek.My father's sister, Glaucé, close behindThis fane of Juno dwelt, her priestess pure,My kindest parent. To her roof I brought—O Glaucé what—O dearest, most rever'd!To thee I brougnt Cleora! Horror paleNow blanch'd his visage, shook his loos'ning joints,Congeal'd his tongue, and rais'd his rigid hair.Th' Athenian calm and silent waits to hearThe reassum'd narration. O ye flow'rs,How were ye fragrant! forth in transport wildBursts Hyacinthus: O embow'ring woods,How soft your shade's refreshment! Founts and rillsHow sweet your cadence, while I won the handOf my Cleora to the nuptial tie,By spotless vows before thy image bound,
O Goddess hymeneal! O what hoursOf happiness untainted, dear espous'd,Did we possess! kind Glaucé smil'd on both.The earliest birds of morning to her voiceOf benediction sung; the gracious foundOur evening heard; content our pillow smooth'd.Ev'n Oxus, so Cleora's slave was nam'd,Of Sacian birth, with grim delight and zealAnticipates our will. My nuptials knownBrings down my father, whose resentment warmTh' affinity with Demonax reproves,A helpless vagabond, a hopeless wretch;For now thy sword at Salamis prevail'd.This storm Cleora calm'd; the gen'rous fairBefore my father laid her dazzling gems;She gave, he took them all; return'd content;Left us too happy in exhaustless storesOf love for envious fate to leave unspoil'd.Meantime no rumour pierc'd our tranquil bow'r,That Demonax in Oreus was replac'd;That he two golden talents to the hand,Which should restore Cleora, had proclaim'd,To me was all unknown. Two moons completeHave spent their periods since one evening lateNicomachus my presence swift requir'd,A dying mother to embrace. By mornI gain'd Carystus; by the close of dayA tender parent on my breast expir'd.An agitation unexpected shookMy father's bosom as I took farewell.On my return—I can no more—Yes, yes,Dwell on each hideous circumstance, my tongue;With horror tear my heartstrings till they burst:Poor Hyacinthus hath no cure but death.The sun was broad at noon; my recent lossLamenting, yet asswaging by the joy
To see Cleora soon, ne'er left before,(A tedious interval to me) I reach'dMy home, th' abode of Glaucé. Clos'd, the doorForbids my passage; to repeated callsNo voice replies; two villagers pass by,Who at my clamours help to force my way.I pass one chamber; strangled on the floor,Two damsel-ministers of Juno lie.I hurry on; a second, where my wifeWas in my absence to partake the couchOf Glaucé, shews that righteous woman dead.The dear impression where Cleora's limbsSleep had embrac'd, I saw, the only traceOf her, the last, these eyes shall e'er behold.Her name my accents strong in frenzy sound:Cleora makes no answer. Next I flyFrom place to place; on Sacian Oxus call:He is not there. A lethargy benumbsMy languid members. In a neighb'ring hut,
Lodg'd by the careful peasants, I awake,Insensible to knowledge of my state.The direful tidings from Carystus rouseMy friends; Nicanor to my father's homeTransports me. Ling'ring, torpid I consum'dSev'n moons successive; when too vig'rous youthRecall'd my strength and memory to curseHealth, sense, and thought. My rashness would have soughtCleora ev'n in Oreus, there have fac'dThe homicide her sire; forbid, with-held,Nicanor I deputed. When I march'dTo bid thee welcome, on the way I metThat friend return'd—Persist, my falt'ring tongue,Rehearse his tidings; pitying Heav'n may closeThy narrative in death—The Sacian slaveProduc'd Cleora to her savage sire;So fame reports, all Oreus so believes.But this is trivial to the tragic scene
Which all beheld. Her hand the tyrant doom'dTo Mindarus, a Persian lord, the chiefOf his auxiliar guard; but she refus'd,And own'd our union, which her pregnant fruitOf love too well confirm'd. The monster, blindWith mad'ning fury, instantly decreedThat deadliest poison through those beauteous lipsShould choak the springs of life. My weeping friendSaw her pale reliques on the fun'ral pyre.I am not mad—ev'n that relief the godsDeny me. All my story I have told,Been accurate on horror to provokeThe stroke of death, yet live. . . Thou must, exclaimsThe chief, humanely artful, thou must live;Without thy help I never can avengeOn Demonax thy wrongs. Ha! cries the youth,Art thou resolv'd to lift thy potent armAgainst the murd'rer? Yes, th' Athenian said,I will do more, thy virtue will uphold,
Whose perseverance through such floods of woeCould wade to bid me welcome. Gen'rous youth,Trust to the man whom myriads ne'er withstood,Who towns from ruin can to greatness raise,Can humble fortune, force her fickle handTo render up the victim she hath mark'dFor shame and sorrow, force her to entwineWith her own finger a triumphant wreathTo deck his brow. Themistocles, who drivesDespair and desolation from the streetsOf fall'n Eretria, and from eastern bondsAfflicted Greece at Salamis preserv'd;He will thy genius to his native pow'rsRestore; will make thee master of revengeFor thy own wrongs; to glorious action guideThy manly steps, redressing, as they tread,The wrongs of others. Not the gracious voiceOf Juno, speaking comfort from her shrine,Not from his tripod Jove's prophetic seed,
Imparting counsel through his Pythian maid,Not Jove himself, from Dodonaean groves,By oracles of promise could have sooth'dThis young, but most distinguish'd of mankindAmong the wretched, as the well-wrought strainOf thy heart-searching policy, expertThemistocles, like some well-practis'd sonOf learn'd Machaon, o'er a patient's woundCompassionate, but cool, who ne'er permitsHis own sensation to control his art.But, said th' Athenian, soldiers must refresh,As well as fast, nor keep incessant watch.They quit the temple. In the dwelling nighDeep-musing Hyacinthus lightly tastesThe light repast. On matted tufts they stretchTheir weary'd limbs. Themistocles had arm'dWith elevated thoughts his pupil's mind,
Which foils at intervals despair. His eyesThe transient palm of sleep would often seal,But oft in dreams his dear espous'd he sees,A livid spectre; an empoison'd cupShe holds, and weeps—then vanishes. Revenge,In bloody sandals and a dusky pall,Succeeds. Her stature growing, as he gaz'd,Reveals a glory, beaming round her head;A sword she brandishes, the awful swordWhich Nemesis unsheathes on crimes. He seesConnubial Juno's image from the baseDescend, and, pointing with its marble hand,Before him glide. A sudden shout of war,The yell of death, Carystian banners wav'd,An apparition of himself in arms,Stir ev'ry sense. The dreadful tumult ends;The headless trunk of Demonax in goreHe views in transport. Instantly his couchShoots forth in laurels, vaulting o'er his head;
The walls are hung with trophies. Juno comes,No longer marble, but the queen of heav'n,Clad in resplendency divine. She leadsCleora, now to perfect bloom restor'd,Who, beck'ning, opens to th' enraptur'd eyeOf Hyacinthus, doating on the charm,Her breast of snow; whence pure ambrosial milkAllures an infant from an amber cloud,Who stoops, and round her neck maternal clings.He to embrace them striving, wak'd and lostTh' endearing picture of illusive air,But wak'd compos'd. His mantle he assum'd,To Juno's statue trod, and thus unlock'dHis pious breast: O goddess! though thy smile,Which I acknowledge for the hours of blissI once possess'd, a brief, exhausted term,Could not protect me from malignant fate,Lo! prostrate fall'n before thee, I complainNo more. My soul shall struggle with despair;
Nor shall the furies drag me to the grave.Thou punishment dost threaten to the crime,Which hath defac'd my happiness on earth;Themistocles, my patron, is thy boon,Who will fulfil thy menace. I believe,There is a place hereafter to admitSuch purity as hers, whose blissful handThou didst bestow—I lost—I know my daysWith all their evils of duration short;I am not conscious of a black misdeed,Which should exclude me from the seat of rest,And therefore wait in pious hope, that soonShall Hyacinthus find his wife and childWith them to dwell forever. He concludes,Regains the chamber, and Aurora shines.End of the Twelfth Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the THIRTEENTH.WHEN Hyacinthus first his couch forsookThemistocles in care had follow'd close,But secretly had noted well the pray'rTo Juno sent, and part approving, partCondemning, heard. Accoutr'd now in mail,The young Carystian, to his list'ning friend,Relates the wonders of his recent dream.Th' Athenian, while most cordial in the careOf Hyacinthus, whom his woes endear'd,
Still weigh'd his use. This answer he devis'dTo ease the grief he pitied, and preserveThe worth essential to his own designs.What thou hast told, Carystian, fires my breast;It was a signal, by Saturnia heldTo animate thy rage, and prompt thy armTo action. She requires not, goddess wise,Humiliation, scorns the sluggish mind,Whose thoughts are creeping to Elysian rest.They hush no throbs of anguish, while it rendsThe mangled heartstrings, no not more than staunchA bleeding wound, or quench a fever's flame.We earn Elysium, and our evils hereSurmount, alike by action. Manly toilRepels despair. Endurance of a storm,Which rocks the vessel, marches long and swift,A river pass'd, while enemies in frontBy whirls of javelins chase the rapid ford,
A rampart scal'd, the forcing of a camp,Are cures of sorrow. In her vision clearSo did heav'n's empress intimate this morn.Me too she visited in sleep; her voiceMy waking thoughts confirm'd; Cleora lives;Else why the goddess thus: Arise, O sonOf Neocles, of this afflicted youthBe thou sure guide to rescue his espous'd;The profanation of my rites chastise.The fiction wraps in credulous delightThe young Carystian's confidence, who feelsCircaean magic from his patron's eye,His tongue, and gesture. He, quick-sighted, turnsTo swift advantage his delusion thus:Come, let me try thy vigour; I am boundTo neighb'ring Styra; fly before thy friend;Among that gen'rous people, who, their all,
Two gallies sent to Salamis, proclaimThemistocles approaches. Like a dart,Lanc'd from the sinews of a Parthian's arm,Without reply th' inspir'd Carystian flew,Cas'd as he was in steel. Meantime the chiefSalutes his Attic and Laconian bands;His captivating presence both enjoy,Which else no eye most piercing might discern,Not ev'n the hundred never-sleeping lights,Which on the margin of her parent floodIncessant watch'd the progeny transform'dOf Inachus, the Argive watry god;Where undistinguish'd in the grazing herdHis daughter wept, nor he that daughter knewA speechless suppliant. Recommenc'd, the marchExhausts the day. Beneath a holy roof,Which rose to Ceres, they their shelter'd limbsTo rest and food resign. There gently swell'dTh' encircling ground, whence fair the morning smil'd
On little Styra, who, no queen superbOf wide dominion, like a rural nymphIn decency of garb, and native locks,Her humble circuit not unlovely shews.She from Athenian boundaries of oldHer first inhabitants deriv'd, and poursHer sons now forth Themistocles to greet,Their eldest parent's hero. Lampon boldAccosts him: Me the weak, but willing handOf Styra late enabled to enrolMy name with thine, unconquerable sonOf Neocles. Though feeble is her sword,Her sinews boast of Attic vigour still.Oh! that her means were equal to her love,A lib'ral welcome thou and these should find;But yon Geraestian oligarchy, foeTo equity and freedom, from our meadsHave newly swept our plenty. Ardent here,Themistocles: By heav'n, my Styrian host,
Not thrice shall day illuminate your skies,Ere double measure shall these petty lordsRepay to Styra. I am come to crushTheir usurpation, in Geraestus fixHer ancient laws, and rouse her martial raceAgainst the Persian, and the Persian's friends.Array thy force. Tomorrow's early sunShall see us march, and ere his second noonThe bird of Athens shall her talons liftAgainst the walls of these presumptuous thieves.They have no walls, Eudemus takes the word,A righteous, brave Geraestian, exil'd late,By hospitable Styra late receiv'd.A forest thick surrounds them, which affordsOne scanty passage; but the ax and bill,Apply'd with vigour, soon will open ways.Sev'n hundred natives can Geraestus arm,Who will not fight to rivet on their necks
A galling yoke more fast. The whole defence,Our oligarchal tyrants have to boast,Are poor Barbarians, scarce three hundred strong,Sav'd from the wrecks of those advent'rous ships,Which round Euboea's rude Capharean capeHad been detach'd thy navy to surroundIn Artemisium's conflict. Now apartThemistocles to Hyacinthus spake,While in his care he lodg'd a casket seal'd,Which held the talent promis'd to his sire:This for thy father; tell him, I requireThe stipulated bands' immediate march;I wish to see them under thy command.Thou know'st Diana's celebrated faneAt Amarynthus; if thou canst, young friend,Be there before me. Pleas'd, the youth departs.As in excursion from their waxen homesA hive's industrious populace obey
The tinkling sound, which summons all to swarm;So, when the trumpet's well-known voice proclaimsTo arms, the Styrians, round the banner'd staff,Which Lampon rais'd, are gather'd. There enjoin'dTo reassemble at a stated hour,Their clinking armour in their homes they cleanse;They whet their spears and falchions to chastiseGeraestian rapine. Ere the morning breaks,Four hundred join Themistocles. He bendsTo Amarynthus, seat of Dian pure,His rapid course. Her edifice sublime,Which overtops her consecrated bow'r,The second noon discovers. Just arriv'd,Carystian helmets round the temple shine,By Hyacinthus and Nicanor led,Joint captains. Staid Nicanor was the friendReturn'd from Oreus, who the tidings broughtOf poor Cleora's fate. Th' Athenian hailsThe young commander: Gladly do I find
Thy speed surpassing mine; but swift explain,Who is the priestess in this pure abode?Then Hyacinthus: She, Eudora nam'd,For sanctity of manners, rank and birth,Through this well-people'd island is renown'd;Authority her hand-maid. Her rich faneWith sumptuous off'rings shines; the wealthiest townsHer intercession at the thrones of heav'nObsequious court, and dread her brow severe.Of elevated stature, awful port,She from Briareus, worshipp'd in our walls,Proud origin derives. She twangs the bow,The javelin lances through the tusky boar,Chac'd o'er the temple's wide domain of wood;Tall nymphs attend her, while the eyes abash'dOf her own vassals shun her stately step.Ah! couldst thou win her favour!. . . Haste, replies
The ready chief, to great Eudora say,Themistocles of Athens humbly suesTo kiss the border of her hallow'd stole.He calls; the martial harness from his limbsAttentive slaves unclasp; ablution pureFrom limpid streams effaces ev'ry stainOf his laborious march; a chlamys flowsLoose from his shoulders. Casting from his browThe plumed casque, uncover'd he ascendsThe massy steps of that stupendous fane.In admiration of the glories there,Through cedar valves, on argent hinges pois'd,He passes, where his own distinguish'd formNo ornament excells. In gold the shapesOf wreaths and garlands, crescents, stars, and suns,Hung round the columns; on the pavement broad,Engraven tripods, vases, statues, bustsOf burnish'd brass and silver were dispos'd,
In graceful order. Pictures, where the lipsSeem speaking, limbs to act, and looks expressThe various passions, which in varying huesExalt the human aspect, or degrade,Enrich the walls. Orion writhes his bulk,Transfix'd by arrows from th' insulted queenOf chastity. Devour'd by rav'nous hounds,His own, Actaeon's metamorphos'd headReclines in blood his newly-branching horns.Unbid by Oeneus to th' Aetolian feast,There on her vengeful Calydonian boarLooks Phoebe down, while red her crescent dartsA flame of anger through disparting clouds.Compell'd to lave her violated limbs,Disrob'd Calisto on the fountain's brinkThere weeps in vain her virgin vow profan'd.Here deeds of Mercy smile. Appeas'd, the queenFolds in the mantle of a silver mistPale Iphigenia, from the holy knife
At Aulis wafts, and substitutes the doeA full-atoning victim. Here she quitsHer Tauric dome, unhospitably stain'dWith blood of strangers. O'er th' entrusted keel,Of sad Orestes, who her image bears,To chace the Furies from his haunted couch,A guardian bland she hovers. Through its lengthMagnificent the midmost isle conveysThe terminating sight, where deep and wideA luminous recess, half-circling, shewsPilasters chisell'd, and a sumptuous freeze.An elevated pavement, yet belowThe sight, whose level skims a surface broadOf marble green, sustains the goddess formIn Parian whiteness, emblem of her state,In height five cubits. Purity severeO'ershades her beauty. Elegantly group'dWithout confusion, dryads, oreads round,With nymphs of lakes and fountains fill the space.Lo! not unlike the deity she serves,Eudora stands before her, and accostsTh' advancing hero thus: I trust, thy soulSome great, some righteous enterprize conceivesElse nothing less might justify the dinOf arms around me, and these banners proudFix'd in my presence on religious groundInviolably sacred. I would know,Themistocles, thy purpose. He one kneeObsequious bends; his lips approach the hemOf her pontific robe, nor she forbids.He then replied: I should not have besoughtThy condescension, priestess, had my soulLess than a righteous enterprize conceiv'd,Deserving sanction from thy holy, pure,All-influencing wisdom; to thy feetI bring my standard, and my sword devoteSpontaneous to thy service. While I cast
My wond'ring eyes on this enrich'd abode,On thee, its chief embellishment, and knowThat impious neighbours in Geraestus rule,Foul pillagers and miscreants, horror thrillsThy soldier's bosom; from a town oppress'dThem to extirpate his vindictive armThemistocles exalts. Eudora look'dApplauding: Go, and prosper, she rejoin'd;Of this attentive piety, O chief,Whom glory crowns, thou never shalt repent!Dismiss'd, he rested; under twilight greyRenew'd his course. Meridian Phoebus view'dCompact battalions from their shields and helmsShoot flames of terror on Geraestian woods.A guard was station'd, where the narrow pathGave entrance; thither Hyacinthus ledA chosen troop, and fierce in accent spake:Train'd to an oar, vile remnants of a wreck,Drop, ye Barbarian vagabonds, those armsFrom your ignoble, mercenary hands;Th' invincible Themistocles requiresImmediate passage. Dubious paus'd their chief,A low Pamphylian rower. In contemptFrom his inverted spear a pond'rous blowThe youth discharg'd, removing all suspence.Prone fell the ruffian, like the victim beast,Stunn'd by a brawny sacrificer's blow,Before an altar's fire. His troop disperse.The Styrians active, by the prudent sonOf Neocles instructed, beat the wood,Wielding the bill and ax in wary dreadOf ambush. No resistance checks the march;The speeding legion penetrates the shades;Thence rushing dreadful on Geraestus spreadsA blaze of steel. So fiery sparks, conceal'dLong in some ancient mansion's girding beam,
There gath'ring force unseen, a passage breakFor conflagration to devour a town.Eudemus joins Themistocles, and thus:Behold, our miscreant oligarchy restOn supplication, now their sole defence;The injur'd people follow; hear the cryOf imprecation. Sev'n flagitious men,By rapine, lust, and homicide deform'd,Those olive boughs profaning by their touch,Come to pollute thy presence. They approach,To whom th' Athenian, stern in visage, spake:Ye little tyrants, who in crimes aspireTo emulate the greatest, do ye comeTo render up your persons? else expectThat populace to seize you, and a pileOf stones to crush your execrable heads.He turns away. The fife and trumpet sound;The sev'n surrender mute; Eudemus gladSecures them, giv'n to Styra's band in charge.Reviv'd Geraestus to her public place,Which heretofore the people wont to fillIn free assembly, as her guardian godReceives the Attic hero. All the wayHe passes, curses on the tyrants heap'dHe list'ning hears, from children for their sires,From wives for husbands, mothers for their sons,The various victims of unlawful pow'r.Dishonour'd damsels, early robb'd of fame,An orphan train, of heritage despoil'd,Indignant husbands, of their wives depriv'd,Their joint upbraidings sound. By all the gods,Th' Athenian bitterly sarcastic spake,Black spirits, your fertility in viceDeserves my wonder; in this narrow spot
You are distinguish'd in the sight of heav'nBy multifarious crimes above the king,Who hath all Asia for his ample range.Be not offended, my Geraestian friends;Ere I restore your franchise I will tryIf chains and dungeons can allay these flamesOf unexampled wickedness. Thou hear'st,Eudemus. Now, Geraestians, you are free.Elect Eudemus archon; of the wealth,Those wretches gather'd, part to public use,To suff'rers part distribute. I demandBut this requital; you have felt the woesOf tyranny; obtaining from my handRedress, that hand enable to preserveThe liberty of others; Greece demandsFrom you that succour, which this happy dayShe hath by me imparted. He withdrawsFrom acclamations and assenting heartsTo give Eudemus counsel. Night is spent.
He swiftly back to Amarynthus flies;Each tyrant follows; from his dungeon drawn,The sun, spectator of his chains and shame,He dreads; in horror, conscious of his guilt,He shrinks at day like Cerberus, when dragg'dBy Hercules from hell. Th' accepted chief,His captives ranging in Eudora's sight,Unfolds their dire variety of crimes,Left to her sentence; awful she decides:He, who oppresses, who enslaves mankind,Himself should feel enthralment, shame and stripes.Let these to some fell traficker in slavesBe sold, transported in remotest climesTo witness Greek severity on vice;So by my voice should Xerxes be condemn'd;So shall the monster Demonax. The meansI find, Themistocles, in thee. ElateTo hear this great, authoritative dame,
The chief replies: Thy mandate is my law,Thy equity is mine. Her stately browUnbending, she concisely questions thus:How shall Eudora's favour mark thy worth?Thy blessing grant, he answers, well appris'd,That asking little best attains to all.I may do more, she said; thy ripen'd thoughtsImpart hereafter; my extent of aidDiana must determine. Now farewell.He press'd no further, tow'rds Carystus turn'dHis march, and reach'd her portals, while the sunWanted three hours to finish his career.There was a temple to Briareus built,The son of Titan. In th' enormous shrineHis image vast to thirty cubits rose
In darkest marble. Terror, thick with curlsO'erlaid the forehead, thick th' engraven beardThe spacious chest o'ershadow'd; fifty shields,As many maces of refulgent brassThe hundred hands upheld. Broad steps aroundThe pedestal ascended, that beforeTh' outstretch'd Titanian feet religious fearAccumulated off'rings might dispose,So to propitiate the tremendous god.In single state before this image stoodNicomachus, the archon, to receiveHis son triumphant with Cecropia's chief.They now had pass'd th' expanded gates, and slowApproach'd the shrine in military pompAlong th' extensive isle. The walls and domeReplied to fifes and trumpets, to the clinkOf manacles and fetters, piercing sound,Which told the wearer's guilt. Till now unmark'd,
A figure, grim and ghastly, from the crowdDarts, and a poniard plunging in the breastOf old Nicomachus, himself ascendsThe pedestal, and lifting his red steelOn high, between the god's gigantic feetIntrepid takes his station. Terror dimsEach gazing eye; th' illusive medium swellsHis size; in fancy'd magnitude he tow'rsAnother son of Titan. As he standsIntent to speak, Themistocles, aloneOf all th' assembly master of himself,Cool gives a sign, when thus th' assassin speaks,In phrase barbaric, and a soften'd look:I am that Oxus, whom suspicion marksA traitor to Cleora. Mistress dear,(At this a torrent gushes from his eyes)Thou knew'st me faithful. Listen, gracious lord,Thou tend'rest consort of the tend'rest wife,
O Hyacinthus! listen to my tale,Thou too wilt own me faithful: On the night,Thy first of absence from Cleora's bed,No more thy love to bless, assassins forc'dKind Glaucè's dwelling; me they bound; my voiceThey barr'd; the priestess and her blameless maidsThey strangled. Mounted on a rapid steedOne bore Cleora; two, robust and fell,Were my unresting guards. Through trackless woodsNot far we journey'd; Demonax was near,Just march'd to waste Eretria's neighb'ring land.Conducting me to loneliest shades, my guidesRemain'd a while conferring. One, I knew,Was Dacus, Dacus whom thy sire preferr'dIn trust to all his menials. Words like theseHe utter'd: 'Thus Nicomachus enjoin'd;'Transporting Oxus to obscurest wilds,'Destroy, conceal him there. Access by night
'To Demonax obtain; by earnest suit'From him exact a promise to declare,'That Oxus brought his daughter, then set free'Was sent rewarded to his Sacian home.'Receive the gold proclaim'd; depart. Be sure'No other name, than Oxus, pass your lips.'This said, they gor'd me with repeated wounds;I sunk before them; they believ'd me dead.Deep in a pit, o'ergrown with brambles thick,They left me. Woodmen, haply passing, heardMy piercing groans; in pity to a hutThey bore me; herbs medicinal, and time,Restor'd my strength. His garment he unfolds,The crimson horrors of his num'rous scarsTo shew. Carystians, I my vital breathAmong the Saces on the Caspian drew.A Genius dwells, a native in the lake,Who, in his function rising from the deep,
Reveals fou lmurder. Purple are his wings,His hue is jet, a diamond his eye,His hair is inextinguishable flame.Whatever man, his visitation warns,Neglects to right the dead, he haunts, he drivesTo horrid frenzy. On a whirlwind borne,To me in momentary flight he came,In terrors clad uncommon; o'er my couchHis clatt'ring pinions shook. His mandate highI have obey'd, the soulest murd'rer slain.Now, mistress dear, sole object of my zeal,Where'er thou art, if fleeting on some cloudA bright aerial spirit; if belowAmong the Genii of the earth, or seas,Dost trace the caves, where shine carbuncles pure,Or pluck the coral in cerulean grots,Thy faithful slave shall follow, still performWith his accustom'd vigilance thy will.This said, he struck the poniard through his breast,The blows repeating till he pierc'd the heart,Then on the crimson'd pedestal reclin'dHis dying limbs, nor groan'd. What thoughts were thine,Nicomachus! To thee are open'd wideDeath's portals; cold thy blood begins to flow.An injur'd son beside thee strives to doubtThat he, who gave him being, now descendsTo sure damnation for so black a crime;But thou remov'st all doubt. Thy sister's ghostBefore thee seems to glide, and point thy wayTo Erebus; Briareus' hundred handsTo brandish serpents, lashing from his faneA fordid, grovelling parricide to hell.At length, amid confession of thy guilt,The furies snatch thee from the light of heav'nTo that eternal gloom. The fainting limbsOf Hyacinthus forth Nicanor bears.
Religious dread beholds the shrine impureWith homicide; nor knows, what man, what godMust be consulted, or what rite perform'dTo purge from deeds thus ominous the fane;Till recollection prompts a sudden hope,That wise, and great, and favour'd from above,Themistocles may succour—He is gone.In double consternation all disperse.Night drops her curtain on the sleepless town.End of the Thirteenth Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the FOURTEENTH.BRIGHT morning sheds no gladness on the faceOf pale Carystu, who, in visions fram'dBy superstitious fear, all night had seenBriareus lift his hundred hands to crushHis fane polluted, from the base to rendEach pillar'd mass, and hurl the fragments hugeAgainst her tow'rs. Anon is terror chang'dTo wonder, which consoles her. Through her gates,Amid the lustre of meridian day,In slow procession, solemnly advance
A hundred youths in spotless tunics white,Sustaining argent wands. A vig'rous bandOf sacerdotal servitors succeed,Who draw by turns the silver-graven shapeOf Dian lofty on a wheeling stageOf artificial verdure. Virgins tallA guard surround her, each in flowing snowOf raiment, gather'd in a rosy knotAbove one knee. They tread in sandals white,O'erlac'd by roseate bands; behind their necksOf lilly's hue depend their quivers full;Hands, which can string their tough and pond'rous bows,Eyes, darting beams severe, discover strengthUnbroke by wedlock, hearts by love untam'd;Soft light the silver crescents on their headsDiffuse. Eudora follows in her car;Across her shoulders hangs a quiver large;Full-fac'd, a crystal moon illumes her hair.
Penthesilea's Amazonian armHad scarce the nerves to bend Eudora's bow.Her port, her aspect, fascinate the sight;Before her, passing, tow'rs and temples seemTo sink below her level; she becomesThe single object eminent; her neck,Her arms, the vestment shuts from view prophane;Low as her feet descends the sacred stole.Eight purple-harness'd steeds of milky hue,Her axle draw. Before her footstool sitsThe vanquisher of Xerxes; to the reinsOf argent lustre his obsequious handThemistocles applies. A hundred guardsIn burnish'd steel, and plumes like ridges newOf winter's fleeces, not unmartial rank'dBehind her wheels; the city's widest spaceThey reach. To all the people, swarming round,In awful state the priestess thus began:Impiety and parricide, which spiltIn Juno's sight her servant Glaucè's blood,Your god, by double homicide profan'd,May well dismay Carystus. Lo! I come,Afflicted city, in thy day of woeBoth to propitiate and conciliate heav'n.Learn first, no off'ring of a hundred bulls,Not clouds of incense, nor exhausted storesOf richest wine can moderate his wrath,Which visits children for the sire's offence,And desolates whole nations for the crimesOf kings and chiefs; unless by double zeal,By violence of virtue man disarmThe jealous thunderer. Happy is your lot;The capital offender still survives;On him inflicted vengeance by your hands,Men of Carystus, will from Jove regain,And multiply his blessings on yourselves,Your sons and daughters. Swear then, old and young,
Swear all before the fresh-polluted shrine;Ere you remove the carnage from that fane,Unite your valour by a gen'ral oath,That you will strengthen this Athenian's arm,Whom I from Dian, in the awful nameOf all the gods and goddesses, adjureTo quell the monster Demonax, by heav'n,By earth detested, parricide and scourgeTyrannic o'er Euboea. At these wordsShe fix'd an arrow in her mighty bow;Then rising, said; against an impious headIncens'd Diana thus her war declares.A cloud, low-hanging, instant by the forceOf springing wind a boreal course beganTow'rds Oreus; thither bent Eudora's eye.Swift from her sounding string through folds obscureOf that thick vapour, as it fleets away,The arrow imperceptibly descends
To earth. Fortuitous a sulph'rous sparkFlash'd from the cloud. A prodigy! exclaim'dThemistocles; the holy shaft is chang'dTo Jove's own bolt, and points the forked flameOn Demonax. Swear, swear, the people shout;A gen'ral exhortation rends the copeEthereal. Prompted by the subtil voiceOf her prevailing counsellor, againEudora solemn: You for once, my friends,Must supersede the strictness of your laws.Though Hyacinthus has not reach'd the date,Prescrib'd to those who wield the rule supreme,Elect him archon. Gallant, injur'd youth,Sage, pious, him Diana best approves,Him her unerring counsels will inspire.Me too, her priestess, in your need she lends;I will promulge the sacred oath to all;I from pollution will your town redeem.Unanimous consent is heard. Her carShe leaves. Before Briareus, in her words,Sons, fathers, youth and age, enlist their spears.Meantime th' Athenian to Nicanor's homeResorts. He passes to the chamber sad,Whence Hyacinthus utters these complaints:Dost thou, Nicanor, parallel with mineThe Oedipean horrors, or the pangsFelt by the race of Pelops, and deserv'd?Thus wouldst thou waken patience in a breast,Which feels affliction, far surpassing theirs,Feels undeserv'd affliction? Whom, O Jove!By error, lust, or malice have I wrong'd?Cut short my bloom—torment me here no more.Let Rhadamanthus instantly decide,If with Cleora I must taste of bliss,Or with a father drink eternal woe.
Here for a murder'd wife my eyes to streamShall never cease; and—execrable sire!Not grief, but all which furies can excite,Rage, detestation, horror I must feelFor thee, my origin of life—what life!Yet, O thou spirit damn'd, the wretch thy son,The wretch, a father's cruelty hath made,Perhaps might spare a tear—but Glaucè's ghost,Thy righteous, hallow'd sister's ghost, forbidsOne drop of pity on thy pains to fall—She skrieks aloud, curse, curse thy father's dust.Themistocles now enter'd. At his look,Which carry'd strange ascendancy, a spellControlling nature, was the youth abash'd;As if his just sensations were a shame,Or his complaints to reach that hero's earWere criminal. He falt'ring spake: Thou godOf Hyacinthus! passion thou dost awe;Thy presence humbles frenzy and despair.No, thy own manly fortitude aloneShall chase despair and frenzy from thy breast,Serene Themistocles reply'd: Arise,Thou new-created archon; private caresTo interfere with public, neither menNor gods allow, nor justice, nor the senseOf thy own wrongs. Young friend, the noble toilOf mind and body in this righteous causeWill give thee rank with heroes. Thou assist,Nicanor; share the glory. By the handHe led the passive youth. The people metTheir young, their honour'd magistrate in joy;Eudora bless'd them; then in solemn zealThe purifying rites perform'd, and leftReviv'd Carystus. To her holy seat,While on the way her goddess radiant shone,Themistocles attended; then by dawnBack to Eretria swiftly press'd his march.Not Aeolus, the king of winds, could stillTheir gust, nor Neptune smooth his troubled waves,Nor Jove the raging thunderbolt composeMore, than divine Themistocles had tam'dOppression, terror, anguish and despair.This had Geraestus in her evil day,The panic-aw'd Carystians this had prov'd,Not less than sad Eretria. Her he findsRejoicing, like some widow late forlorn,Who in the house of mourning with a trainOf pining orphans titute had But by a hand beneficent uprais'd,Ungirds the humble sackcloth from her loins,Nor longer sprinkles ashes on her head,Amid reviving plenty. Such the changeAmong the Eretrians, through the copious aidSicinus lent, within Chalcidic wallsStill sedulous abiding. Ev'ry faceThe gladd'ning touch of rosy-tinctur'd health
Illumines. Now from ruins clear'd, the streetsBy stable feet of passengers are trod;Th' impending season's turbulence to foil,Works, under Cleon's and Tisander's eyeBegun, the vig'rous populace, inspir'dBy their protector's presence, now pursueWith industry to match the beaver breedLaborious and sagacious, who constructBy native art their mansions, to repelCongealing air, and hoary drifts of snowIn winter's harsh domains. From day to dayThe toil continued. Early on a mornA stranger came, in body all deform'd,In look oblique, but keen; an eastern garbEnwrapp'd his limbs distorted; from his tongueFell barb'rous accents. He address'd the chiefIn Grecian phrase, which falter'd on his tongue:I am a Tyrian trafficker in slaves;Returning home from Libya, have been forc'd
By dang'rous winds to this Euboean coastFor shelter. Watching for a friendly gale,I learn'd from fame, that, warrior, thou dost wieldA sword which prospers, and its captives doomsTo servitude. Themistocles commandsThe sev'n Geraestian tyrants from his ship,Where at the bottom they had gnash'd their teethIn chains unslacken'd. To the merchant then:Without a price these miscreants from our climesRemove, the farthest hence will best repayThe obligation. For a master chuseThe most ferocious savage on the wildsOf horrid Scythia, or the Caspian bound.Secure conductors he appoints, a bandTo chain them fast aboard. Each irksome stepThey count in curses. O'er Euboea lost,Not as their native region, but the seat
Of pow'r and crimes triumphantly enjoy'd,They weep, still criminal in tears. But soon,When from the harbour distance had obscur'dThe well-row'd bark, the fetters from their limbsThe merchant orders, who, another tone,Another mien assuming, thus began:Geraestian lords, redemption you deriveFrom Demonax of Oreus. Me the firstAmong his council, Lamachus by name,He sent to practice on the wily chiefOf Athens, wiles which undermine his own.They land at Dium, thence to Oreus march;Where Demonax admits them, as he satIn secret council: 'Your disasters known'Obtain'd our instant succour. What intends'Themistocles?' This answer is return'd.Not less, great prince, Themistocles intendsThan thy destruction. Of Eretrian bloodAll who survive, Geraestus, Styra joinAgainst thy throne. Carystus from her wallsWill pour battalions, by Eudora fir'd.The Amarynthian priestess hath declar'dWar in Diana's name. The lab'ring hindWill quit the furrow; shepherds from their flocks,Youths from their sport, the keeper from his herdWill run to arms at her commanding voice,So prevalent the sound. The tyrant turnsTo Mindarus the Persian: Let us marchSwift to destroy the serpent in his egg.To him the Persian: Demonax forgets,That winter's rigour chills the soldier's blood.Dost thou not hear the tempest, while it howlsAround us? Ev'n Mardonius active, bold,Now rests in covert of Thessalian roofs,
Nor fights with nature. Shall my gen'ral hearThat I conduct the race of hottest climesIn freezing rain and whirlwinds to assailA strong-wall'd town, protected by a chiefFor valour, skill, and stratagem renown'd,With all th' unsparing elements his guard?Again the tyrant: Mindarus, confineThy Asiatics, till the roses bud;While I, in howling storms, in damps, or frostWill head my own Euboeans. Heav'n forbid!The wary Lamachus subjoins: My lord,Repose no trust without thy foreign bandsIn these new subjects. Gods! th' alluring guileOf that Athenian would dissolve thy ranks,To his own hostile banner would seduceHalf thy battalions. Demonax again:Then policy with policy shall war.Among th' Eretrians publish, from their hands
This virulent Athenian I requireBound and deliver'd to my will; their wives,Their children else, late captives of my sword,Shall from their state of servitude be dragg'dTo bleed th' immediate victims of my wrath.Then Mindarus: Should great Mardonius hear,That I such inhumanity permit,He would exert his full monarchal pow'r,My guilty limbs condemning to a cross.In fury foaming, Demonax exclaims:I am betray'd. Thee, Mindarus, the sonOf that stern prince, who laid Eretria waste,Thee Xerxes, future sov'reign of the world,Appointed my supporter; in this isleThat I, a branch from his imperial root,Might grow a splendid vassal of his throne.My cause, his service, now thy heart disowns,
Perverse thy sword abandons. Of my friendsThou best requited, most ingrate! Preferr'dOnce to have been my son, of treasures vastThe destin'd heir, my successor in sway,Dost thou desert me, and protect my foes?But to Mardonius, to the mighty king,I will accuse thee. By th' infernal pow'rsThemistocles hath gain'd thee; or thou fear'stTo face that captain on the field of war.His breast the Persian striking, thus in tears:Dost thou recall thy parricide to woundMy inmost bosom? though another heldMy dear Cleora by the holiest ties,I would have struggled with despairing love;But sink o'erwhelm'd by horror of that deed,Which, blasting such perfection, calls on heav'nFor punishment unbounded. If thou fall'st,It is the hand of Horomazes weighs
To earth a body overcharg'd with guilt.Dost thou upbraid me, undeserving man,Forgetting recent service? Who restor'dThy scepter lost? what captain hath reduc'dOrobia, Dium, half Euboea's towns,But Mindarus? He these atchievements pastRegrets, but while appointed by his princeWill urge his duty to accomplish new.Then come the season for a warrior's toil,Themistocles shall see my banner guideTwelve thousand spears; shall see my early swordTo gen'ral battle, or to single fight,Defy th' experience of his pow'rful arm.He said, and left the council. All withdrewBut Lamachus. The tiger, when escap'd,Or fell hyaena from an eager chaceOf dogs and hunters, feels not more dismay,Mix'd with a thirst insatiate of revenge,
Than shook the monster Demonax, who thusTo Lamachus: Insulted and controul'dBy an audacious stranger, do I ruleIn Oreus longer? By a poison'd draught,Or midnight poniard Mindarus shall die.Ariobarzanes, second in command,Will serve me best. The counsellor subjoins:If secret poison, or a midnight blowWould remedy the grievance, I would tryTheir instant operation; but reflect,Twelve thousand warriors, masters of thy fate,Who love their gen'ral living, on his deathMight prove too harsh inquisitors. At leastHis courage use once more on open foes;A valiant leader makes the soldier brave;So have we found in Mindarus. ReserveAssassination for a greater mark,Themistocles. The tyrant quick: ProclaimFive golden talents on his head the price.Discreet, though wicked, Lamachus again:Wouldst thou incense all Greece, whose navy rulesThe main? Howe'er triumphant in the field,No timely help Mardonius could extend.The genius of Themistocles, the nymphOf Salamis indignant by his side,Would range from state to state. Their loud alarmWould send the whole confederated fleetBefore the earliest breezes of the springTo pour vindictive myriads on our coast.Then what our doom? No, Demonax, my lord,These sev'n Geraestians, while thy recent graceTransports their minds, and blows the embers hotOf rage at recent insult, let us leagueAgainst this formidable man by oathsBefore the furies in their neighb'ring cave.Thyself be present. Yes, the monster said,I will be present, though Cleora's ghostBe there, and that vile produce, which disgrac'd
Her virgin zone! Remembrance of his guilt,He rous'd to strengthen fury and revenge.There was a cavern in the bowels deepOf naked rock by Oreus, where the sternEumenides possess'd a dusky shrine,And frown'd in direful idols from the timeThat Titan's offspring o'er Euboea reign'dThe enemies of Jove. Around it sleptA stagnant water, overarch'd by yews,Growth immemorial, which forbade the windsE'er to disturb the melancholy pool.To this, the fabled residence abhorr'dOf hell-sprung beings, Demonax, himselfPredominating daemon of the place,Conducts the sev'n assassins. There no priestOfficiates; single there, as Charon grim,A boatman wafts them to the cavern's mouth.They enter, fenc'd in armour; down the black
Descent, o'er moist and lubricated stone,They tread unstable. Night's impurest birdsWith noisome wings each loathing visage beat;Of each the shudd'ring flesh through plated steelBy slimy efts, and clinging snakes is chill'd;Cold, creeping toads beset th' infected way.Now at the cave's extremity obsceneThey reach the sisters three, tremendous forms,Of huge, mishapen size. Alecto there,Tisiphoné, Megaera, on their frontsDisplay their scorpion curls; within their graspTheir serpents writh'd. Before them sulph'rous firesIn vases broad, antiquity's rude toil,To render horror visible, diffus'dSuch light, as hell affords. Beside a chasm,Whose bottom blind credulity confin'dBy Tartarus alone, with trembling feetStood Lamachus, the wicked and deform'd.An ewe, in dye like ebony, he gor'd;
The dark abyss receiv'd a purple stream.Next to the dire conspirators he heldA vessel; o'er the brim their naked armsThey stretch'd; he pierc'd the veins; th' envenom'd blood,A fit libation mix'd for hell, he pour'dDown the deep cleft; then falt'ring, half dismay'dAt his own rites, began: Ye injur'd men,Of wealth and honours violently spoil'd,Implacably condemn'd to bonds and rodsBy insolent Themistocles, beforeThese dreadful goddesses you swear; his deathYou vow, by every means revenge can prompt,In secret ambush, or in open fight,By day, by night, with poison, sword, or fire;Else on your heads you imprecate the wrathOf these inexorable pow'rs. They swore.Meantime the object of their impious oaths,Whate'er his future destiny, enjoy'd
The comforts which Eretria now partookThrough him, so justly her preserver styl'd;While thus reflection whisper'd to his heart:This Aristides would delight to see,For this commend his rival. Though my soulKnows that in quest of glory for this portI spread th' advent'rous sail, yet sweeter farShe feels that glory, since a gallant race,Snatch'd from the gripe of misery and deathBy her exalted faculties, becomeHer means of pow'r and greatness. I confess,An act like this my rival would achieve,Nor other motive seek, than acting well.Perhaps with more attention to myself,More sudden, more complete is my success.Lo! in his view Sicinus, just arriv'dFrom Chalcis. Him his joyful lord thus hail'd:We have been long asunder; welcome thrice,Thou long expected; on thy brow I seeIntelligence. To whom the faithful man:One moon I spent in Chalcis; I address'dNearchus first, of Chares, slain in fightAt Artemisium, successor approv'dTo lead his country's banners. He rejoic'dIn thy arrival; not so frank in joyTimoxenus the archon. On the dayOf my return that hesitating chief,While invitation to his roof he gave,Was dreading thy acceptance. But supremeO'er him, and all his house, a daughter sways,In beauty's full meridian left to mournThe loss of Chares on her widow'd bed.Not thy Timothea, not Cleander's spouseTraezene's wonder, not Sandauce young,Not Medon's sister of th' Oetaean hill,
Though beauteous like the goddesses she serves,Exceed Acanthè; she may almost vyeWith Amarantha's celebrated form,The pride of Delphian Timon! To beholdThe conqueror of Xerxes is her wish.The hero thought a moment; soon resolv'd,He spake: The car, the mantle, Sparta's gifts,The gems from Ariabignes won that day,When at my feet his proud tiara bow'd,Provide by dawn. Retire we now to rest.End of the Fourteenth Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the FIFTEENTH.NOW dimm'd by vapours, frequent in his track,The twelfth division of his annual roundThe sun is ent'ring. Long hath vernal bloom,Hath summer's prime from thy descriptive lays,O Muse! withdrawn; and now the aged yearIts last remains of beauty hath resign'd;Transparent azure of autumnal skiesIs chang'd to mist, the air serene to storms.But inspiration from th' imagin'd balmOf spring, or summer's warmth, enrich'd by sweets
From flow'ry beds, and myrtles' fragrant bow'rs,Thou dost not want; then bid thy numbers rollIn cadence deep to imitate the voiceOf boist'rous winter in his mantle hoar.All night by rude Hippotades the airTormented round the foaming harbour wheel'd;Each mast was pliant to the raging gust,The mooring cable groan'd. Long slept the sonOf Neocles, unvisited by care,Till, as the hours attendant on the mornHad just unclos'd the orient gate of day,He starts. Acanthè, who controuls her sire,His active fancy pictures on his mindThus pond'ring: Dear Timothea, yet less dearThan pow'r and fame acquir'd by saving Greece,Without Chalcidic aid thy husband's hopeIs meer abortion. Chalcis must be gain'dBest, Aristides, by the purest means,
But well by any. Swift his inner garbOf softest wool thick-woven he assumes,Of finer texture then a scarlet vest;O'er these, in dye of violet's deep hue,His Spartan mantle negligently waves.A golden tissue with a crimson plume,To fence his manly temples and adorn,He wears. His car is ready; ready waitTh' Eretrian people, his conducting guardTo Chalcis not remote. The sounding wayIs hard and hoar; crystalline dew congeal'dHath tipt the spiry grass; the waters, boundIn sluggish ice, transparency have lost;No flock is bleating on the rigid lawn,No rural pipe attunes th' inclement air;No youths and damsels trip the choral roundBeneath bare oaks, whose frost-incrusted boughsDrop chilling shadows; icicles investThe banks of rills, which, grating harsh in strife
With winter's fetters, to their dreary sidesNo passenger invite. The cautious chiefIn sight of Chalcis to their homes dismiss'dThe whole Eretrian number, but retain'dHis hundred Attic and Laconian friends:He pass'd the gate before expiring day.Sicinus, staid forerunner, not unknownBy residence in Chalcis, publish'd loudHis lord's approach. The citizens in throngsSalute the celebrated man. His gatesTimoxenus the archon throws abroad,And, true to hospitality, preparesFor his distinguish'd, though unwelcome guest,Her lib'ral rites. Themistocles he leadsTo share a banquet in a sumptuous hall,Where stands divine Acanthè. Is there wife,Or maid, or widow'd matron, now in Greece,Who would not all her ornaments assume
To welcome this known saviour of the GreeksWhere'er he passes? As the queen of heav'nIn dazzling dress to match her goddess form,Grac'd by the zone of Cytherea, metTh' Olympian king on Ida; brilliant thusAcanthè greets Themistocles. MatureIn manhood he, nor bord'ring on decline,The ornamental cov'ring from his headLifts in obeisance; careless curls releas'd,Thick overshadowing his forehead high,Present a rival to the Phidian frontOf Jupiter at Pisa. With a look,Which summon'd all his talents, all his mindTo view, he blends a sweetness, nature's gift,But heighten'd now by energy of wiles,Alluring wiles, to melt the proudest fair.In his approach he moves the genuine sireOf all the Graces on Acanthè's handTo print his lips. Invited by that hand,
Close to her lovely side of her aloneHe sits observant, while the rich repastContinu'd. Soon his vigilance perceiv'd,That her unsated ear devour'd his words,That from her lip an equal spell enthrall'dHer doating father, who adoring view'dMinerva in Acanthè. Now withdrawnWas all attendance, when the daughter thus:O first of men, sole grace of each abodeWhere thou art present, fortunate are thoseWho saw thy actions, fortunate who hearThe bare narration; happier still those ears,Which from thy mouth can treasure in the mindA full impression of the glorious tale!Forgive a woman, whom thy manners temptTo sue—if yet thy gentleness should deemToo curious, too importunate her suit,Thy host Timoxenus at least indulge,
That o'er his festive hall th' achievements high,Which Salamis and Artemisium saw,Though now but whisper'd from thy gracious lips,May sound hereafter loud. The wily chief,Ne'er disinclin'd to celebrate his deeds,Now to this lovely auditress, whose aidHis further fame requir'd, a tale began,Where elegance of thought, and paint of words,Embellish'd truth beyond her native guise,In various lengthen'd texture of discourse,A web of pleasing wonders to ensnareThe hearer's heart. Till midnight he pursuesA strain like magic to the list'ning fair;Nor yet his thread to Salamis had reach'd,Extended fine for many sweet repastsTo her inflam'd desire of hearing more.Timoxenus at length to due reposeImparts the signal; they disperse. Her guest
Delights Acanthè's pillow; but her sireIn care lies anxious, lest the season rudeDetain that guest, and fatal umbrage giveTo Demonax terrific. Morn and eveReturn. Acanthè drinks the pleasing streamOf eloquence exhaustless in its flow,Whose draughts repeated but augment her thirst.Now in description's animating glossThe various scenes at Salamis exaltThe fair one's mind. The Attic wives and maidsShe emulates in wish, and sees in thoughtTheir beauteous ranks inspiring youth and ageTo battle; now the tumult rude of Mars,The crashing oars, the bloody-streaming decksChill her soft bosom; now that snowy seatOf gen'rous pity heaves; her azure eyesMelt o'er Sandauce, in her years of bloomDisconsolately widow'd, and transpierc'd
By death-like horror at her children doom'dTo savage Bacchus. Here the artful manDwells on his own humanity, but hidesThe stratagem, which policy, not dimm'dBy his compassion, on compassion built,When to her freedom he restor'd the fair,Who blameless help'd his artifice to driveFrom Greece her royal brother. To the worthOf Artamanes tribute just he pays.His own reception by the Spartan stateHe colours high, the public chariot giv'n,The purple mantle, and the coursers proud,Deriv'd from those, who won th' Olympian wreathFor Demaratus; but omits to speak,How, while seducing vanity misledHis steps so far from Athens, she conferr'dThe naval guidance on Xanthippus brave,And rule supreme on Aristides just.Th' ensnaring story, to this period drawn,While sev'n nocturnal rounds the planets ran,Possesses all Acanthè, but disturbsHer timid father, trembling at the pow'rOf Demonax; yet fondness oft would smileOn her delight. The evening which succeedsThemistocles, in fiction mix'd with truth,Not to Acanthè, but his host, began:Accompany'd from Sparta by the flow'rOf her illustrious citizens I gain'dHer borders, there indignant was appris'd,That Demonax, whom heretofore I chac'dFrom Oreus, now by Persian arms restor'd,Was trampling on Euboea. Vengeance fir'dMy spirit; fifty of the Spartan troopAt once became associates of my zeal,With fifty nobles more of Attic blood.My full stor'd vessels at Eretria's port
From Sunium's cape arriv'd. He now unfoldsThe wond'rous series of his recent deeds.What divers passions, sweet Acanthè, riseIn thy attentive, gen'rous mind? What sighsDo Hyacinthus and Cleora wake,What horror black Nicomachus, what joyReviv'd Eretria, and Geraestus freed,What admiration great Eudora's state,What rev'rence good Tisander's sacred locks,What detestation Demonax accurs'd?Behold me here, Themistocles concludes,Who lift in Athens' and Laconia's name,A guardian shield o'er Chalcis. But thy sword,Offensive drawn, shall utterly confoundThe homicide thy neighbour. Ah! repliesTimoxenus, alarm'd, thou little know'stThe might of Oreus. Demonax can rangeTwelve thousand warriors cull'd from Asia's host,Of train'd Euboean youth and light-arm'd slaves
A multitude innum'rous on the plain.His own exactions, and the Persian's boons,O'erload his treasure. When the annual sunIn his new course three monthly terms hath fill'd,Expect Mardonius from Thessalia's boundsOn Greece to pour invasion. Ah! what help,Should we exchange tranquillity for war,From her own wants could Attica supply,What Lacedaemon?—Cool th' Athenian here:Weigh well the grace your Polyphemus dy'dIn carnage grants, reserving for his last,Most precious morsel, your Chalcidian wealth.Shall this rich mansion, casket to a gemWhich none can value (earnest here he caughtAcanthè's earnest look) shall this abodeFeel pillage, insult, which my shudd'ring mindScarce dares to think, from that despoiler's hand,Who, scourging half Euboea, in this hour
Dreads thee, great archon? Murderer, who cutHis own Cleora's thread in early bloom,He trembles now, Timoxenus, at thee,O bless'd of parents, blessing such a childAs thy Acanthè; he thy vengeance dreads,O paragon of fathers, dreads thy swordUnsheath'd with mine. Presumption I disclaim,Or want of def'rence to the wise like thee.Accept this roll; contemplate there the forceOf Amarynthus, of Carystus large,Geraestus and Eretria; add the spearsOf Delphian Timon, of that hero fam'd,Oilean Medon, who my signal watchFrom Atalantè's isle. Remote the timeFor action; then deliberate. I waitWithout impatience thy resolves mature.Retir'd, Acanthè, whose enlighten'd mindWas bless'd with native talents, as her form
With beauty, strives a while in reason's scaleTo weigh th' importance of this high attemptPropos'd; when something whispers, canst thou doubtThemistocles a moment? Can his swordDo less, than conquer? Where the pow'rful arm,The valour, where the policy to vieWith him, whose faculties no man can reach,No god raise higher? These conceptions proveA guide to fancy half the sleepless nightThrough all th' enchanting scenery of thought,Which recollection of his brilliant deeds,His courage, might, humanity, and grace,His gentle manners, and majestic frame,Exhibits lovely, dazzling and sublimeTo melt her softness, and her wisdom blind.Envelop'd now by slumber, in a dream,Which overleaps all measur'd time and space,She sees the laurell'd hero, as return'dFrom subjugated Oreus. On his spear
The gory head of Demonax he bears.Her yet untainted purity of heart,Which in sincerity of grief had mourn'dCleora's fate, applauds the just awardBy Nemesis and Themis on the guiltOf parricide. Her nobleness of soulEnjoys the blessings which Euboea reapsFrom such a conquest; but no vision kindWould interpose a warning to allayExcess of transport at the conqu'ror's sight.From fair Acanthè's own retreat at nightA well-embellish'd gallery's long rangeBounds on the splendid chamber, which admitsThemistocles to rest. Acanthè here,When magisterial duties from his homeHer father call'd, had entertain'd the guestBy morn, and feasted all and every mornOn rich profusion of his Attic words.
The sun was ris'n, and summon'd from her couchTo this accustom'd interview the fair.Not meeting straight the object of her search,As each preceding morn, she feels a pain,That he is absent. With a voice though lowHis chamber sounds; to listen she disdains,Back to her own by delicacy led.In cautious tones Sicinus with his lordWas thus discoursing: In my wonted walk,To watch events since thy arrival here,I met Nearchus. Haste, he said, appriseThemistocles that long ere op'ning dayHis potent friends Timoxenus conven'd,Heads of his faction. They refuse to arm.Some, I suspect, are tainted by the goldOf Demonax; the major part in allObey the timid archon. I have strength,Which, when Themistocles commands, shall try
To force compliance from the coward's breast;But would Acanthè, noble dame, espouseThe glorious cause, her prevalence could guideHis doating fondness, and controul his fears.Enough, replies Themistocles. AgainThe learned tutor, fervent and sincere:If thy persuasive eloquence could winHer noble spirit to direct her sire,It would be well. But, O resistless man,Let thy persuasion moderate its charm;Let not a gen'rous lady's peace of mindBecome the victim of her winning guest;The laws of hospitality revere.Remember too the hymeneal vow,Remember thy Timothea, fair and kind,Who bore those children, pupils of my care;She now in Athens at thy absence pines.Misjudging friend, Timothea never pines,When I am urging my career of fame,Returns the chief. Euboeans must be freed.She shall know all, and knowing will commend.Go, charge Nearchus to suppress all thoughtOf violence; his valour shall have scope,Dy'd in Barbarian, not in civil blood.Thus he, well-caution'd that in Chalcis pow'rAristocratic, both in wealth and strength,Out-weigh'd the people. Then a splendid gem,Of all his spoils the richest, he selects,And from his chamber o'er the sounding plank,Which floors the echoing gallery, proceeds.Behold Acanthè; not the orient skyForth from its amber gates in summer's primeThe goddess-widow of Tithonus sendsMore fragrant, nor in blushes more to charm.A new emotion heaves her gentle breast
Of swelling snow. Th' Athenian distant, muteRemains. To speak, her hesitating lipsA while, though prompted by her heart, delay;When, shap'd by chance, this elegant requestFlows from her unpremeditated thoughts:So much oblig'd already, courteous guest,By thy narration, I have cause to blushWhile I solicit a recital newOf one exploit, distinguish'd from the rest,When Ariabignes fell before thy swordIn sight of Greece. Themistocles requir'dNo repetition of the flatt'ring suit,But in transcendent energy of style,Impress'd the bright achievement on her mindMore deep, than ev'n by novelty before.Thus he concluded: Doubly now I blessTh' auspicious hour when my successful hand
Despoil'd the bravest chief in Asia's hostOf this, my humble off'ring to adornThe fairest head in Greece. He said, the gemPresenting graceful, which she turn'd aside,Rejecting not the giver, but the gift;And answer'd thus: To heaps of richest gems,To all the tribute pour'd at Persia's throne,Thy words alone, thy converse I prefer.Her look perusing earnest, he proceeds:Dost thou refuse a token of regardFrom one, thy hospitable hand hath bless'dBeyond th' expression of his grateful tongue?When, at this hour departing, he againPerhaps may ne'er behold thee—Ah! depart!She in unguarded consternation sighs.Th' Athenian here in seeming sadness thus:Alas! thy father, I too surely know,
Will never join my arms; can I remainTill this fair city, populous and rich,This mansion, thy inestimable worth.Become the prey of Demonax—This heav'nWill ne'er permit, she eagerly replies;Thou wilt protect me—Guardian to distress,Thou wilt not hurry to desert a friend,Whose hospitable kindness thou hast prais'd.Fill, fill with pow'rful argument the mouthOf me thy suppliant for another week;My words Timoxenus regards. . . The chiefBy interruption sooths her troubled mind:I came to save thee. If another weekThou wilt employ. . . I will, I will, she said,Do thou but stay; my father I will bindTo thee, whom victory can ne'er forsake.They part; his chamber he regains; not longHe meditates. Acanthè grants her aid
Spontaneous. Now to elevate her soulBy dignity of thought, and gen'rous hopeOf glory, purchas'd by a noble deed,He thus contrives: On tablets fair and large,For her deportment tow'rds a doating sire,His ready style instruction copious draws,Clos'd in these words: 'Among the guardians heav'n'To Greece hath destin'd, an exalted mind'Enrolls Acanthè; let her constant feet'Pursue her leading genius; grateful flow'rs'Before her steps shall freed Euboea strew;'The brightest laurels shall Minerva chuse'Among the groves of Athens, to entwine'The first of women with immortal wreaths;'The Muses all shall triumph in their sex;'A double rapture Aeschylus shall feel,'Who, fam'd in martial action, as in song,
'Shall celebrate Acanthè.' To her handThis by discreet Sicinus is convey'd.Day after day the fair-one, as inspir'd,Now forcibly persuasive, now in tearsOf importuning tenderness, assailsA parent fond. She penetrates his heart;His resolution melts; at length his fearsTo her superior guidance yield the rein.Meantime, instructed by their chief, the trainOf Spartans and Athenians, all dispers'dAround the hospitable town, proclaim,To list'ning ears, the well-advis'd designAgainst the tyrant Demonax. Not longAcanthè's purpose is unknown, divulg'dBy vigilant Sicinus; while each mindAmong th' applauding populace is warm'd,Who venerate her name. Among the chiefs
The archon's weighty approbation known,Hath banish'd doubt; in council they decideTo march with great Themistocles. Light fameMounts on her wings, and through Euboea soundsThe preparations ardent. Shields and spears,Swords, corselets, helms new furbish'd, banners oldProduc'd, which gallant ancestry had wav'd,Youth now commences, ripen'd age renewsThe exercise of arms. Nearchus loudExtols Themistocles. Like glorious MarsFrom his first trophies on Phlegraean fieldsAmong encircling brethren of the sky,Who from his sword perpetual conquest hop'd,The Salaminian victor is rever'dIn Chalcis. Daily, hourly he surveysThe martial toil. Acanthè's presence aids;His prudence leads her through these active scenes;He talks on military themes alone,And pictures freedom trampling on the necks
Of tyrants and Barbarians. This at lengthMight have abated in a virtuous breastThe flame, his guilty policy had rais'd;But fate and black conspiracy forbid.End of the Fifteenth Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the SIXTEENTH.THAT month severe, unfolding to the sunA frosty portal, whence his steeds renewTheir yearly round, was clos'd. O'ercome at nightBy toil uncommon, lay th' Athenian chiefIn early sleep profound, which early freedHis eyes again. In suffocating fumesHe wakes. Upstarting, round his limbs he wrapsTh' external garment, and Sicinus calls,Who slept not distant. He unbars a door,Which shews the gallery in flames. Down sinks
The crackling floor. A main sustaining beamFrom end to end, transverse another, standsYet unconsum'd. Lo! trembling in his viewAcanthè; inextinguishable flamesBetween them rage. A moment he devotesTo eye the gulph, which menaces with deathHim and his hopes, in him the Grecian weal.Would Aristides hesitate thus longTo save the meanest? I before me seeOn life's last verge a creature half divine.Urg'd by that thought, along the burning beamHe rushes swift. He catches in his armsThe loose-rob'd fair-one, clinging round his neck.Returning, not like Orpheus, who regain'dEurydicè and lost, with matchless strengthHe holds his prize above the pointed spiresOf fiery volumes, which on either side
Assail his passing steps. The son of JoveNot more undaunted through the livid blazeOf Pluto's mansion bore the victim pureOf conjugal affection back to life,Alcestis. Lo! Sicinus stops his feetIn their mid course. Thy chamber flames, he cries;Speed o'er this traverse beam; yon open doorLeads to a passage yet unscorch'd. He guides;The hero follows; danger here augments.As through a swelling tide he wades through fire,Which scath'd his brows, his blazing beard and hair,Nor spar'd the garments of his precious charge;Yet her unhurt through that befriending doorHis unrelax'd rapidity conveys.Of pain regardless to the public streetHe thence descends; no populace is here;That front vulcanian fury had not reach'd;The other draws the throng; confusion there
Prevails, uproar and terror. On he speedsThrough frozen air, and falling flakes of snow,Unwearied still his lovely burden holds,Acanthè fainting; her uncover'd breast,Unless that ringlets of her locks unboundLet fall at times their loose and silky threads,Against his cheek with marble coldness press'd.At last the dwelling of Nearchus nighAffords a refuge. On a friendly bed,But not of rest, Themistocles in painExtends his limbs; Acanthè female slavesReceive and cherish. Absent is their lord,Who, at the head of military filesIn haste collected, early, but in vainHad issued forth. The palace is consum'd.Timoxenus to shelter he conducts;The archon, trembling for his daughter's fate,Beholds her safe, and feels no other loss.Now all salute Themistocles; but firstSicinus spake: Infernal arts have laidThy palace waste, Timoxenus. I sawSulphureous, glutinous materials blazeClose to the chamber of my lord's repose.From lips nigh parch'd by torture of his painsThemistocles began: My earthly termIf heav'n requir'd me now to close, enoughI have atchiev'd to fill the trump of fame.To have preserv'd thy daughter, gen'rous host,Would crown my glory! Medon is not far;Well would that chief my vacant post supply,Were I remov'd. But, friends, my hurts are light,Which common succour of Machaon's artWill soon repair; yet publish you my stateAs dang'rous; words and looks observe; keen spiesTo Oreus send. Thus caution'd, each retir'dExcept Sicinus, who address'd his lord:Wilt thou trust rumour in her flight at largeTo sound thy state as dang'rous? Shall a taleTo cozen foes, and try thy new allies,Pass unrefuted to Cecropian shores,Rive thy Timothea's bosom, grieve thy friends,Dismay all Athens, and suspend that aidWhich she might lend thee in some adverse hour?The hero then: O monitor expert!Thou hast forestall'd me; instant will I spareThee to prevent such fears. Thou canst not stemThe vex'd Euripus. From Geraestus sail;To my Timothea fly. Thy looks enquireHow to relate my story: Tell her all;I have been faithful to my nuptial vow,Yet have succeeded. Let th' Athenians knowMy force and destin'd enterprize; forbearOf them to crave assistance; let them actAs humour sways. Cleander shouldst thou meet,
In kindest greetings tell him, I should prizeTroezenian succour—To its healing foldsI am solicited by sleep—Farewell.Not so Acanthè's troubles are compos'd.When lenient balm of Morpheus steep'd the caresOf other bosoms, in the midnight dampsShe quits a thorny pillow. Half array'd,With naked feet she roams a spacious floor,Whence she contemplates that retreat of rest,Inclosing all her wishes, hapless fair,Without one hope; there stifling sighs, she meltsIn silent tears. The sullen groan of winds,Which shake the roof, the beating rain she hearsUnmov'd, nor heeds stern winter, who benumbsHer tender beauties in his harsh embrace.O Love! to vernal sweets, to summer's air,To bow'rs, which temper sult'ry suns at noon,
Art thou confin'd? To rills in lulling flow,To flow'rs, which scent thy arbours of recess,To birds, who sing of youth and soft desire?All is thy empire, ev'ry season thine,Thou universal origin of things,Sole ruler, oft a tyrant. Stealing stepsFull frequent draw Acanthè to the doorOf her preserver. While he sleeps, and painExcites no groan to wound her list'ning ear,Anxiety abates; but passion grows.Then recollecting his intrepid stridesThrough fiery surge, devouring, as he pass'd,His hair majestie, wreathing round his limbsIn torment, which none else to save her lifeWould face, or could endure, unguarded thoughtIn murm'ring transport issues from her lips.To boundless obligation can I shewLess, than unbounded gratitude—Base tongue,
Dar'st thou the name of gratitude profane,Which is a virtue—Oh! thou impious flameWithin my breast, not gratitude hath blownThee from a spark to so intense a heat.Deprav'd Acanthè, vagabond impureOf night, from honour and its laws estrang'd,A robber's criminal desire of spoilThou feel'st, a rage of sacrilege to forceThe sanctuary of Hymen, and that fire,Which law, religion, men and gods protect,Quench on his altar by the hand of vice.She could no more. A parting cloud reveal'dThe moon. Before the silver light she dropp'dOn her bare knee, enfeebled by the cold;There fix'd and freezing, from that awful pow'rOf chastity she seem'd invoking help;When, newly-waken'd by her piercing moan,With smarting limbs Themistocles had left
His pillow; keener his internal pang,To see an image of despair, the workOf his fallacious art. On his approach,At once the worn remains of spirit fledFrom her cold bosom, heaving now no more.The twilight glimmers on the rear of night;His painful arms uplift her from the floor,And to her couch with decency of careCommit her lifeless charms. To sense restor'd,Just as the morn's exploring eye unclos'd,Acanthè, faint and speechless, by a signForbids his presence; cautious he retires.Now she indulg'd her agonies of shameAnd self-reproach. With horrid visions teem'dHer agitated brain; black-rob'd despairStalk'd round her curtains, in his double graspA bloody poniard, and empoison'd bowlTo her sad choice upholding; but ere long
That thirsty, parching malady, which boilsThe putrid blood, and ravages like fire,Invades her frame. Whole days, whole nights she sawA tender sire beside her pillow mourn,Her beauties wasting hourly in his view.To gentler forms delirium then would change;The moon, so lately to her aid invok'd,She saw, descending from her lucid sphere,Assume her shape of goddess, who inspir'dA soothing thought to seek for health and peaceAt her propitious oracle, not robSo kind a father of his only joy.Meantime the tidings vague of Chalcis burn'd,And great Themistocles destroy'd, had fameProclaim'd aloud through each Euboean town,Save where Sicinus, passing to his portOf embarkation, spreads a milder tale,Alarming still. Eretria scarce confines
Tisander's falt'ring age; but Cleon thence,From Styra Lampon hastes; Geraestus sendsEudemus; Hyacinthus feels no moreHis own distress, and rapid, as the birdOf Jupiter through heav'n's aerial way,Flies to his guardian friend. Eudora, skill'dIn healing juices, condescends to mountHerself the sacred axle, and her stateDisplays in Chalcis worshipping her wheels.The archon waits respectful on her steps,When she salutes th' Athenian, still recluseFrom public view, though nigh restor'd. He bendsThe knee before her. Him with stately graceShe raises, then addresses: Glad I seeThy convalescence; to impart my helpBecame a duty. So Diana will'd,By me consulted in her solemn groveMysterious; where an impulse warn'd my soul,
That none, but thou, can set Euboea free,Protect the temples, and her tyrant quell.He kiss'd her sacred vestment, and replied:I now perceive how pow'rful are thy pray'rs.To them, so favour'd by the gods, I oweMy preservation, which, O learn'd and wise,Forestalls thy skill! Ah! since thy face hath deign'dTo cheer this city, by a long abodeComplete the blessing. As to ancient TroyWas that Palladian image sent from heav'n,Be thou to Chalcis. At thy presence knownPale Demonax will shrink. But first applyThy lenient succour to my friend's distress,Whose daughter pines in sickness, and deservesThy full regard, most holy and benign.To sad Acanthè's couch the archon leadsEudora. Soon from Oreus tidings stern
Awake the native terrors in his heart;In haste he greets Themistocles: O guest!Fierce Demonax assembles all his force,But first will try an embassy; expectWithin three days the tyrant's fell demands,Which, not accepted, bring th' avenging wasteOf his redoubled fury on our heads.Is he so poor in counsellors, beganTh' Athenian calm? Amid disabling stormsIn this rough season will th' insensate bruteDrag to the field his Asiatic host?He thinks me dead; remember thou, my friend,Themistocles is living, nor conceiveThe rash, disturb'd and self-tormenting breastOf such a tyrant, whom the furies haunt,Hath fortitude and conduct to withstandThemistocles in arms. Not half-reviv'dSubjoins the archon: Thou alas! may'st want
The brave auxiliars promis'd to thy arms;To thee alike unfriendly are the stormsWhich lock our harbours; not a bark can sail;Illustrious Medon dares not plough the surgeFrom Atalantè; nor on Attic shoresOf our distress can Aristides hear.True, answers firm Themistocles, though stung,Nor shall we want him. Is not Cleon here,Nearchus, Lampon, sharers of successIn my preceding conflicts? Of no priceIs staid Eudemus, Hyacinthus brave?Is not Eudora present, sacred dame,Who will her face majestical unveilAmong confederated ranks to blessThe Eleutherian banner, and inspireYour populace with all religion's flame?Yon despicable embassy prepareTo answer nobly, or let me be heard.Now to this chamber summon all my friends.Timoxenus conven'd them. Swift the chiefDispatch'd them ardent to their native states,Thence their collected citizens in arms,The guardians of Chalcidic walls, to lead.Three days elaps'd; the embassy arriv'd.Amid the senate, on his chair of state,The archon sat. Th' Athenian's sure supportBehind is planted. Fierce in tone and lookTh' Orēan herald represents his lord:Ye men of Chalcis, Demonax requiresThat you acknowledge Xerxes; that your gatesA Persian garrison admit. Be wise;Refusal draws perdition on your heads.Timoxenus turns pale; his falt'ring lipsMake no reply. Th' indignant senate mournTheir state dishonour'd by a timid chief,
When timely steps Themistocles in sight;Whose name is murmur'd through th' applauding court.As at the aspect of a single cloud,Known by the trembling seaman to containDestructive blasts, the sail he swiftly furlsWith anxious wish for shelter in the leeOf some still shore; the herald thus relax'dHis alter'd features. Arrogance abash'dForeboded ruin from that mighty arm,In vigour brac'd by unexpected health.In act to speak, the hero stretch'd his hand.To fear and impotent distress he seem'dExtending refuge like a poplar tall,Whose grateful branches cool the green descentTo some pellucid fountain, where his courseTh' o'erweary'd passenger suspends to slakeHis eager thirst beneath such friendly shade.Bent to provoke the tyrant, and misleadHis rashness, thus Themistocles—his lookTranspierc'd the humbled herald while he spake:Begone, base Greek, from Chalcis. In her nameDefiance bear to Demonax, whose headShall on the gate of Oreus be affix'd;Thine to some trafficker in slaves be sold.To Oreus back th' astonish'd herald flies,On whose report his impious lord incens'dBlasphemes the gods. The Furies he invokes,To them, a human sacrifice, devotesHis first Chalcidian captives. From his hostTwo chosen myriads on the plain he pours.Brave Mindarus, by duty to his kingCompell'd to service which his sword abhors,Ariobarzanes, second in command,Barbarian homicide, whose joy is blood,
The sev'n Geraestians sworn to deeds of hell,With Lamachus, of foul mishapen frame,Attend the tyrant, spreading to rude stormsHis banner fell. So Satan from the northOf heav'n, his region once, with Moloc grim,Beëlzebub and Nisroc, led the hostOf impious angels, all the destin'd preyOf Tartarus. Meanwhile th' Athenian satSerene in Chalcis; his auxiliar bandsSuccessively arriv'd. Eretria sentTwelve hundred spears; Carystus doubled those;Beneath her standard Amarynthus rang'dEudora's vassals; Styra cas'd in steelFive hundred warriors tried; seven hundred moreGeraestus; Chalcis from her loins suppliedFour thousand youths, Nearchus was their chief.Th' Athenian's care had trac'd the region round.A level champaign tow'rds septentrion skies
Extends; its western border is the frith,Whose shore is bold, and press'd by waters deep.A line of anchor'd vessels, which o'erlookThe land, the chief disposes here; whose crewsWere menials, train'd to missile weapons light.Full opposite, and cross the plain, he mark'dA quarry, parent of the domes and tow'rs,Exalting Chalcis o'er Euboean towns.The subterranean passages by allInscrutable, but lab'ring hinds, who cleaveEarth's marble womb, he garrisons with bandsFrom that rough breed, supported by a forceOf heavy-mail'd Chalcideans, left in chargeTo bold Nearchus. So the watchful beesWithin their hive lie dangerous on guardAgainst invasion of their precious stores,Their industry and state. By morn the careOf active scouts proclaims the adverse hostNot far, though yet unseen. The trumpet sounds
To fight; Eudora mounts her car, and wieldsThe arms of Dian. Through the spacious streets,Where under ensigns of their sev'ral statesThe warriors blaze in steel, from band to bandShe, by her prompter well-instructed, tow'rsLike new-born Pallas from the head of Jove.Her voice exhorts, her sentiments inspire,Her majesty commands them; all are fir'd,All, but Timoxenus. With armed filesIn safe reserve, though destin'd to remainBehind the walls, he dreads th' important day.His gen'rous daughter, whose distemper'd mindEudora's converse had begun to calm,Not so debas'd her thoughts; her country's causeShe felt; heroic talents she admir'd;Him, who possess'd them all, her heart recall'd,Though with abated passion. All his taleOf Salamis, the stratagem deriv'dFrom conjugal affection, from the sight
Of forms belov'd to animate the brave,Recurr'd; she summon'd to her languid bedThe most distinguish'd matrons, them besoughtTo mount the walls, and overlook the fight,In all its terrors. Imitate, she said,The Attic dames, that Chalcis may partakeOf Attic glory. They approving went.O mortals, born to err, when most you smartWith self-reproach on guilty passion's wound,Attempt one act of virtue! then your breastsWill, like Acanthè's now, enjoy a calmIn supplication thus her wonder breaks:Ye lights, who, shining on my darkness, deignTo lift the veil of error from my eyes,Protecting pow'rs, accept Acanthè's pray'rFor this her native city, for a sireToo kind, for great Themistocles, who draws
The sword of Justice—Now with purer lipsI sound his name—And, O illustrious dame!Of all Athenian excellence the flow'r,Bless'd in a hero's love, the precious giftOf hymeneal Juno, couldst thou knowWhat I have suffer'd by an envious flame,What still I suffer, while remorse awakesA thought of thee, thy gen'rous soul would meltIn pity, ev'n forgiveness, when I vowTo ev'ry chaste divinity invok'd,That I will see Themistocles no more.This victory accomplish'd, renders backHer virtue late a captive, which recallsAffections pure, and sanctity of mind,Still thoughts, and hope, restorative of peace.But on a diff'rent victory intentThemistocles within Chalcidic walls
Contains his ready host; nor means to throwThe portals open, nor display the faceOf battle, till the enemies in sightYield full advantage in his choice of time.So in his deep concealment of green reedsOn Ganges' margin, or the flaggy strandOf Niger's flood, from Aethiopia roll'd,The alligator vigilant maintainsHis fraudful ambush, that unwary stepsMay bring the prey to his voracious jaws.End of the Sixteenth Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the SEVENTEENTH.SICINUS, long by unpropitious windsLock'd in Geraestus, to their fickle breath,Half-adverse still, impatient spread the sail.Six revolutions of the sun he spentTo gain Phaleron. To his lord's abodeHe swiftly pass'd, when chance his wond'ring eyesOn Aristides fix'd. An open spaceReveal'd the hero, issuing sage commands.Th' omnipotent artificer of worldsFrom chaos seem'd with delegated pow'r
To have entrusted that selected man.From ashes, lo! a city new ascends,One winter's indefatigable toilOf citizens, whose spirit unsubdu'dSubdues calamity. Each visage wearsA cheerful hue, yet solemn. Through the streetsSuccessive numbers from adjacent fieldsDrive odorif'rous loads of plants and flow'rs,Which please the manes. Amaranth and rose,Fresh parsley, myrtle, and whate'er the sun,Now not remote from Aries in his course,Call'd from the quick and vegetating wombOf nature green or florid, from their seatsOf growth are borne for pious hands to weaveIn fun'ral chaplets. From the Grecian states,To honour Athens, their deputed chiefs,Cleander foremost, throng the public place;Whence Aristides with advancing speedSalutes Sicinus: Welcome is thy face,
Good man, thou know'st; from Athens long estrang'd,Now doubly welcome. In thy looks I readImportant news. Retiring from the crowd,Swift in discourse, but full, Sicinus ranThrough all the feries of his lord's exploits,Which drew this question: Has thy patron oughtTo ask of Aristides? Silent bow'dSicinus. Smiling then, the chief pursu'd:Do thou attend the ceremonial pompOf obsequies to morrow; when the slainAt Salamis receive their just rewardFrom us, survivors by their glorious fall.I have detain'd thee from Timothea long,The first entitled to thy grateful news.Now to that matron, whom beyond himselfHe priz'd, Sicinus hastens. At her loom
He finds her placid o'er a web, whose glowOf colours rivall'd Iris. where intentShe wove th' atchievements of her lord. Her skillHad just portray'd Sandauce in the armsOf Artamanes, when her children's doomCongeal'd her breast. Themistocles in lookExpresses all that subtlety humane,Which cozen'd superstition of her prey;His godlike figure dignifies the work.Two boys, two lovely little maids, surroundTh' illustrious artist, while their eyes pursueTheir mother's flying fingers in delightAttentive. But their tutor once in view,From absence long regretted, light with joyTo him they bound. Sicinus melts in tearsOf soft affection. They around him liftTheir gratulating voices, on his neckCling, and contend for kisses from those lipsApprov'd in kindness; as a flutt'ring brood
With chirping fondness, nature's sweetest note,Inclose their feather'd parent, who attunesHer tender pipe, and spreads endearing plumes.Sicinus, cries Timothea, thou dost bringAuspicious tidings; from my hero IExpect no less. Unaided by the state,A private man, like Hercules he went,In his own pow'rs confiding, and secure.Sit down, thou witness of my husband's worth,Thyself a proof of his discerning choiceIn thee, good man, by me and mine rever'd,Discreet and faithful. No, Sicinus spake,Thou art that proof, most faithful, most discreet,Most excellent of women. Come, she said,Suppress my praises; let me hear of none,But his; and copious let thy story flow.Glad through his whole heroic theme the sage,By time to Attic eloquence inur'd,
Expatiates large; where loftiness of planSustain'd by counsel, with exhaustless artPursu'd, now brought to valour's final proof,Must end in sure success. His lord's commandsObserving strict, Acanthè's precious worth,In talents, form and manners, he describes;How she the aid of Chalcis had procur'd,Her favour how Themistocles had won.If he pursue to victory his plan,Timothea said, and borrow from her handThe means of glory, and the gen'ral good,Tell him, that I can imitate with joyAndromachè, who foster'd on her breastHer Hector's offspring by a stol'n embrace.Not such thy lot, sole mistress of a formMatch'd by perfection of the mind alone,Sicinus cheerful answer'd. I attest
To this my firm belief th' all-ruling sire,Let Horomazes be his name, or Jove.Thou giv'st me transport—Thou hast leave to smile,My good Sicinus, she replies—But heav'nI too attest, that transport I conceiveLess for my own, than fair Acanthè's sake.So amiably endow'd, so clear in fame,Her purity resigning, she, alas!Had prov'd the only suff'rer. Woman fall'n,The more illustrious once, the more disgrac'd,Ne'er can resume her lustre. Laurels hideA hero's wanton lapse. The Greeks would blessThe guile which serves them, but to endless shameThe gen'rous auth'ress of that service doom.Thou said'st, my husband from Cleander's swordSolicits help; Cleander is my guestWith Ariphilia; ready in this port
His squadron lies; he plough'd the seas in questOf earliest action for the common cause.Come, they are waiting for the night's repast.She rose; Sicinus follow'd, and renew'dIn Ariphilia's and Cleander's earThe wondrous narrative, but cautious veilsAcanthè's love. Timothea's looks approv'd.He then concluded: Thus, to battle rous'd,The force of half Euboea cas'd in steelAgainst the tyrant Demonax I left;But in the chace of that devouring wolfOn thee relies Themistocles for help,Undaunted chief of Troezen. He replies:Should I withhold it, by th' immortal gods,The titles both of soldier and of friendWere mine no longer. Ariphilia then,
Sweet as a vernal flow'r in early prime,A Grace in manner, Hebè in her form:Say, gentle sage, of Delphi's rev'rend priest,Of Haliartus, and Oïleus' son,Kind guests of mine, no tidings dost thou bear?He answers: Them in Atalantè's isleThe turbulent Euripus yet confines;They soon, fair matron, to thy lord and mineWill add their strength and level from its baseThe tyrant's hold. Amid this converse sweetThe warrior-poet Aeschylus appears,A grateful visitant to all. He spake:Fair dame, admit me, introducing menWho saw thy gallant consort yester mornErecting trophies; men themselves renown'd,Oïlean Medon, and Apollo's priest
Long lost, whom I, unknowing of their fate,Have clasp'd in transport, as Laertes' son,When he review'd his metamorphos'd friendsIn Circe's island to their pristine formsUprising by her charms. Timothea gladSalutes the ent'ring heroes, Medon knownBefore, Leonteus, Delphi's holy seerWith Artemisia's brother, strangers all,But of deportment to command regard.Then spake the Locrian: First of matrons, hail!On Salaminian sands we parted last.I have been long in Atalantè's isleSequester'd; but, determin'd to attendThe fun'ral honours which the morning paysTo brave Athenians slain, an hour sereneTo cross the strait Euripus I embrac'dFor Chalcis. There thy consort fresh I foundIn gather'd palms from Demonax o'erthrown
That day in battle. Hear the glorious tale,Which from Themistocles himself I learn'd.He, well-inform'd, the chiefs in either hostDistinctly told, their history, their names,Their birth and deeds, on Hyacinthus most,As most esteem'd, enlarg'd. That hapless youthWas husband to Cleora; daughter sheOf Demonax was poison'd by her sire.Survey this tablet, which before my sightThy hero took, with readiness of skillDelineating the fight. Shew this, he said,To my Timothea, friendly thou explain.This part is Chalcis, this a champaign wide;Here flows the sea, there winds a quarry dark.Conceive a river by impetuous floodsO'erswol'n, and spread irregular, and wild,Beyond its bounds; tumultuous thus the foesAt first appear'd. Expecting to surprise,Themselves surpris'd at unexpected bands,
Through open'd portals issuing to the plain,Are forc'd, dishearten'd by a toilsome march,To range their numbers for immediate fight.The wary son of Neocles suspendsTh' attack, till bursting drifts of southern cloudsBeat on the faces of his harrass'd foesA storm of blinding sleet; then rushes downIn three deep columns. Of th' Orēan lineThe right, which Mindarus conducting wheelsAlong the sea's flat margin, sore is gall'dBy unremitted show'rs from bows and slingsOn well-rang'd vessels. Lamachus commandsThe left. Nearchus from the quarry poursAn ambush'd force, and breaks the hostile flank.Compact of vet'rans, cull'd from ev'ry state,That wedge of war, whose bristly front display'dAthenian spears and Spartan mingling beams,(Themistocles the leader) slow but sureBears down the center. At a second breach
The line gives way to Cleon, at a thirdTo swift Carystians. Not a life is spar'dBy wrong'd, incens'd Eretrians, not a lifeBy Hyacinthus, boiling with revengeFor his Cleora; while her cruel sireExerts a desp'rate valour to reviveHope in an army spiritless by toil,By sudden onset broken, at the nameAnd sight of thy Themistocles abash'd.The rout is gen'ral. In the bloody chaceFive thousand slain the conquerors despoil.Thy husband, prudent in success, preservesTwo thousand heads, all Persian, to redeemEretrian captives from the tyrant's bonds.He, thus defeated, not subdu'd, retir'dTo Oreus. Pow'rful remnants of his hostHe, draws within her circuit; furnish'd wellFrom boundless treasure, threatens there to holdA firm defence, till, summon'd by the spring,
Mardonius quit Thessalia, and employThe whole confederated pow'r of Greece.That threat Themistocles will render vain,Exults Timothea; he unfinish'd leavesNo toil begun. Again the Locrian chief:Now my first duty is discharg'd; the nextTo Ariphilia from her guest is due.O soft in virtue, elegantly fair,Cleander's favour'd paranymph retainsThy hospitable kindness ever dear;Thine too, my gallant host, by Neptune bless'dIn his own priestess, and with brightest fameOn his own floods adorn'd. The pleasing hoursAll spend in mutual gratulation sweet,Till for the morn's solemnity they part.Below th' Aegalean mountain, where the kingOf humbled Asia on his golden throne
Was seated late, spectator of his shameAt Salamis, a level space extendsTo Neptune's border. Green Psittalia thereFull opposite exhibits, high and large,A new erected trophy. Twenty mastsAppear, the tallest of Phoenician pines,In circular position. Round their baseAre massive anchors, rudders, yards, and oars,Irregularly pil'd, with beaks of brass,And naval sculpture from Barbarian sterns,Stupendous by confusion. Crested helmsAbove, bright mail, habergeons scal'd in gold,And figur'd shields along the spiry woodUp to th' aerial heads in order wind,Tremendous emblems of gigantic Mars.Spears, bristling through the intervals, uprearTheir points obliquely; gilded staves projectEmbroider'd colours; darts and arrows hangIn glitt'ring clusters. On the topmost height
Th' imperial standard broad, from Asia won,Blaz'd in the sun, and floated in the wind.Of smooth Pentelic marble on the beach,Where flow'd the brine of Salamis, a tombInsculptur'd rose. Achievements of that dayWhen Asia's navy fell, in swelling formsFill'd on three sides the monument. The fourth,Unfinish'd, open'd to th' interior grave.Now, through Minerva's populace, who keptReligious silence, first white-vested maids,Who from the strand of Salamis had seenThe patriots slain, their sepulchre approachWith wreaths and garlands; then of chosen youthsA troop, whose valour had the fight surviv'd.The younger matrons, husbands ripe in age,Nor less in fame, succeed. Of either sexThe elders follow. Kindred of the deadCome next, their wives, their children. Urns, which hold
The sacred ashes, are in open carsDiscover'd. One close chariot is reserv'dFor them, whose bodies fate from search conceal'd.Last Aristides, in his civil robe,Attracts the gazing multitude; his wheels,Myronides, Xanthippus, Cimon great,Aminias, Aeschylus, and ev'ry chiefFor prowess known attend. Around the tombAre plac'd the children; roses in the budEntwine their brows; their little grasp upholdsGreen sprigs of myrtle; well instructed, allRefrain from weeping o'er paternal dust,Deposited by glory in the grave.A high tribunal Aristides mounts;Near him, on ev'ry side, are seats assign'dTo strangers held in honour. Medon there,Leonteus, Timon, and the brother knownOf Caria's queen, Cleander, numbers moreFrom states ennobled in their names are seen.
The godlike man uprises; on the tombHis eyes he fixes first; their lustre mildHe then diffuses o'er th' assembly vast,Where not a tongue is heard, nor gesture seen.So through unclouded skies the argent lampOf Dian visits with her light benignA surface broad of water, where no breezeExcites a swell, nor sighs among the reeds.Your fathers, wise and lib'ral, he began,Appointed public obsequies to allWho die in battle for the public good,Ye men of Athens. Not a groan, or tearMust violate their ashes. These have gain'dWhat all should envy; these, by virtuous death,The height of human excellence have reach'd,Have found the surest path to endless joyWith demigods and heroes in those fields,Which tyrants ne'er can enter to molest
The blissful region; but are far remov'dTo realms of horror, and from righteous JoveEndure the pains they merit from mankind.There, if retaining, as they surely must,The memory of things belov'd on earth,It will enhance their happiness to knowTheir offspring cherish'd, and their wives rever'dBy grateful Athens, whom their glorious fallExalts, whose daughters they preserv'd from shame,Whose sons from bonds. This bliss benignant Jove,Who loves the patriot, never can withholdFrom them, who little would deserve that name,Unless those sweetest charities they feel,Paternal cares, and conjugal esteem,The props of public and domestic weal.Them to defend, Athenians, to maintainInviolate your altars, tombs and laws,Let contemplation of the present ritesGive principle new strength. Behold a foe,
Who hath profan'd your ancestors in dust.Lo! on a cross Leonidas affix'd,His patriot bones expos'd to bleaching windsBy that Barbarian, Xerxes. Kings alone,Obtuse of mind, illiberal, the brutesOf human nature, can devise and actBarbarities like these. But such a foeLeagues Heav'n against him. Nemesis will joinWith Grecian Mars, and all her furies plantHis foot on Asia's boundaries, to shakeAn impious tyrant on his native throne.Then of the patriot dead, whose swords prepar'dYour way to glory, and achiev'd their own,This recent tomb, when dress'd in eastern spoils,Will best delight their manes, and proclaimTo Gods and men your gratitude and arms.He paus'd. Aegaleos echo'd to the soundOf acclamation; Salamis reply'd.
But as the sun, when casual clouds beforeHis intercepted light have pass'd away,Renews his splendour, so the righteous manIn eloquence and counsel thus againBreaks forth: Xanthippus, in the gales of spring,To brave the coast Barbaric you decree;While, on Boeotia's plains, your phalanx meetsMardonian ranks. Now hear of wond'rous actsTo you unknown, unpromis'd, just perform'dBy an Athenian. Winter hath not sleptInactive; your Themistocles hath rous'dThat sluggish season by the clang of war;A force creating by his matchless art,He hath o'erthrown fierce Demonax, and coop'dWithin his fort. Delib'rate swift, my friends,How to assist your hero; Justice callsOn ev'ry tongue ingenuous so to styleThemistocles; who wants but slender help.Your skill, Athenians, in surmounting walls
Excels in Greece. Select experienc'd bands;An instantaneous effort may o'erwhelmBeneath the ruins of his last retreatEuboea's scourge, whose prevalence might shutThat granary of Athens, and transferTo Asia's num'rous camp your needful stores.All in applauding admiration hearDisinterested virtue, which exaltsA rival's merit. But thy gen'rous breast,To all superior in sensation highDivine Timothea, entertains a warmthOf grateful rapture in thy lord's behalf,Which shines confess'd. Sicinus, at her side,Condemns his lord, who nothing would requestOf Aristides; him, who grants unask'd,His soul adores. Aminias, rising, spake;A fearless warrior, brother to the bard,Like him sincere, less polish'd, learn'd and wise,By right intention more than conduct sway'd:Who can for all deliberate so well,As Aristides singly? Let us fight;But with sole pow'r of counsel and command,Throughout this war's duration, by a lawInvest him uncontrollable. Up startsThe interrupting patriot, nor permitsThe people's confidence in him to growIn wild excess: Ne'er yet th' almighty sireCreated man of purity to holdA trust like this. Athenians, mark my words;I am your legal military chief;If your immediate safety should requireAn use of pow'r, unwarranted by laws,I will exert it, not accept as law;The censure or acquittal of my actWith you shall rest. At present I advise,That from Phaleron Aeschylus transportTwo thousand skilful vet'rans. Him the seedOf Neocles approves; not less in arms
Than arts excelling, him your warriors prize.Them, ere two monthly periods of the sun,You cannot want. Thick verdure must investThe meadows, earth her foodful stores mature,Before Mardonius can his numbers leadFrom Thessaly remote. Ere then, my friends,Themistocles will conquer, and erectCecropia's standard on Orēan walls;Your timely aid he timely will restoreTo fill the army of united Greece.The gen'ral voice assents, and all retire,While to her home Timothea brings her guests.To her Sicinus prudent: Not an hour,Till I rejoin thy consort, should be lost.She then: Most faithful, from my arm receiveThis bracelet rich in gems, Barbaric spoil;Bear this to Chalcis, to Acanthè give;Say, how I prize her elevated mind,
Enabling my Themistocles to quellThe hateful breed of tyrants. Further say,The man engaging her connubial handI should esteem the favourite of gods.Stay; Haliartus shall the present bear.Thou to my lord a messenger of loveShalt go, Sicinus; words to thee I leave;My heart thou know'st. One fervent wish impart,That he in private, as in public ties,With Aristides may at last unite.So spake the first of women. Troezen's chiefSubjoin'd: Sicinus, wait till morn; embarkWith these our friends of Atalantè's isleAboard my squadron; soon will southern galesMy succour waft, and jointly we proclaimBrave Aeschylus to follow. Let us greetHim, who our valour into action callsFor ev'ry chief to envy; him to clasp
My bosom pants, a hero, who surmountsThe sloth of winter while so many braveHang up their weapons. Ariphilia heard,Sat mute and sad. To her Timothea thus:We, who are wives of soldiers, will remainTogether, cheerful watch for tidings dearOf their achievements, and rejoice at home.End of the Seventeenth Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the EIGHTEENTH.THREE days transport Cleander and his friends;Timoxenus admits such welcome guests,Who bring new succours. From Chalcidic wallsTh' Athenian chief was absent. With a paceUnstable yet, a calm, but languid mien,To grace her father's board Acanthè leavesHer chamber; pale, but fragrant as the rose,Which bears the hue of lilies, she descends.Her soon the Carian, mindful of his charge,Thus with Timothea's salutation greets:A costly bracelet, from her beauteous armTh' espous'd of great Themistocles unclasp'dOn my departure, and in words like these,Of gracious tone, deliver'd to my care:"Bear this to Chalcis, to Acanthè give;"Say how I prize her elevated mind,"Enabling my Themistocles to quell"The hateful breed of tyrants. Further say,"The man engaging her connubial hand"I should esteem the favourite of gods."Timoxenus is pleas'd; Acanthè's cheeksA burning blush of perturbation feel.Not soon recov'ring from a start of thoughtAt the first mention of Timothea's name,She took, she kiss'd the present, and disguis'dHer conscious trouble under busy careTo fix the bracelet in its lovely seat.The guests are plac'd around; her presence charmsThe banquet. Though the lustre of her eyesGrief had eclips'd and sickness, though her mouthHad lost the ruby tinct and pleasing flow,By melancholy silence long confin'd,Her gestures speak the graces of her soul.Troezene's captain, lively as the larkWhose trill preludes to nature's various voice,Begins discourse: Perhaps, accomplish'd fair,Thou dost not know the messenger, who broughtTimothea's present, Haliartus styl'd;He is deriv'd from Lygdamis, a name,Ionia boasts. His daughter, Caria's queen,Fam'd Artemisia, heroine of Mars,Calls Haliartus brother; but from GreeceCould never alienate his truth. His swordFrom violation, in his first essayAgainst Barbarian multitudes, preserv'd
Bright Amarantha, consort to the kingOf Macedon, more noble in her sire,Who sits beside thee, Timon, Delphi's priest.Then Medon: How unwilling do I checkOur social converse. Generous host, no tongueCan duly praise thy hospitable roof;Yet we must leave its pleasures; Time forbidsOur longer stay. Two thousand Locrian spears,Three hundred Delphians Atalantè holds;Them Aeschylus arriving will expectTo find in Chalcis. Gladly shall I hail,Timoxenus rejoins, your quick return,To guard these walls. Themistocles is march'dTo conquer Aegae, rather to redeemHer state aggriev'd, which courts his guardian hand.Sicinus here: Illustrious men, farewell;In Aegae soon Themistocles shall knowOf your arrival. Instant he began,All night pursu'd his course, and saw the morn
Shine on that city yielded to his lord.To him Sicinus counts the pow'rful aidsExpected, large of Aristides speaks,Large of Timothea; in a rapt'rous styleDwells on her wish for amity to bindThe two Cecropian heroes. Glad repliesThemistocles: On every new eventShe rises lovelier, more endear'd; her worthShall meliorate her husband. I obey,Content on this wide universe to seeMyself the second, Aristides first;For still he tow'rs above me. Didst thou say,Cleander, Medon, were already come,That Aeschylus was coming? All their forceI want, Sicinus; listen to my tale.Last night an ancient personage, unknown,In length of beard most awful, not unlikeTisander, ask'd an audience, and obtain'd
My private ear. Themistocles, he said,If I deliver tidings, which importThy present safety, and thy future weal,I shall exact thy promise in the nameOf all the gods and goddesses to waveEnquiry, whence I come, or who I am.First know, that Mindarus, the Persian chiefIn Oreus, newly for Thessalia's coastEmbark'd, whose neighb'ring Pagasaean capeLooks on Euboea. He this day return'd,And reinforcement from Mardonius brought,Ten thousand spears. Thessalia hath supply'dThree thousand more. An army huge defendsTh' Orēan circuit. Further be inform'dThat sev'n Geraestian homicides are swornTo thy destruction. By their secret wilesThe house of rich Timoxenus was fir'd;Them in the field hereafter, all combin'dAgainst thy head, their sable arms will shew;
The hideous impress on their shields is death.Farewell, thou hero; if my parting stepThou trace, farewell for ever; else be sureAgain to see me in thy greatest need.In mystery, Sicinus, not of heav'n,But human art, immers'd is some event,Which mocks my utmost fathom; but my courseIs plain. In fruitless search I waste no thought,Who, as my servant, smiling fortune use,Nor yet am hers, Sicinus, when she frowns.Now mark: One passage winds among the hillsEncircling Oreus. When the vanquish'd foeHer bulwarks sought for shelter, I detach'dEretrian Cleon, Hyacinthus brave,And with Carystian bands Nicanor staid,Who unoppos'd the strong defile secur'd;There shall my banner, strengthen'd by the youthOf Aegae, soon be planted; there shall wait,
Till each auxiliar, thou hast nam'd, arrive,Then pour on Demonax the storm of war.Let Troezen's squadron and th' Athenian rideBefore his port, Cleander have the charge.Speed back to Chalcis; publish these resolves.They part. Not long Themistocles delay'dTo gain the mountains; nor three days were pass'dWhen brave Nearchus, Haliartus bold,Th' illustrious brothers of Oïlean race,Great Aeschylus and Timon, with their bandsArriv'd, and join'd him at the strong defileWhich now contain'd his whole collected force.Thence he descended on a morning fair,First of that month, which frequent sees the sunThrough vernal show'rs, distill'd from tepid clouds,Diffuse prolific beams o'er moisten'd earthTo dress her lap, exuberant and fresh,With flow'rs and verdure. Terrible the bandsSucceeding bands expatiate o'er the fields.
So when an earthquake rives a mountain's side,Where stagnant water, gather'd and confin'dWithin a deep vacuity of rock,For centuries hath slept, releas'd, the floodsIn roaring cataracts impetuous fall;They roll before them shepherds and their flocks,Herds and their keepers; cottage, fold and stall,Promiscuous ruins floating on the stream,Are borne to plains remote. Now Oreus liftsHer stately tow'rs in sight. Three myriads arm'dBefore the walls hath Demonax arrang'dIn proud defiance. So, at first o'erthrown,Antaeus huge, uprising in his mightFresh and redoubled by his parent earth,Return'd to combat with Alcmena's seed.Wide stretch'd th' Orēan van; the wary sonOf Neocles to equal that extentSpread his inferiour number. By a front
Not depth of line the tyrant he deceiv'd;But of Athenian veterans he form'dA square battalion, which the martial bardRang'd on the sea-beat verge; the other wingIs Medon's charge, where thirty shields in fileCompose the Locrian column. Ere the wordIs giv'n for onset, thus his wonted guardThemistocles addresses: If a troopIn sable cuirass, and with shields impress'dBy death's grim figure, at my head should aim,Let them assail me; be it then your care,Postponing other duty, to surround,To seize and bear them captives from the fight.He march'd; himself the cent'ral phalanx led;The floating crimson of his plumage known,Minerva's bird his crest, whose terrors shookThe bloody field of Chalcis, soon proclaimThemistocles. Now targets clash with shields;
Barbarian sabres with Cecropian swords,Euboean spears with spears in sudden shock,Bellona mingles. Medon first o'erthrewThessalia's line, his temp'rate mind was stungBy indignation; Timon bath'd his lanceIn their perfidious blood; Leonteus gor'dTheir dissipated ranks. A chosen troopTo their assistance Lamachus advanc'd;Him Haliartus met; his sinewy arm,Which could have quell'd Lycaon, first of wolves,The Erymanthian, or Aetolian boar,Smote to the ground the miscreant's bulk deform'd,Whose band, recoiling, leave the victor spaceTo drag him captive. Rout and carnage sweepThat shatter'd wing before th' Oïlean swords;Not with less vigour Aeschylus o'erturn'dThe other. Mindarus in vain oppos'dUndaunted efforts. Pallas seem'd to fireHer own Athenians; Neptune, in the shape
Of Aeschylus, seem'd landed from his conchTo war, as once on Troy's Sigaean strand;Or to have arm'd the warrior-poet's graspWith that strong weapon, which can rock the earth.Not in the center suddenly prevail'dThemistocles; the sev'n Geraestians, leagu'dBy hell, combining their assassin pointsAgainst the hero, for a while delay'dHis progress; firmly their united blowsHis shield receiv'd. So Hercules endur'dThe sev'nfold stroke of Hydra; but the zealOf Iolaüs to assist that godIn his tremendous labour, was surpass'dBy each Athenian, each Laconian guard,Who never left Themistocles. They watch'dThe fav'ring moment; with a hundred spearsThey hedg'd the traitors round, forbade escape,Clasp'd and convey'd them living from the field.Still Demonax resists; while near him tow'rsAriobarzanes, moving rock of warIn weight and stature. Of Euboeans, forc'dBy savage pow'r to battle, numbers low'rSurrend'ring banners, some to Cleon, someTo humble Styra's well-conducted sword,And thine, sad youth, a while by glory taughtTo strive with anguish, and suspend despair,Cleora's husband. Mindarus appears,Who warns the tyrant timely to retreat,Ere quite envelop'd by the wheeling filesOf Aeschylus and Medon. Lo! in front,More dang'rous still, amid selected ranks,Themistocles. The monster gnash'd his teeth;His impious voice, with execrations hoarse,Assail'd the heav'nly thrones; his buckler firmHe grasp'd, receding to th' Orēan wall;Where, under vaulted sheets of missive armsWhirl'd on his fierce pursuers, through the gates
He rush'd to shelter. Thus a mighty boar,Of Calydonian strength, long held at bay,The hunter's point evading, and the fangsOf staunchest hounds, with undiminish'd ireRed in his eyes, and foaming from his jaws,Impetuous plunges in accustom'd woods.Th' Athenian chief, who sees th' incessant stormsOf darts and arrows from the rampart's height,Retreats; but swift his numbers, now enlarg'dBy yielding thousands of Euboean race,Distributes round th' invested town to guardEach avenue and station. From the seaCleander threatens. In his evening tentThe gen'ral views the captives; frowns condemnThe sev'n Geraestians to their former chains.The hero smiles on Lamachus, the prizeOf Haliartus, and familiar thus:Again, my Tyrian trafficker in slaves,I greet thee: Son of Lygdamis, what praiseTo thy distinguish'd efforts is not due?This precious head to my disposal yield.He then proceeds to Lamachus apart:Now take thy freedom, villain; to my useSee thou employ it, else expect to die.Your land, remember, and your sea are mine;Soon on the head of Demonax this armShall dash yon bulwarks; what I speak is fate.Thou hast thy option, go. Sicinus, hear;This man is free; conduct him through the camp.Now from his friends sequester'd, on a couch,Which never care disturbs, he slept till dawn,When, rous'd by heralds from the town, againThe leaders he conven'd. Before them cameArbactus, fierce Barbarian, who began:Themistocles of Athens, in the nameOf Mindarus the Persian, I defyThy arm to combat in the listed field;The same defiance to thy boldest chiefsAriobarzanes sends. If you prevail,The royal host shall quit Euboea's isle,Which shall submit to Xerxes if you fall.Up Hyacinthus, Haliartus, startIndignant. First the young Carystian spake:Are they so gross in ignorance to hope,Themistocles will stoop to single fightWith twice-o'erthrown Barbarians, who, unsafeBehind a rampart, tremble at his pow'r?But if the Persian Mindarus would tryA Grecian's single valour, O permit,Themistocles, thy soldier to assertThe Grecian fame. The friend of Medon next:The same permission I implore, O chief,Invincible thyself; that all this hostMay witness my fidelity to Greece.Themistocles subjoins: Barbarian, go,Provide thy champions; ours thou seest prepar'dFor honour, not decision of the doomReserv'd for Demonax; whose final lotLies in my breast alone. The herald backTo Oreus speeds. The prudent chief pursues:My Hyacinthus, all thy wrongs I feel;But, if resentment can afford the graceI ask thee, lend to policy thy arm:Take Mindarus thy captive. From thy proofsOf might and firmness, Haliartus brave,My wish is lifted high in hope to seeAriobarzanes gasping at thy feet.He rises. Straight embattled on the plain,His army shews a formidable gleamTo Demonax. Still num'rous for defenceBarbarian warriors, and Thessalian, throngThe battlements of Oreus. Through the gates,In solemn pace and slow, a herald trainPrecede their champions. Heralds from the campProduce th' illustrious Haliartus cladIn richest arms, the gift of Caria's queen;A twig of flend'rest laurel, twisted roundA shepherd's crook, in portraiture adorn'dHis modest buckler. Grim his foe advanc'dIn mail blood-colour'd, with a targe of gold,Ariobarzanes. Hyacinthus nextAppears in tried habiliments of war,Which on his dearest patron Mars had seenIn Marathonian fields. A plumage black,Denoting grief, he carries; on his shieldA female image, and the form of Death,
Who blasts her graces. Mindarus approach'dIn armour studded bright with orient gems;His buckler too a shape of beauty pale,Stretch'd on a fun'ral pyre, exhibits sad;Of pearl her limbs, of rubies were the flames.Ere they engage, the Persian warrior thus:Since my encounter, whether through disdainOr policy I know not, is refus'dBy your commander, not through fear I know,Do thou in courtesy disclose thy name,Thy rank in Grecian armies. May'st thou proveIn lustre such as Mindarus would chuseTo be th' opponent of a satrap's arm.Then tremble, satrap, at my name, the nameOf Hyacinthus, fierce the youth returns;Cleora's husband, whom thy barb'rous loveHath wrong'd, whom hell-born Demonax hath damn'd
To ever-during torment, shakes this lance,By vengeance pointed and invet'rate hate.Young man, rejoins the Persian, on thy griefI drop a pitying tear, while thou dost wrongMe clear of wrong to thee. No barb'rous loveWas mine; unconscious of your nuptial tie,Till she confess'd it to her savage sire,My flame was holy; not a thought impureTo violate a right could taint my breast.But that I lov'd her, Hyacinthus, sureHe, who her dear perfections knew so well,Must wave his wonder; that her fate o'erwhelmsMy spirit, never to revive, I feel;That my disastrous passion caus'd her doom,Blame both our fortunes, not my guiltless heart.If yet thy anguish can a moment lookCompassionate on me—but I forgiveUnjust reproaches from a grief like thine,
Which should, which must exceed my own, my ownExceeding after thine all other woe.Now Hyacinthus melted, but observ'd,That during this sad interview the spearOf Haliartus at his feet had laidAriobarzanes dead. Heart-stung by shameAt his inaction, with so many chiefs,With such an army, and the godlike sonOf Neocles spectators, he beginsThe fight, but recollects that friend's request.The Persian more effeminate despondsAt past defeats, and present grief renew'd,Whose weight, though lighter, he less firmly bore,Than did the hardy Greek his heavier shareOf woe. Yet fearless he maintains the strifeWith native force devoid of gymnic skill,In which confiding Hyacinthus oftInverts his spear, and levels bloodless strokes,
Still vigilant to ward the hostile point,Oft o'er his buckler glancing, though impell'dBy active strength. At last a pond'rous blowFull on the Persian's front descends; a groanIs heard throughout the rampart as he falls;The groan redoubles, as the victor bearsThat leader captive to th' investing camp.To his own tent Themistocles admitsThe Persian's batter'd, but unwounded limbs;He praises Hyacinthus; he consolesThe noble foe, commends to healing rest,And at returning morn salutes him thus:If thee unransom'd, Mindarus, I sendTo Oreus, canst thou pity her estateCurs'd in a monster? Canst thou feel the woundOf thy own glory longer to supportThe worst of men, excluded by his crimes
From heav'n's protection, and the laws of faith?Wilt thou, to spare whole rivulets of bloodGreek and Barbarian, render to my armsThe town, and thus procure thyself a nameTo live for ever, by a righteous act,Delighting gods and mortals? Thee my shipsShall land in safety on thy native shore;The king will praise thee for his army sav'd,Which shall partake my clemency. RejectAll hope, good Persian, to withstand my arm;I am Themistocles. The satrap startsFrom languor thus: Athenian, I confessThy greatness, thy ascendency have felt;But will endure, whate'er a victor's pow'rInflicts on captives, rather than polluteMy loyal faith to Xerxes; from my kingI took my charge, and never will betray.The crimes of Demonax I know; myselfHave prov'd their horrors in Cleora's fate,
I lov'd, ador'd her excellence; her threadHis impious rage dissever'd; on her tombMy tears have daily flow'd. Retain me stillThy captive, never to revisit moreHer father's hateful mansion. Heav'n permit,By thy vindictive arm, but heav'n forbid,That ever by disloyalty of mine,Th' infernal author of her death may fall.The barbarism of loyalty, which bindsMen to a monarch, but the monarch leavesFree to his lusts, his cruelty and rage,Th' enlighten'd Greek despis'd, yet now deplor'dIn one by nature gifted to deserveA better lot from heav'n. Not less awareOf democratic jealousy, which hurlsFrom fortune's summit heroes to the dust,He press'd no further, cautious not to woundA gallant mind, whose friendship won he meant
To use in wants, such fortune might create.He leaves Sicinus near him; while his careExhausts the light in traversing the campTo view the works. His evening orders holdEach band in arms; while anxious in his tentHe sits deep-musing, whether to attemptThe town that night by storm, or patient waitFor some event less bloody, casual boonOf time and fortune. Wasteful is delay,But precious too his soldiers; such brave livesThe full completion of his vast designRequires. Thus, dubious, till the second watchThroughout the camp is toll'd, and clouded heav'nDrops down her sable veil, he sits; when lo!Before him stands his monitor unknown,The venerable figure, which he sawAt Aegae. Staid Sicinus is the guide,Who swift retires, but watches faithful nigh.Themistocles, the stranger solemn spake;Thee I have trusted, thou hast trusted me,Nor either hath repented. Who I am,Now learn. By friendship's sacred ties, by bloodTo thy best friend Eudora I am bound,Elephenor am call'd, pontific seerOf Jupiter in Oreus. Timely warn'dBy her most urgent mandate to reposeAll confidence in thee, and lend my aid,Nor less admonish'd by Tisander sage,I help'd thee first with counsel; now I bringEffectual succour. Demonax, though foil'd,Hath still a pow'rful remnant of his hostTo man his walls, and desp'rate will defend.Select two thousand spears; avoid delay;A secret passage, known to holy stepsAlone, o'er town and tyrant will completeThy bloodless conquest. Swift the Attic chief:O father! sacred in my ear the soundOf good Tisander's, great Eudora's names;Thy former warnings I have prov'd sincereTo merit gratitude and trust. He callsSicinus, bids him summon all the chiefsOf Locris and Carystus; they appear.To Hyacinthus and Nicanor thenThemistocles: Attend with all your bandsThis rev'rend guide; intelligence transmitAs you advance. His orders are perform'd.Next he exhorts th' Oilean brethren thus,Nor passes favour'd Haliartus by:You with your Locrians follow to supportThese friends, lest ambush and deception lurkBeneath a promise of assur'd success.This said, himself forth issues to prepareThe gen'ral host for action, ev'n that night,
If fair occasion summons, when he meetsTroezene's leader. Is Cleander here,Themistocles began? Momentous sure,The cause which sends thee from thy naval charge.To him Cleander: Anchor'd as I lay,A slender skiff, when darkness first prevail'd,Approach'd my galley. To an earnest suitFor conference I listen'd, and receiv'dOn board a man of Oreus, all in limbsDeform'd, in lineaments all rude, whose nameIs Lamachus. To render up this nightA sep'rate fort he proffers, which commandsThe town and harbour, if thy faith be pledg'dHim and Thessalia's garrison to landSafe on her neighb'ring coast. Thy will to learnI come, he waits. His proffer I accept,Rejoins th' alert Athenian, and the doom,I had prepar'd for those degen'rate Greeks,
Postpone. Cleander to his station flies.Serene th' Athenian in array containsHis army cool, with expectation mute.So, in deceitful quiet oft the mainBefore the glazing light of Dian spreadsA mirrour smooth; the ruler of the windsAnon from troubled clouds, and ocean's godFrom his tempestuous chariot, give the signFor wild commotion; then the surging brineAssails the loftiest tops of reeling masts,Foams on the rocks, and deluges the beach.End of the Eighteenth Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the NINETEENTH.THE morning breaks; Nicanor sudden greetsThe gen'ral; welcome tidings in these wordsHe utters loud: The citadel is won,The tyrant slaughter'd. With our sacred guideA rugged, winding track, in brambles hid,Half up a crag we climb'd; there, stooping low,A narrow cleft we enter'd; mazy stillWe trod through dusky bowels of a rock,While our conductor gather'd, as he stepp'd,
A clue, which careful in his hand he coil'd.Our spears we trail'd; each soldier held the skirtOf his preceding comrade. We attain'dAn iron wicket, where the ending lineWas fasten'd; thence a long and steep ascentWas hewn in steps; suspended on the sides,Bright rows of tapers cheer'd our eyes with light.We reach'd the top; there lifting o'er his headA staff, against two horizontal valvesOur leader smote, which open'd at the sound.Behind me Hyacinthus on the rockSunk sudden down, pronouncing in his fallCleora; I on Hyacinthus call'd.Is this Cleora's husband? cried the priest;Descend, my Pamphila, my wife, descend.She came, a rev'rend priestess; tender bothWith me assisting plac'd my speechless friend
Within a cleft by me unmark'd before,Which seem'd a passage to some devious cell.Me by the hand Elephenor remov'dPrecipitate; a grating door of brassClos'd on my parting steps. Ascend, he said,Make no enquiry; but remain assur'd,His absence now is best. I mount, I riseBehind a massy basis which upheldJove grasping thunder, and Saturnia crown'd,Who at his side outstretch'd her scepter'd hand.The troops succeeding fill the spacious dome.Last, unexpected, thence more welcome, rose,Detach'd from Medon with five hundred spears,Brave Haliartus, who repair'd the wantOf my disabled colleague. Now the priest:Ye chiefs, auxiliar to the gods profan'd,And men oppress'd, securely you have reach'dThe citadel of Oreus. The dark hour
Befriends your high attempt. Let one possessThe only entrance from the town below,The other swift the palace must surprise,Where Demonax lies slumb'ring, if his guiltAdmits of rest, and dreams not of your spears.With small resistance from a drowsy guardI seiz'd the gate; the palace soon was forc'dBy Haliartus. Demonax maintain'd,From door to door fierce combat, till he sunk,Blaspheming ev'ry pow'r of heav'n and hell,On his own couch, beneath repeated woundsDelv'd in his body by the Carian sword,Whose point produc'd the sever'd head in view.These news, Sicinus, to Eudora bear,Themistocles began. Before her feetFall grateful, kiss for me her hallow'd robe;My venerable friend Tisander hail,To her, to him, this victory we owe.
Salute Timoxenus, my noble host,Greet his excelling daughter; let them hearOf brave Nicanor, and the Carian sword,Which, closing at a blow this dang'rous war,Preserves so many Greeks. Carystian chief,Accept from me good tidings in returnFor thine. Intelligence this hour hath brought,That vigilant Cleander hath possess'dThe naval fort, an inlet to the townFor this whole army, pouring from our shipsSuccessive numbers, if the Persian bandsYet meditate resistance. Not to giveTheir consternation leisure to subside,Against the walls each standard shall advance.He said, and gave command. The diff'rent chiefsHead their battalions. Oreus trembling seesEncircling danger; heralds in their pomp,Dread summoners, are nigh. Her foreign guard,
Depriv'd of wonted leaders, at the fallOf Demonax aghast, in thought beholdDeath in the conquer'd citadel extendHis hideous arms to beckon from the fleetCleander's valour, and from swarming tentsThemistocles. On his approach the gatesAre thrown abroad. From all the Persian bandsTheir javelins, shields, and banners on the groundPale fear deposits. Thus the yielding mastsOf all their canvass mariners divest,When Aeolus is riding on a stormTo overwhelm the vessel, which would driveIn full apparel to resist his ire.Th' Athenian, though triumphant, in his joyOmits no care. To Aeschylus awhileThe charge supreme transferring, he ascendsThe citadel; the Carian victor thereConducts him o'er the palace, shews the corse
Of Demonax, his treasury unspoil'd,By chosen Locrians guarded. Pleas'd, the chiefEmbraces Haliartus: Friend, he said,Though late acquir'd, inestimable friend,How shall I praise thee? but my bosom wraptIn long concealment, now to thee aloneDisclos'd, shall warrant my profess'd regard.Know, that whatever thou hast heard, or seenOf my Euboean labours, are no more,Than preparation for a wider stageOf action. Gold, one necessary means,Thou hast provided; but I want a manOf hardy limbs and vig'rous, bold, discreet,Who all the Persian quarters would explore,On either side Thermopylae; would traceWhate'er employs Mardonius, what the timeHe takes the field, and where his gather'd storesOf war deposits. Thessaly provok'dLong since my just resentment. Ere the king
Of Asia pass'd the Hellespont, I ledTen thousand Greeks her passes to defend;By her deserted and betray'd, I march'dUnprofitably back. The Carian here:Had I endowments equal to my will,I were that man. Accept me, as I am,Vers'd in those borders, me, whose faithful zealLeonidas experienc'd and approv'd;So let Themistocles. My rustic weedsI can resume to range th' Oetaean crags,The fields of Locris, and Thessalia's plains.Thou art that man, th' Athenian quick rejoin'd;Then hold thee ready. Sudden in their birthAre my resolves, and when mature have wings.This said, he visits Aeschylus below.Judicious he in stations had dispos'd
The various bands; the pris'ners were secur'd.Throughout th' Orēan streets and dwellings reign'dTranquillity and order. Him the sonOf Neocles bespake: To-morrow's dawnShall see thee honour'd, as becomes a chief,Whom Aristides nam'd, and Athens choseTo save Euboea. I defer till nightOur consultations. I, not wanted here,Will reascend the citadel; the voiceOf friendship calls me to a tender care.He seeks the fane. Elephenor he greets;Applause to him in gratitude unfeign'dPresenting, next his earnest lips enquireOf Hyacinthus. Here the rev'rend man:First know, his dear Cleora is alive.I, priest of Jove, and Pamphila my wife,Who to th' Olympian empress in this seatOf blended rites are ministers, when told
That Demonax had doom'd his child to death,Solicited her pardon in the namesOf both divinities. At both he spurn'd,While we contriv'd this stratagem. Her nurse,By us admonish'd, in due time declar'dCleora dead. The body of a slave,A youthful maiden recently expir'd,Was for Cleora carried to the flames,While her we shelter'd in a secret cell,From human sight, from sight of day conceal'd.These pow'rs, alike offended at th' intentAs perpetration of an impious deed,Have sent thee forth their instrument of wrath,Divinely-prompted hero. Wilt thou shedOn Hyacinthus and Cleora's blissThy guardian smile? This utter'd, down the stepsHe guides th' Athenian to the hidden cell.By his Cleora Hyacinthus sat.The youthful husband o'er the snowy breast,
Which lull'd and cherish'd a reposing babe,The blooming father o'er that precious fruitHung fondly. Thoughtful ecstasy recall'dHis dream at Juno's temple; where he sawThe visionary bosom of his brideDisclose maternal to an infant newThat pillow smooth of lillies. Wan her cheekTold her confinement from the cheerful day.Six moons in deep obscurity she dwelt;Where, as a sea-nymph underneath a rock,Or Indian genie in the cavern'd earth,Her cell in conchs and coral she had dress'd,By gracious Pamphila supply'd to cheatTime and despair. The loom her patient artHad plied, her own sad story had begun,Now to conclude in joy. The starting youthBeholds his patron, rushes on his breastIn transport thus: Redeemer of my peace!Balm of my grief! of happiness my source!
My health of mind and body is thy gift.If in his anguish Hyacinthus feltHis obligation, in the hour of blissTo what excess must gratitude expandHis bosom now! Cleora and my childI owe to thy protection—this is she,This is my goddess, this my light, my joy,Deriv'd from thy humanity. Thou godOf Hyacinthus, tutelary god!Thou from the pit of horror didst upraiseMy limbs, for ever to its bottom chain'dWithout thy helpful hand; without thee deathHad been my portion; never had I liv'dTo see Cleora, never known this day!But will my gen'ral overlook my fault?Thy soldier, in his subterranean marchTow'rds this retirement, threw a casual glance,Which met Cleora's. Down the shield and spearDropp'd from my hands disabled; life forsook
My heart, which irrecoverably lostAll sense of duty both to thee and Greece,By me alone deserted. Bless that chance,Themistocles replies, and leads asideTh' attentive youth. Perhaps these gods ordain'd,In compensation of thy long distress,In recompense of pure and constant love,That to Cleora thou unstain'd with blood,Blood of her father by another slain,Shouldst be restor'd, nor taint with horrors newThis thy new hymen. Aeschylus by mornWill sit in judgment righteous, but severe,On each Euboean criminal, the deadNot less than living. Instantly removeTo thy Carystian home thy wife and babe;Whate'er can pass in Oreus must offendHer eye and ear. Then turning to the fair:From warlike toils thy consort I dismiss;He, who so nobly signaliz'd his sword
In single combat, and the open field,And prov'd his valour equal to his love,All future palms to others may resign.Whatever comforts, time and peace can yield,Are due to both your suff'rings; nor an hourShalt thou be cloister'd in this rueful cell.Elephenor, discreet and rev'rend man,Let thy kind clue conduct their secret steps.With presents laden, tokens of my love,Cars shall attend them at the cavern's mouth;Thou add thy blessing, that their new-born dayMay never set in sorrow. Thus the chief,Relax'd from busy care, amid success,Which not a shade of obstacle o'erhangs,Spake, as he felt, remunerating fullFor all his service Hyacinthus brave.His knees embracing, thus Cleora spake:I have not utt'rance for my grateful heart;
If thou dismiss us never more to seeThy guardian face, our day will set in grief.In smiles th' Athenian dissipates that fear:Long ere thy husband's magisterial termIs finish'd, I have further still to craveFrom him as archon, not as soldier, help.This to Carystus would alone directMy footsteps; else amid domestic joysTo see thy days illumin'd, precious timeThemistocles would borrow from his charge.Thus in the grateful fair-one he secur'dAnother friend, if wanted to supportHis vast designs, which, gath'ring on his mind,Speed his departure with a kind farewell.The cars he orders, from the tyrant's storesRich presents draws, to Aeschylus returns,With him in conf'rence spends remaining day.Aurora hears Themistocles commandStern proclamation by the trumpet's voiceFor judgment on the guilty. All in chainsThe tyrant's hated counsellors are brought,Save Lamachus by faith of treaty safeBound to Thessalian shores; but chief the sev'nGeraestian ruffians, their assassin headsHang hopeless down. Amid the widest spaceIn Oreus lofty a tribunal stands,Which Aeschylus ascends, commander highOf troops enroll'd by Athens. So her sonDisgrac'd, but courting favour new, devis'dHer democratic jealousy to sooth.The various chieftains, through this glorious warSo late distinguish'd, round the solemn seatConspicuous wait, Themistocles himselfAt the right hand of Aeschylus. He sitsLike Minos sage, whose justice gain'd from JoveTh' appointment awful to condemn, or spareHis fellow mortals in the world below.When now th' accusers and accus'd were heard,Thus spake the warrior-poet: Crimes like theseThe legislator punishes with death;Let us attempt within our scanty sphere,Far as we may, to imitate the godsIn punishment deserv'd. Through those abodesWhich Hades governs, long the vulture gnaws;Long is the toil of Sisyphus; to fillTheir leaking vases long the murd'rous seedOf Danaus must strive. By labour, pain,And shame continu'd, let flagitious menLong wish to end their suff'rings, not enjoyThat wish'd-for period in a single pang.This heavy sentence on assassin heads,On foul, atrocious counsellors of ill,Lo! I pronounce. An ignominious brandImprint on every forehead; plunge them chain'd,Debas'd by vile impurity of garb,In deep Chalcidian quarries; give them food
Just for endurance of continued toil,With daily stripes, that cruelty may feelWhat she inflicts on others, and, impell'dBy desperation, court relief in death.Before the gate of Oreus on a crossExtend the limbs of Demonax; the fleshLet kites deform, let parching air the bonesOf that despotic malefactor bleach,Avenging man, and vindicating heav'n.Flow next a strain more pleasing through the ear,A strain delightful to that fav'ring godWho first created laurel to adornThe good and brave. A chaplet from his tree,Ten captives, ten selected suits of armsTo ev'ry leader; one Barbarian slave,A sabre, targe, whatever to the fieldAccouters one Barbarian, I allotTo ev'ry soldier. Phoebus will supplyHis laurel too, encompassing your brows,
Ye gen'rous people. But a splendid storeOf tripods, urns, and images provideFor great Eudora, and th' Eretrian seer,That your triumphal off'ring may emblazeEuboea's fanes; nor less with honours greetElephenor, your genius of success.Eudora's portion thou, heroic priest,Phoebean Timon, to her presence bear.I need but name Acanthè to attractYour veneration; for Acanthè chuse,Sweet paragon of Chalcis, from your spoilsThe costly tissue of Barbaric looms,And dazzling gems, that gratitude may vieWith obligation. Haliartus, brightIn recent glories from a tyrant slain,Thou at her feet the precious tribute lay.For me, if, servant of Cecropia's state,I have upheld her justice and renown,Your approbation is the sole reward
Which I solicit, or will bear awayOn my returning keel. He ceas'd. In roarSurpassing waves, which beat the craggy strandAmidst a tempest, from the gen'ral hostBroke forth applause. The mistocles subjoin'd:Awhile, my friends, your labours I suspend;Go to your homes; to kind, expecting wivesRecount your trophies; let your children seePaternal mansions hung with Asian spoils.Remember still, that valour must not sleep;That law restor'd and freedom are not firmWhile Asia's trumpet sounds a blast in Greece.Two days elapse; Timoxenus, arriv'dFrom Chalcis, joyful gratulation brings.Solicitous th' Athenian first enquiresOf fair Acanthè's state. The father fondThus answers: Wasting malady is fled,
But hath behind it left indiff'rence coldTo ev'ry joy. Thy wife a bracelet sent;These words the bearer Hallartus brought,Charg'd by Timothea elegant and wise."From me this present when Acanthè takes,"Say, how I prize her elevated mind,"Enabling my Themistocles to quell"The hateful breed of tyrants. Further say,"The man engaging her connubial hand"I should esteem the favorite of heav'n."I heard approving; on the grateful hintA secret hour I chose; my daughter's earI thus address'd. "My only child and hope,"Shall no sweet offspring cheer a grandsire's age?"Shall my possessions to a stranger pass,"My blood be lost for ever? Shall this war,"Thy work, Acanthè, which a father's love,"In all to thee complying, at thy suit"Commenc'd, produce no here to console"Thy widow'd couch?" "The sacrifice of life,
"Of my ideal, or my real peace,"Is due to such a father," she exclaim'dIn pious fervour. "Arguments to urge"Against thy plea my age and thine forbid;"But ah! dear parent, my capricious fate"Presents no suitor to thy child's esteem."The Amarynthian priestess, whose controulSurpasses mine, with sternness oft enforc'dMy just desire. At length my daughter thusOn my departure: "I obey; consult"Themistocles; let him a consort name,"Who best hath serv'd him in this righteous war."Ne'er yet ill chance, or sorrow, from the sonOf Neocles drew tears. His soul reflectsOn this transcendent fair one, who had chang'dThe violence of passion to respectSo confidential, dress'd in sweetest graceSo far beyond his merits tow'rds a heart
Of purest texture, late by him misledTo error, now to purity restor'dBy native honour. At th' affecting thoughtHe turns those eyes, till then of stedfast lookOn all events and objects, turns asideTo hide their oozing dews; yet soon he spake:None can I name, but wise Timothea's choiceTo bear her present, Haliartus brave,Who hath avow'd to Aeschylus and meA veneration for thy matchless child;But he, appointed to a service high,Like Hercules must labour yet to gainThe sum of bliss. For three successive moonsHe must continue mine. The past eventsIn copious strains the hero now rehears'd,Concluding thus: The army I disband;Great Aeschylus for Athens straight embarks;I shall remain in Oreus to compose
This troubled city; thou resume thy way;The criminals transported in thy trainLock in the quarries; to Acanthè allUnravel; her and Chalcis too prepareFor due reception of that happy man,Whom Jove hath honour'd in a tyrant's death,Whom Juno soon in nuptial ties will bless,And all Euboea to Acanthè sendsWith tokens rich of public praise and love.With joy Timoxenus assents; the mornSees him depart; at Chalcis he arrives,Performing all Themistocles enjoin'd.Now ev'ry temple breathes perfumes; prepar'dAre chosen victims, colonnades and gatesWith chaplets hung; the garden's flow'ry growth,Each scented produce of luxuriant fields,The maids and matrons bear to welcome homeTriumphant warriors. Now th' expected gleams
Of armour tinge the champaign's utmost verge;Near and more near the military pomp,At large develop'd o'er the green expanse,Spears, bucklers, helmets, plumes, Barbaric spoilsIn trophies pil'd on hollow-sounding cars,Grow on the sight. Through Chalcis lies the march;Those in abode the most remote precede.Geraestian banners first Eudemus shews;With Lampon follow Styra's gallant troop;The Amarynthian and Carystian bandsNicanor leads; th' Eretrians, now becomeOnce more a people, with their wives and raceAt length redeem'd, to Cleon's orders move.In blooming garlands had the mothers deck'dTheir children's heads, whom, tripping through the streets,Spectatress equal to the loftiest scene,
Eudora blesses. Sweet Acanthè meltsIn tears of gladness, while her father nighAwakes attention to a num'rous train,Her native friends, whom brave Nearchus heads.These are thy warriors, fondly cries the sire;To whom Eudora: Who is he in statePontifical, a holy man in arms?Three hundred Delphians then were passing by,Phoebean branches twisted round their spears.Behind them, lodg'd on axles rolling slow,Were vases, tripods, images and busts,Spoils of the palace Demonax had rais'd.Thou seest, replies Timoxenus, a formTo Phoebus dear, the venerable formOf Timon, priest and soldier. From that carHe will descend to kiss thy sacred hand,
Before thy feet a precious tribute layFor thy pure goddess, sister of his god.But look, my sweet Acanthè, on the manThemistocles hath chosen to reviveMy drooping years. Preceded by a troopOf youths, whom Medon, ever kind, hath cull'dFrom all his Locrian files to grace his friend;Preceded by a trophy, which displaysThe silver mail of Demonax, his shield,His helm of gold, his variegated arms,And spear in length ten cubits, which upholdsThe tyrant's head, his victor meets our eyes,Th' illustrious son of Lygdamis. She castNot an impassion'd, but revering glanceOn one, whose might victorious had dissolv'dEuboean thraldom, one of noble frame,In feature comely, and in look serene,Whom her sole guide, the all controlling sonOf Neocles, had destin'd for her lord.
Her dream recurs; the tyrant's head she sees;Th' exploit sublime, though not by him achiev'd,Whom partial fancy on her pillow shew'd,Her ever-wakeful loftiness of mindAdmires impartial, and applauds the handWhich dealt the glorious blow. Her awful browThe priestless softens to a smile, and thus:Is this suitor, whom my hero choseFor bright Acanthè? Favour'd by the gods,Themistocles in ev'ry action provesHe cannot err. Acanthè hears, and press'dBy duty's insurmountable controul,Aw'd by Eudora's majesty austere,Resolves to meet him with becoming grace,But of his virtue make one trial more.The Delphian priest and Haliartus quitTheir chariots; them Timoxenus receives
To his rich mansion and a sumptuous board.Eudora there, with curious eyes and voice,Explores and questions oft the Carian brave.His Delphian friend, observing, in these wordsBesought him: O, distinguish'd by the gods!Who have in thee their care of virtue shewn,Since from Euboea thou must soon depart,Lose not the present hour. These matchless damesMust hear thy wond'rous narrative at large;For singular thy fortunes with eventsAre interwoven to delight the ear,Affect the heart, and win th' applauding tongue;That all may honour thy desert supremeLike me, so much thy debtor. Straight compliesThe modest Carian; list'ning silence reigns.In native windings from his Lydian fountAs various flow'd Maeander, here alongA level champaign, daisy-painted meads,
Or golden fields of Ceres, here through woodsIn green arcades projecting o'er his banks,There shut in rock, which irritates the stream,Here by low hamlets, there by stately towns,Till he attained the rich Magnesian seat;Thence with augmented fame and prouder floodsRoll'd down his plenteous tribute to the main:So through the mazes of his fortune windsIn artless eloquence th' expressive strainOf Haliartus, from his peasant stateTo scenes heroic. Humble still in mind,Compell'd to follow truth's historic clue,He ends in glory, which his blushes grace;Nor less they grace these frank and manly words,Which to Acanthè singly he directs:Such as I am, thou elevated fair,Who hast Euboea's liberty restor'd,Her grateful off'rings to thy feet I bring;
With them an humble suppliant to thy smile,That he may rank thy soldier, in thy nameHis own distinguish, and, achieving wellThe task by great Themistocles impos'd,Deserve Acanthè's favour. She repliesWith virtuous art: Can soldiers never knowSatiety of fame? must her careerBe still beginning, never be complete?Must ev'ry passion yield to thirst of praise?Should I request thee, wouldst thou for my sakeThy new attempt relinquish, to enjoyThy ample portion of acquir'd renownIn peace at Chalcis? Haliartus then:Not love of fame, which oft'ner frowns than smiles,Not victory, nor spoil inflate my breastAll unaspiring. Sense of duty pure,Of obligation, which I owe to Greece,Themistocles, and Medon, rules supreme
Within my soul. O first of mortal fair,Thou of his peace thy servant might'st deprive;But, wert thou fairer than the Paphian queen,In each excelling art like Pallas skill'd,Her paragon in wisdom, thy requestShould thus be answer'd from a bleeding heart:To my performance of the trust repos'dThe only bar is fate. Astonish'd gaz'dTimoxenus; nor knew the timid sireThat his Acanthè's breast then first conceiv'dA spark of passion, but a spark divine,Such as for heroes goddesses have felt;As Thetis glow'd for Peleus. Thus the fair:O most deserving of that hero's choice,To which alone Acanthè left her fate!Weigh'd in the balance, nor deficient found,Thou more than worthy of a hand like mine!Go, but return; triumphantly return
Lord of Acanthè; of my truth unchang'dAccept this pledge. She gave, he kiss'd her hand.Eudora's vestment, while the solemn sceneHer looks approv'd, with fervent lips he touch'd;Then, clasping glad Timoxenus, retir'dTo hoist his canvass in the morning gale.End of the Nineteenth Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the TWENTIETH.AN April zephyr, with reviving sweetsFrom gay Euboea's myrtle-border'd meads,Perfumes his breath, scarce ruffling in his courseThe pearly robe of morn. A ready skiffThe Carian hero mounts; the gale, though soft,To him is adverse. From a rapid keelOf Oreus, lo! Sicinus lifts a signOf salutation. Haliartus joinsThe faithful man, and joyfully relatesHis acquisition of Acanthé's hand.
To good Sicinus grateful sounds the tale,Who thus replies: To Athens I proceed.No sooner march'd the warriors to their homes,Than, disengag'd from public care, my lordAddress'd me thus: Sicinus, spread the sail,To Athens fly; my wife and offspring waftTo my embraces; that, while gentle restRemits the labours of my limbs disarm'd,I with Timothea, she with me, may shareThe past success, and taste of present joy.Thee, Haliartus, she esteems; thy fame,Exploits and fortune will augment her bliss.But of this friendly gale a moment moreI must not lose. His vessel sails along;The other slowly with laborious strokesOf oars contends for passage, till broad noonFlames on the laurell'd poops and colours gayOf Athens and Troezene; on whose decks,Emblaz'd with spoils, and trophies, Phoebus pours
His whole effulgence. Back to Attic strandsThey steer in view. To fifes and trumpets clearFrom ev'ry vessel in a blended soundReply the concave shores. Now sudden shiftsThe wind, and checks their progress; but permitsGlad Haliartus close behind the helmOf Aeschylus to pass. The choral notesOf triumph then were hush'd. The warrior-bard,Who had so well accomplish'd all his charge,Like Jove in judgment, on the plain like Mars,Sat in oblivion of his arms, which layBeside him. O'er the Heliconian hillIn thought he wander'd, and invok'd the MuseTo sing of civic harmony. The MuseTo Aristides, and the conqu'ring sonOf Neocles united, touch'd the lyreWith melody rejoicing at their names.The Attic warriors throng'd the silent decks,The shrouds and yards. Attention clos'd their lips,
Their minds were open'd. Musical and learn'd,Minerva's chosen people had been wontTo hear his numbers in the tragic scene.Sententious weight of poesy, combin'dWith music's pow'rful spell, there tam'd the rude,Abash'd the vicious, and the good refin'd.Oh! Artemisia, Haliartus sigh'd,While at the strain his progress he delay'd,How canst thou splendid vassalage preferIn barb'rous climes, the residence of slaves,To Greece, the land of freedom, arts and arms,The legislator's and the hero's seat,The guardian pure of equity and laws,The nurse of orphans helpless and oppress'd,Of all, whom Phoebus and the Muses liftAbove the rank of mortals! Greece, I oweMore than my birth and being to thy love,My sentiments I owe. Adopted child,For thee my better parent now I go
To hazard all in voluntary zeal,Ev'n the possession of Acanthè's charms.On Atalantè's sea-beat verge he lands;Swift he collects his peasant weeds, the crook,The pipe and scrip, thus musing: Ancient garb,Thou dost remind me of Oïleus good,Dost summon all my gratitude to prove,That he, who benefits receives, and feelsA grateful sense, is happy. From his side,His arm, and temples, he ungirds the sword,The shield releases, and unclasps the helm;These he commits, Sophronia, to thy care,Spouse of Leonteus, mother of the raceOïlean. Them, in tenderness embrac'd,He leaves with blessings, re-embarks and printsHis bounding feet on Locris. Hermes thusIn shepherd's weeds his deity conceal'd,By Jove's appointment on the flow'ry meads
Of Inachus alighting; where he stoleOn watchful Argus, and, his hundred eyesEluding, rescu'd from her bestial formAfflicted Io. Like the mountain roeThe son of Lygdamis in speed excell'd;He, had he run for Atalanta's love,Would have rejected Cytherea's aid,Nor, of her swiftness to beguile the fair,Before her steps the golden apples thrown.He quits the shore impatient; on he fliesUnquestion'd, rank'd among the Locrian hinds,All Persian subjects now. A midnight courseTo Oeta's well-known mountains he prefersThrough winding vallies, sprinkled with his tearsIn memory of past events. He findsThe track to Mycon's hut; that goat-herd hearsThe sound of footsteps through the morning dew;He sees, he flies to Meliboeus, clingsAround his neck. The seeming shepherd thus:Kind friend, inform me of Melissa's weal.To him the swain: In wonder thou wilt hear,That no Barbarian dares ascend this hill;Th' attempt with death Mardonius would chastise.Benign Masistius, who his freedom gain'dFrom gen'rous Medon, to his sister thusThe benefit repays. He often viewsThermopylae, inspects th' obsequious band,Which guards the cavern'd passage to our fane;The fane he visits. Pleas'd, Melissa greetsThe gentle Persian, who delights to speakOf Aristides righteous and humane,Of Medon's valour on Psittalia's isle,Who made Masistius captive. Thus at timesThe tedious winter's melancholy hoursShe sooth'd; depriv'd of thee, superior swain,At times convers'd with Mycon. She hath tun'dMy pipe to music, purify'd my tongue,Refin'd its language, and my soul enlarg'd.
Despairing never of the public weal,To Aristides, virtuous guardian pow'rOf Greece, she strikes her celebrating chords.So will she, Mycon, to the conqu'ring sonOf Neocles, our second guardian pow'r,Cries Haliartus; but too long I waitTo hail my holy mistress. She, rejoinsThe swain, hath left this mountain. Forty days,Since I beheld Masistius, are elaps'd;His welcome hand before Melissa plac'dA woman, rather deity in form;The hoary temple with her beauty seem'dIllumin'd; regal was her state; her spouse,The youthful king of Macedon, was by.She, in Melissa's presence, cast asideHer majesty; a suppliant in these words,Whose strong impression I retain, she spake:"Most gracious, learn'd, and prudent of thy rank,"In Greece the highest, I, in Delphi born,"Phoebean Timon's child, a pious suit"Both in my father's and Apollo's name"To thee prefer. Trachiniae's neighb'ring walls"Contain the object of my tend'rest care,"Sandaucè, thither from Emathian bounds"For help convey'd. Masistius will confirm,"Whate'er I utter in Sandaucè's praise."Her virtues more than equal her estate"Of princess, Xerxes' sister; but her woes"Almost exceed her virtues. Nature droops"Beneath its burden, sickness wastes her youth,"Resists all med'cine, while her feeble frame"To dissolution verges. O belov'd"By ev'ry Muse illumining thy mind"With ev'ry science, holy woman, fam'd"Among these nations for benignant deeds,"Vouchsafe, descending from thy pure abode,"To grant thy healing aid". Masistius then:"This is the princess, who her husband saw"Slain at her feet, her infants doom'd to death"By Euphrantides; never since that day"The wound inflicted on her gentle heart"Admitted cure." The charitable suitPrevail'd, and soon Trachiniae's gates receiv'dThe priestess borne in Amarantha's car.Here Haliartus: Hast thou never seen,Among the Persians who frequent this hill,A youth in rosy vigour, by the nameOf Artamanes known? I have, returnsThe goat-herd; he with Amarantha came;Seem'd doubly anxious for Melissa's helpTo yon afflicted princess; urg'd the suitIn Medon's name, his friend and saviour styl'd,Who made him captive on Psittalia's shore.But on his cheek the roses, thou dost paint,No longer bloom; his visage, worn and pale,Denotes some inward malady, or grief.
Now, Meliboeus, to my longing earThy history unfold. We parted last,Thou mayst remember, on this fatal spot.The gentle Agis from this point survey'dYon froth of torrents in their stony beds,Yon shagged rocks, and that disastrous passBeneath us; whence Barbarian numbers hugeO'erwhelm'd Thermopylae. But first acceptRefreshment. Under hairy boughs of pinesA rustic board he piles with oaten loaves,Dry'd fruits and chestnuts; bubbling nigh, a springSupplies their bev'rage. Here th' illustrious sonOf Lygdamis recounts a copious taleTo wond'ring Mycon; but his birth conceals,And consanguinity with Caria's queen.He stops to note the narrow passage throng'dWith laden mules and camels. Mycon then:These are my constant spectacle; his hostMardonius now assembles. He transports,Alpenus, yonder Locrian town, receivesThe gather'd produce of Thessalia's fields;Nicaea's fort contains an equal store,Preparatives for war. Where lies the camp,The Carian questions? On the Malian plain,Which Oeta's cliffs command, the swain reply'd.New tents on clear Spercheos daily riseOf Persians banded from their winter holds;Thou shalt behold them; follow. Both proceedAlong the green expanse Melissa lov'd;Where genial spring had form'd of tufted shrubsA florid cincture to the lucid poolBehind the dome, inviolable seatOf all the Muses. Thence harmonious nymphs,Part of Melissa's ministerial choir,Left in their function, with mellifluent voiceTo harps in cadence true enchant the soul
Of Haliartus, doubly charm'd to hearLeonidas the theme. With numbers sweetHis praise inwoven by Melissa's skillWas their diurnal song. But sorrow soonInvades a breast, where gratitude presides;The time and place to Haliartus rise,Where he and Medon took their last farewellOf that devoted hero. In a sighThe Carian thus: O well-remember'd sceneOnce to these eyes delectable! Thy flow'rsHave lost their odour; thy crystalline poolIs dull in aspect to my sad'ning sight;You cannot sooth, melodious maids, the painOf recollection, starting at the nameYour measures sound. Beneath yon solemn beechRegret sits weeping; Lacedaemon's kingThere of terrestrial music heard the lastFrom Aeschylus, the last of banquets shar'dWith good Oïleus' daughter. Mycon here:Suppress this grief; the priestess has forbidAll lamentation for that hero's fate,Who died so glorious. Follow to the cliff.They soon attain a high projecting point,When Haliartus in a second sigh:Here stood Melissa; from her sacred lipsThe queen of Caria hence endur'd reproof;Hence did the great Leonidas exploreTh' advancing Persians, when his prudent careThe trees and marble fragments had amass'd,Which from the mountain overwhelm'd belowSuch multitudes of foes. But, Mycon, speak,What is that cross beside the public way?Ah! Meliboeus, let thy spirit grieveLike mine, exclaims, in gushing tears, the swain;
Lo! Xerxes' coward vengeance! Thou behold'stLeonidas suspended on that cross.As oft, when lightning strikes the human frame,The wound, though imperceptible, destroysEach vital pow'r throughout the stiff'ning limbs,Which still retain their posture; rigid thusIs Haliartus; riveted to earthHe seems, nor utters sound, nor breathes, nor movesHis ghastly eyeballs. Now, when Mycon thriceHis name repeated, briefly he replies:I am benumb'd—Conduct me to a cellWhere I may slumber—Tend thy herd—ExpectMe at thy home. A mossy cave is nigh;There Mycon leaves him. Haliartus stays,Not slumb'ring, but, when Mycon is remote,Darts from the shelter, traverses a wood,Descends a crag, which bounds the upper straits,
Thence winds his rapid journey to the cross,Which stands a witness of Barbaric rage.His ardent zeal to free those honour'd bonesAdmits no pause. The midnight watch is past;Importunate and hateful, birds obsceneAre gather'd round; disturb'd, their grating shrieksThey mix, and clatter their ill-omen'd wings.A station'd guard is rous'd; resistless forceSurrounds the Carian, seizes, leads him boundBefore the chieftain of a camp advanc'd.He, at the sight of Haliartus charg'dWith guilt, whose punishment is death, commandsTh' accusing soldiers to retire, and thus:Alas! hath sorrow so impair'd the hueOf Artamanes, that oblivion masksHis face from Haliartus. Thee I know,Thee Meliboeus once, benignant swain,My comforter in bondage, when we plough'd
The Grecian seas in Delphian Timon's bark.Was not I present, when the genuine seedOf Lygdamis in thee Aronces trac'd?But, O! illustrious brother of a queenAdor'd in Asia, what disastrous starThy midnight steps misguided, to incurThe king's immutable decree of death?Thy bold attempt was virtuous, but his willHath made thy virtue criminal. Thy headAt his own peril Artamanes stillShall guard; thy liberty accept; myselfWill be thy guide to safety. Ah! repliesThe gen'rous son of Lygdamis, and claspsThe meritorious Persian, I perceiveStill unimpair'd thy virtues; but receiveThy noble proffer back. For my behoofNot with its shadow danger shall approachMy friend; thy pris'ner let me rest till morn.A lib'ral garb is all the boon I crave,
Then to Mardonius lead me; tell my crime,No grace solicit; who I am, conceal.In tears, replied the satrap: Then thou diest;The royal edict cannot be controll'd.It can, return'd the Carian; rest assur'd,My preservation in myself I bear.Oh! that with equal certainty my pow'rMight from thy bosom chace that inmate new,Whate'er it be, which violates thy peace,Thy early youth disfigures, and consumesIts fruit unripe. Ah! tell me, is it griefFor some dead friend, or sickness, or the smartOf injury, or love? Acanthè wak'dThat tender thought, which soften'd on the tongueOf Haliartus. From the Persian's breastA sigh, deep note of agony, which riv'dHis gentle heart, accompanied these words:Endear'd associate in affliction past,Thou, and thou only, dost unlock the breastOf Artamanes. It is love, my friend;The object, once possessing ev'ry charmExterior, still each beauty of the soul,By malady incurable devour'dFrom day to day is hast'ning to the tomb.Oh! long deplor'd Sandaucè; thee my stepsShall follow close—My passion is unknownTo her; peculiar was her state and mine,Too delicate at first for me to speak,For her to hear. My hopes malignant timeHath wasted since, my health in her decay.But while my heart is bleeding for my love,The sluice grows wider, and to friendship poursA stream enlarg'd. Thy danger—Ah! permit,That I reveal thy origin and rank;Thy sister's name can shake the king's decree.No, Artamanes, by th' immortal gods,Rejoins the Carian; of my just attempt,I, if succeeding, all the merit knew,If taken, knew my ransom. But the stars,Half through their circles run, suggest repose.May grief-asswaging heaviness of sleepEmbalm thy eyelids, and like mine thy breastFeel no disquiet; mayst thou rise again,Saluting hope the harbinger of peace.Stretch'd on a carpet Haliartus slept;Not so the troubled Persian, long disus'dTo lenient rest. Before the dawn he rose;Among the Greek auxiliars he procur'dApparel fair of Greece. His Carian guestAttir'd he guided o'er the Malian beach,To that august pavilion, which contain'dThe royal person once, Mardonius nowIn all the state of Xerxes, save the crown.Thus Artamanes: See a hapless man,Who hath attempted to remove the corseOf Sparta's king. That hapless man must die,Returns the gen'ral; Xerxes so ordain'd,Not I. Then absent on a charge remote,Mardonius knew not, nor approv'd when known,Th' indignity that noble corse sustain'd.To him the Carian: Mindarus to death,With hecatombs of nobles thou decreest,Who in Euboea will appease my ghost.Ha! who art thou, in agitation spakeThe satrap? Guard, bid Lamachus approach,Our visitor so recent from that isle.He was not far; the son of Gobryas thusAddress'd him ent'ring: Note that stranger well.Why dost thou start? Themistocles can boast
No bolder warrior, Lamachus exclaim'd;I was his captive in th' Orēan fight.Again the Carian: Truth for once he speaks;I dragg'd him bound my captive on that field;Ariobarzanes felt me; further learn,By me the savage Demonax was slain.But to have rescu'd from inhuman wrongThe mortal part of that transcendent man,Who living shook all Asia with dismay,Had been my proudest boast. Mardonius then:By Horomazes, I admire and prizeThy gen'rous flame, brave warrior! Under chargeOf Artamanes in Trachiniae's roundAwhile remain. Now, Lamachus, ascendSome ready bark; revisit yonder isle;This Greek for Mindarus exchange; redeemThe rest of Asia's nobles; I allot
For each a talent. In these words saluteThemistocles: "To Athens I have sent"Young Alexander, Macedonia's prince,"Ambassador of friendship; I would call"Themistocles ally; himself may name,"But Persia's bounty shall exceed his price."This if his Attic arrogance rejects,"Tell him, Mardonius, who disdains a war"Of oars and sails, the dubious ocean's sport,"Will give him battle on the plains of Thebes."Though Artamanes joyfully beholdsHis friend in safety, with a trembling stepTrachiniae's gates he passes to the roof,Which holds Sandaucè. Ent'ring, he perceivesMelissa. She, transported at the sightOf Haliartus, thus began: O friend!Dear to my sire, to all th' Oïlean house,What unexpected ecstacy were mine
At thy appearance, if—Ah! Persian lord,Sandaucè, sweet Sandaucè, yields to fate.Her dying lips on Artamanes call;Soft gratitude o'erflows her gentle breast;Her wish is eager, ere she breathe her last,To see her friend and guardian. Ending here,She moves before him; with unstable feet,With other prompters, anguish and despair,He follows. Pallid on her mournful couchThe princess lies; her infants weep around;Bright Amarantha in disorder'd garb,Unloosen'd hair, and frantic with distress,Stands nigh. The graces sadden on her front;Her beauteous eyes a gushing torrent pourLike overswelling fountains, once sereneThe lucid mirrors to encircling flow'rs,Now troubled by a storm, which levels roundThe growth of shade, and scatters on their faceUprooted shrubs in bloom. Her languid lipsAt length unclosing, thus Sandaucè spake:Omniscient God of nature! let me liftMy voice appealing. When before me layAutarctus slaughter'd, when these babes, condemn'dBy cruel rites, to sacrifice were led,Did not the creature of thy tend'rest moldFeel as a wife, a mother, and receiveA cureless wound? Thy providence uprais'dA kind protector through my lengthen'd walksOf grief, till now they terminate in death.If to his gen'rous purity of care,Assiduous, kind and pious, time hath rais'dWithin my breast a secret, soft return,Was this an error? Hath my heart abus'dThe sensibility, thou gav'st? AloneArt thou my judge. Creator, I obey;Before thy awful presence thou dost callSandaucè's youth; unconscious of a crime,My debt avow'd of gratitude I payBy this confession of my fleeting breath
To Artamanes. O! illustrious youth,Supreme in rank, in virtue still more high,Thy care continue to these orphan babes.She ceas'd, and speechless on her pillow sunk.Th' enamour'd Persian instant on the floorDropp'd, like a stony mass, which inward throesOf earth convulsive from a cliff disjoins;Dead monument of ruin on the beachImmoveable it lies. Melissa callsOn Haliartus; suddenly he bearsThe hapless youth, inanimate and cold,To an adjoining chamber. There outstretch'd,Restor'd to sense by kind, unwearied zealIn Haliartus, all the night he roam'dThrough sad delirium's labyrinths till morn;When lo! Melissa: Comfort thee, she said,The princess lives; the burden from her mindDischarg'd, hath render'd to the pow'rs of life
Exertion less confin'd, rekindling hopeOf restoration. So th' all-ruling godsVicissitude to nature have decreed;The mind, the body languishes to-day,Revives to morrow. . . . Interrupting cameMardonius thus: What tidings have I heardOf Artamanes and the princess deadBy malady most rare, a mutual flameToo long conceal'd? But ent'ring I receiv'dA milder tale; they live. Thou holy Greek!Employ thy science; save a lovely dame,Though Persian born; in him preserve my friend;Mardonius, long thy country's foe, to theeWill ne'er be hostile. To Sandaucè go,Say from my lips, and, Artamanes, hear,The flow'r of nobles Xerxes shall not loseThrough disappointed passion; were my friendLess than he is, among the satraps least,At my enforcement shall the king unite
Their nuptial hands. Now rouse thee, gallant youth,Not long thy gen'ral from his side can spareThy worth approv'd. Masistius is remote;In virtue rich beyond a mortal's share,But to that virtue never yielding rest,He for a time on high adventure bentHath left me; thou his vacant place must fill.The son of Gobryas to his tent returns.End of the Twentieth Book.ERRATA.B.
