Mr. ADDISON's FINE ODE TO Dr. Tho. Burnet, &c.Mr. ADDISON's FINE ODE TO Dr. Thomas Burnet, On His SACRED THEORY of the EARTH. Done into English by the Author of a late TALE call'd COFFEE.Nec Verbum Verbo curabis reddere, FidusInterpres. —HOR.LONDON: Printed for T. WARNER, at the Black-Boy in Pater-Noster-Row. M.DCC.XXVII.TO THE KING and QUEEN's MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTIES.SIR and MADAM!THE noble System, of which Mr. Addison's incomparable Poem is an exact Miniature; was graciously received, when formerly addressed to a KING and a QUEEN, Your Royal Predecessors. Together with which Gentleman's most elegant Epitome, my faint

Copy of it is submissively offered at the Feet of BOTH Your MAJESTIES; that ONE in a well-tasted Dead-language, the OTHER in an obliged and favoured Living-one, may take a summary View of the Place of Your SECOND Coronation; in happy Prelude to a THIRD, which Ye are farther to enjoy, in the ultimate and beatific Receptacle of the JUST and GOOD. A presumptuous Wish, that these grand Revolutions may, for your People's intermediate Advantage, commence Late, must first ask Pardon; and, on that Dependence, is sincerely professed to be the constant and fervent Prayer, of almost the Privatest amongstYour MAJESTIES Most Unfeigned, most Humble, And most Obedient Subjects.AD INSIGNISSIMUM VIRUM, D.

Earth's headlong Plunge,Amidst the Fluids under.Imprison'd Waves, disturb'd,Start from their midland Bed;And, with impetuous Rage,O'er their Oppressor spread.Huge Fragments, shapeless Lumps,Immanely float around;Vast, hideous, ShattersOf primigenial Ground!The now free-wallowing Whale,With all the finny Race;Stare at the Sun, astonish'dBy his golden Face:The silver Moon and StarsThen gild the Watry-way,And on its curling SurfaceTremulously play.How strong thy Words! What must weThy Large-Genius call?No Copy can come Up,To thy Original.Whence was the first Discov'ry,Of thy Nostrum, made?To bar again such Flood-gates,When once Open laid!What Fears, what Jealousies,Distract the thoughtful Head?Since taught by Thee! our FeetOn faithless Ruins tread.But still! this Rubbish, rescu'dFrom Diluvian-Fate;Kind Providence restores,To it's primeval State.Lo! the Grand-Architect,In secondary Ire;With alter'd Scheme refinesA Globe relaps'd, by Fire.From His consuming Torch;This just Vindictive brings,Inclusively, one Fun'ral-PileTo Men and Things.The lofty'st Alp, at first,Griev'd for it's dripping Ice;Gutt'ring, at last, It-SelfA molten Quarry lies.And Now pour ratling-down,In furious Career!The sympathizing RampiersOf the Atmosphere:Thunder, and Lightning, Lambents,Hail, Wind, Rain, and Snow;With all th' aspiring Train,Of Meteors from below.Into the common Blaze,Then will thy TOMES be hurl'd;Impossible to fail,Till jointly with the World!Here shifts the Scene; Now ceaseAll sublunary Toils;On a re-level'd Orb,A sudden Verdure smiles!A constant Equinox maintainsPerpetual Spring,And virtuous Minds IdeasOf Contentment sing.The Architect well-pleas'd,While West-winds balm the Air,Desists; and lastly says: Behold!The Work is Fair.What now, Immense Cosmographer!To Thee is due?Distanc'd I stop; — But, ifMy Prophecy be true:There Paradise-regain'd,Unknowing Care or Want;Shall, like our Earth, be proudOf Thee it's Habitant.And may'st Thou there in pure Devotions join,With glorious GEORGE, and beauteous CAROLINE!WHO, far as the Materials will bear,Labour to constitute an EDEN here;By steadily bestowing their Commands,On best-computing Heads, and best-performing Hands.FINIS.
