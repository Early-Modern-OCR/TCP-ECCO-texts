THE Countess of Salisbury.A TRAGEDY.As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN THE HAY-MARKET.BY HALL HARTSON, ESQR.LONDON: Sold by W. GRIFFIN, in Catharine-Street. 1767.[Pr. 1. 6d.]TO ELIZABETH, COUNTESS OF MOIRA.MADAM,THE attention you have vouchsafed to the Countess of Salisbury and the Author, ever since they have had the honour of being known to your Ladyship, persuades me that you will take pleasure in hearing it has been favourably received on the English Theatre. Stript now of all stage decoration, and the assistance which it has hitherto received from the most animated performance, it is to undergo a stricter scrutiny, that of the closet; a scrutiny for which it is indeed but little provided. I know your Ladyship will make a tender allowance for want of experience in the Author, and such errors as are incident to human inperfection; but this is an indulgence, which I doubt the critic will not so readily shew him. But however he may censure, I must ever think myself happy in having already acquired your Ladyship's good opinions. I am also flattered, as often as I think of the near resemblance my Heroine has of your Ladyship. Had I been earlier honoured with your Ladyship's acquaintance, I think I could have much enlarged the

character. And yet there are many virtues, many delicacies, which it would have been impossible for me to have preserved in the picture, of which those only can be truly sensible, who have the happiness of being acquainted with the Original.Please, Madam, to accept the following attempt, as an offering of my gratitude for many favours; an imperfect indeed, but honest proof, of the esteem, which is due from,MADAM,Your LADYSHIP's
Most respectful, Most obliged, Humble Servant,
H. HARTSON.ADVERTISEMENT.THE COUNTESS OF SALISBURY made her appearance about two years ago in Ireland, where she was received with very singular marks of favour; the Author there had many friends, and with all the partiality they might be supposed to have for him, those friends did not hesitate to declare, that the excellent performance of Mrs. Dancer and Mr. Barry, contributed largely to the success of the Piece: written in his early youth, without having much knowledge of the stage, or dramatic performances, the Author is sensible what his Tragedy must be, notwithstanding the smiles with which it has been indulged. England, agreeable to the character of good nature and generosity which it has established through all the world, has kindly followed the example of its sister nation, and received with an indulgence the attempt of a young Writer, who is indeed ambitious of pleasing, but dare not aspire to excellence. He attributes, in great measure, his good fortune now, to what his friends attributed it before, the animated performance of Mrs. Dancer and Mr. Barry: it is theirs to endeavour to support a reputation already gained, his to aim at improvement, in order to acquire one.PROLOGUE, SPOKEN BY Mr. WESTON, in the CHARACTER of a TEAGUE.MY jewels, I'm come to spake in the behalf—Hoot, Devil burn you all, you makes me laugh,Upon my soul now I don't take it well in you:Arra, be easy, till I'm after telling you:Smit with the love of glory and of pelf,To night, a bard from Dublin its ownself,Has brought a play here for your approbation,A very pretty thing by my salvation—If you'll trust Irish evidence I mean—I can't the story very well explain;But it's about a Countess and an Earl,The Countess is a mighty honest girl;But there's a villain with a damn'd cramp'd name,Makes such proposhals—'tis a burning shame—Another too—a Knight—bekeys as why—But hould you know, you'll see it by and by,And then 'tis time enough to tell the plot.O, but that's true, I'd like to have forgot,The dresses—'Pon my conscience in my daysI never saw their peer, they're all a blaze.Then there's a child, the sweetest little rogue—Only excuse a trifling spice of brogue—He'll make you cry your eyes out, I'll be bound—'Tis Ireland is the true poetic ground.The Muses—Phoebus, heath'nish cant I loath!What's Mount Parnassus to the Hill of Howth?Or all the scenes each foolish poet paints—O bub bub-boo! give me the Isle of Saints.Turn up your noses, cavil now and carp—Musha, I'm sure our emblem is the harp.But stop, the bell rings. Fait they'll soon begin;'Tis time for me to be a going in.I take my lave then—but dear craters mind—Pray to our Irish poetry be kind:'Tis a new manufacture in effect—And yours, my sowls t' encourage and protect;No critic custom then exacted be,Pass it like Irish linen, duty free.EPILOGUE, Spoken by Mrs. DANCER.THIS virgin author's such a blushing rogue—What! no gay, lively, laughing epilogue!"Madam (says he, and look'd so wise) in Greece"—(Greece; that's their cant) "no jesting clos'd the piece."Play, epilogue and all were grave and solemn"—Then, Sir, the town were fools that did not mawl 'em.No—let your heroine, in this laughing age,Come thus (as Bayes says) souse upon the stage;Then with a jaunty air, half smile, half grin,Curtsey quite round the boxes, and begin.A spark from court, and no one to detect him!A pretty fellow too, and yet reject him!—Now, Ladies, let me die but it was silly—You'll not approve such horrid prudery—will ye?—I shou'd have bless'd the occasion, and receiv'd him!He shou'd have kneel'd and vow'd, and I—believ'd him;Laugh'd, danc'd and sported it till spouse came over,Then kiss'd my dear—while Betty hid my lover.But here again our Poet checks my flight,"Nay, Madam, you mistake the matter quite."My heroine liv'd in ancient, honest times;"Cards were unknown, and gallantries were crimes"—'Psha! what if females then were seldom rovers?Husbands—(aye, there's the cause) were warm as lovers.Their warlike days indeed were spent in killing;But then, at night—no turtles were so billing.Well—tho' he gives me no smart things to say,I wish this begging face may save his play:The thing may mend, and learn to please you better—Do then—nay, pray you shew him some good nature.Persons of the Drama.Alwin, Mr. Barry.Raymond, Mr. T.

SCENE I.An Avenue leading to a Gothic Castle.Enter GREY, and FIRST KNIGHT.GREY.A Messenger dispatch'd by lady Salisbury!KNIGHT.And in the specious guise he wore, had pass'dUnquestion'd, had not I, in happy season,Approach'd, even as th' unwary centinelsHalf op'd the gate. By threats o'eraw'd in part,In part thro' hope of favour won, he own'd,At length, by whom employed, whither bent,And for what purpose.GREY.Say—KNIGHT.Strait to repairTo Marlborough; where now, as fame reports,Our king resides, with all his peers; and there
To seek the lord de Warren; to what endThis paper will, as I suppose, inform you—I was about to bear it to lord Raymond.GREY.That care be mine. Henceforward it concernsUs near, our vigilance be doubly firm.[Exit KNIGHT.GREY reads.The countess of SALISBURY, to her illustrious Friend, the lord de WARREN.I have lost my husband—Me and my lands lord Raymond claims, as by royal grant assigned to him. He has banished my train, encompassed me with his creatures, and holds me a prisoner in my own castle. If the memory of thy noble friend be dear to thee, haste and rescue the afflictedELA.How near was Raymond's hope, the beauteous hopeHe tended with unceasing care, how nearMy rsing fortunes marr'd—I like not this:Her, and her rich domains he wou'd possess;Yet in his breast there lives that kind of heartWithholds him from the path that's nearest—He,That wou'd be great, must first be bold.I hate those motley'd characters;Something, I know not what, 'twixt good and ill,Yet neither absolute: all good, all illFor me—That day, saith he, that happy day,Which sees the countess mine, shall amply payThy services: a doubtful balance thisWhereon my fortunes hang—This way he moves;And, by his gait and gesture, ill at ease—We must be firm;
My hopes demand it, and the time admitsNo weak, no scrupulous delay—Enter RAYMOND.RAYMOND.To sue,But ever without grace to sue—oh Grey!I am even weary of the vain pursuit.GREY.It is, in truth, my lord, an irksome labour.RAYMOND.But now I cast me at the fair one's feet;Pleaded my passion with whatever artsMight best the gentle purpose aid; but she,Instead of such return as I might hope,Repaid me with an eye of cold contempt.Of her late gallant lord she spoke; his meritsIn opposition hateful plac'd to mine.Urg'd, then, with recollection of her wrongs,Like the loud torrent, with steep winter rainsO'ercharg'd, in all the loose, ungovern'd swayOf wrath and indignation, she assail'd me.GREY.And did my lord, in this unseemly fashion,Hear all with equal temper? Wak'd he notWith such a peal?RAYMOND.Thou know'st not what it isTo love like me—Long time (for passion nowHad shed o'er all her charms a brighter glow,That like Jove's daughter most she look'd, severeIn youthful beauty) long I lay, o'eraw'dAnd silenc'd as by some superior being;Till wak'd by pride, quick from the floor I sprung;
Warn'd her how she provok'd my power;'Twas great, 'twas now within these walls supreme:I long had gently woo'd her, but that love,Tho' patient, would not always brook disdain.GREY.'Twas well: and what ensu'd?RAYMOND.Silence at first,Then tears; bright drops, like May-morn dews that fallFrom the sweet blossom'd thorn. Back in her chairShe sunk—Oh! had you seen her then, dissolv'dIn all the soft, the lovely languishmentOf woe; while at her knee, with countenanceMost piteous stood her beauteous boy, and look'dAs if each tear, which from his mother fell,Wou'd force a passage to his little heart—I fled; else had I kneel'd, and wept myselfAs well as she.GREY.O shame to manhood!—suitsSuch weakness with our hopes?RAYMOND.She must, she must,Yes, Grey, she must be mine—and yet—yet fainWou'd I persuade the fair one, not compel.GREY.Say to what purpose then was seizd her castle?When she your suit rejected, then perforceTo claim her as the gift of royal favour!To lord it here so long, and now to falter—My lord, my lord, the mound is overleapt,What now forbids but without further pauseTo crop the rich, the golden fruits within?RAYMOND.Ungracious is the love reluctance yields;And cold, cold even as marble is the maid,Who comes unwilling to another's arms.GREY.In brief, would you partake the lady's bed?RAYMOND.What means the question?GREY.Look on that, my lord:Better reluctant come, than not at all.RAYMOND.—How came this to your hand?GREY.By one whose caresOf thee demand no trivial recompence.His wakeful eye it was descry'd the bearer;Else had the watch with all their vigilanceProv'd insufficient.RAYMOND.My better angel interpos'd.GREY.Had this it's purpos'd scope attain'd—my lord,Were this but whisper'd in our Henry's ear—He gave the royal nod you say: true, hePermitted, but thus far; that you should wooThe lady, and her choice approving, wed;No more. By us the public ear is toldShe hath approv'd: our artifice hath spreadThe rumour; and with some it is receiv'dThat she is now your full-espoused consort:But truth, my lord, long cannot rest conceal'd;
It will abroad, of that be sure, in spiteOf all our studied wiles.RAYMOND.What's to be done?GREY.'Tis critical; and must be manag'd nicely—But see, with Eleanor the countess comes;And in her hand the young lord William. HereHer custom is to walk: retire we now;And thou observe the counsels of a friend.[Exeunt ambo.]Enter Lady SALISBURY, Lord WILLIAM, ELEANOR.Lady SALISBURY.Talk'st thou of patience? What! the very roof,That shou'd protect and shelter me, becomeMy prison! Aw'd, and threatened, as I am,By this intruder!—Cruel destiny!Had I not more than common griefs before?ELEANOR.In evil hour thy hospitable gatesWere open'd to receive him.Lady SALISBURY.Unguarded that I was!—But who could thenForesee the purpose of his coming?ELEANOR.WhoCan think even yet, that once repuls'd, he e'erWou'd thus presume?Lady SALISBURY.Is there no succour then?No generous hand to vindicate my wrongs?—
Oh Salisbury! Salisbury! why, if yet thou liv'st—Fond hope! he lives not, else with speed of thoughtWould he repair to his afflicted Ela.ELEANOR.Why, dearest lady, will you yield you upA prey to purpos'd sorrow? Time is fruitful;And the next hour perhaps may bring thee comfort.Lady SALISBURY.Day after day I have watch'd the joyless hours;Night after night, when some fleet courier sentBefore perchance, or letter fraught with sweetAssurance of his safety might appear;Five tedious moons have pass'd since first were toldThe dismal tidings; no fleet courier sentBefore, alas! nor letter with such sweetAssurance vet appears—He's gone, he's lost!And I shall never, never see him more.ELEANOR.Ah! suffer not the leaden hand of coldDespair thus weigh thee down; I yet have hope—Lady SALISBURY.Away with hope, away. No, no; full loud,As I remember, and outrageous blewThe storm, that even the solid fabric shookOf yonder walls; deep-rooted oaks gave way;Churches and spires were overturn'd; nor evenThe peasant's humble roof escap'd that hour.The flet, save only one, one luckless ship,Have all return'd; my lord nor hath been seen,Alas! nor ever heard of since the storm.ELEANOR.Heaven visit her affliction, and bestowThat patience which she needs.Lady SALISBURY.No, Eleanor: no more shall heTo these deserted walls return. No moreShall trophies, won by many a gallant deed,Thro' the long hall in proud procession move;No more fair Salisbury's battlements and towersRe-echo to th' approaching trumpet's voice.Never, oh! never more shall Ela runWith throbbing bosom at the well-known sound,T' unlock his helmet, conquest plum'd, to stripThe cuishes from his manly thigh, or snatchQuick from his breast the plated armour, wontT' oppose my fond embrace—Sweet times farewel,These tender offices are now no more.Lord WILLIAM.Mother, why do you speak so? You make me sad.Lady SALISBURY.It is too soon, my child, for thee to knowWhat sadness is.Lord WILLIAM.Will not my father come home soon? Eleanor told me he wou'd: she wou'd not tell a lye.Lady SALISBURY.No, love.Lord WILLIAM.Then he will come.Lady SALISBURY.Sweet innocence! I fear he will not.Lord WILLIAM.I hope he is not sick.Lady SALISBURY.—Go, lovely pratler, seek thy toys; go, go.Lord WILLIAM.I will, good mother; but don't be sad, or I shall be so too.[Exit.Lady SALISBURY.Sweet state of childhood! unallay'd with cares;Serene as spring-tide morn, new welcom'd upWith bleat of lamb, with note of woodlark wild.With riper years come passions turbulentAnd rude, a baleful crew, unnumber'd asThe forest leaves that strew the earth in autumn.When happiness is round thee, when thou art onThe lap of downy ease, when thou art cherish'dIn the fair bosom of unruffl'd joy,Comes a fell hand, dashes thee rudely down,And leaves thee to despair.ELEANOR.Cease,Cease, lady, to afflict thee: Raymond may,I trust he will, e'er long retire, and giveThee ease again—But hither comes his minion:Much with his lord he can; and, as he lists,To purposes of good or ill o'er-rulesHis mind: if he accost thee, speak him gently.Enter GREY.As you are fair above all other women,So may you lend to that I would imploreA gracious ear.Lady SALISBURY.Without more preface, briefly speak thy suit.GREY.To love, but ne'er to reap of love the sweetReturns, is sure the worst of ills,Lady SALISBURY.And what of that?GREY.Tho' love denied, yet pity may do muchTo soothe the wound that beauty gives—In brief,Thou much-rever'd! my suit is in behalf of Raymond.Lady SALISBURY.Then I will spare us both some costOf words—In brief, I love him not, nor pity:So tell thy lord—I would be private—hence.GREY.Your words are brief indeed; but of that kindI dare not, must not bear my lord.Lady SALISBURY.Must not!GREY.'Tis cruel toward the man who loves so fondly.Lady SALISBURY.Doth he assume the specious name of love?Love is a bright, a generous quality,Heaven gave to noble minds; pure, and unmix'dWith every grosser stuff; a goodly flower,Shoots up and blossoms in great souls alone.GREY.The mind, th' exalted soul thou nam'st, is his.Lives there a youth more gentle of condition,In fair accomplishments more grac'd, admir'd?
If beauty sway thy fond regards, if wealth,I know not in fair England one with himCan vie.Lady SALISBURY.Is then the star, the peerless star,That late was gaz'd on, quite obscur'd? What tho'He may have set, hath he not left a trainOf glory in the skies?—Th' illustrious nameOf Salisbury yet survives—If wealth—but mark me;Were he of all the wealth possess'd from whereTh' East Indian bids the sun good-morrow, to whereTh' Atlantic in her wide-extended lapReceives him setting; cou'd he in each handA thousand sceptres place, not all shou'd bribeMe to his bed—No, Salisbury! thou hast beenThe husband of my early love; with thee,That love was all interr'd; and when I pluckIt forth again, gape wide that earth whereinThou liest, quick snatch me from the light of Heaven,And swallow me within her lowest prison!GREY.For pity's sake yet soften; for, oh sureNo former love could ever equal this;No bosom boast the generous flame wherewithLord Raymond glows for thee, admired fair!Lady SALISBURY.Hear this, ye Heavens, and grant me patience,—where'sMy people? where the freedom that I lateWas blest with? Wherefore is my palace throng'dWith strangers? Why, why are my gates shut upAnd fortified against their rightful mistress?GREY.Madam—Lady SALISBURY.Is this the love he boasts?Is this the fair-accomplish'd, this the gentle youth?Must I recall to mind—Came he not thenEven while the memory of my dear lov'd lordWas green; while sorrow yet was in mine eyes?—Tears! ye will choak me—Came he not even then,And broke in on my sorrows? Like a spoilerHe came, heap'd up the measure of my woes,Added new anguish to th' afflicted heart,And swell'd the current of the widow's tears.GREY.Madam, where he that spoiler thou proclaim'st,He need not now thus humbly sue for thatHis power long since, unask'd might have extorted.Lady SALISBURY.Ha!—what art thou that thus presum'st to threaten?Extorted!—Hence thou rude one, bolder evenThan him who calls thee slave.GREY.Madam you speakAs though you knew me not.Lady SALISBURY.I know thee well—To what concerns lord Raymond I have spoke,My final purpose fix'd:For thee, I charge thee shun my presence; hence,And learn the distance that befits thy calling.GREY.Not ere I speak more fully to the cause—Nay, lady, look not on me with so sternAn eye, but give me patient hearing—Lady SALISBURY.No more; I'll hear no more.GREY.Not hear!—When next we meet—I will be heard.[Exit.]Lady SALISBURY.What meant he, Eleanor?—I will be heard.ELEANOR.Alas! I know not: but a soul he hath,Prompt and alert to acts of desperate thinking.Hardly thou art beset; O lady, lendAn ear to what thy Eleanor would counsel.When next he come (for that he hath obtain'dOf Raymond leave to woo thee to his will,I know) assume a gentler carriage. SeemAs tho' you may hereafter to his suitIncline. Be rul'd: necessity oft lendsA sanction to deceit. Demand a pause:My lord of Salisbury's fate yet unconfirm'dShall add thereto a seeming colour. Chance,Mean time, that comes or soon or late to all,To thee may come with unexpected succour.Lady SALISBURY.—Sincerity,Thou spotless as the snowy-vested hill,Forgive me, if by lawless power constrain'd,I turn this once from thy long-trodden path;It must be so—Oh Salisbury! Salisbury! thou lamented shade!Descend from those pure mansions, where thou sitstExalted; hover o'er me; and as thouWert wont, support me in this hour of trial.[Exeunt ambo.]END OF THE FIRST ACT.ACT II.SCENE within the Castle.Enter RAYMOND and GREY.GREY.AWAY, my lord, away with every care;The conflict's past, and fortune is our own—Defeated once, again I sought the fair;I sought her, and prevail'd.RAYMOND.By all the joys, the nameless joys, that onThe precious hour of soft compliance wait,I will requite thee nobly. Say, for muchMy wonder's mov'd, how hast thou foundSuch grace? how wrought this change, thus sudden thus,Unhop'd from her late bearing?GREY.Uncertain is the sex—but that imports not.It now remains, that proof, such proof be soughtOf Salisbury's fate, as by minute detailOf circumstance shall with the lady gainPrompt credence—Hear what I have devis'd, if youApprove—Enter a KNIGHT.KNIGHT.My lord, two strangers I have brought,Within the precincts of the castle found.RAYMOND.Say'st thou? two strangers? of what quality?KNIGHT.With me they were of speech not over-prompt;But by their outward guise they wou'd seem menAs with some pious purpose charg'd. SevereThe younger seems, but of excelling form;And wishes to recruit his wearied limbsBeneath the friendly covert of this roof.RAYMOND.Conduct them to our presence— [Exit KNIGHT.] I were loth,The weary traveller to dismiss my gates,Unhospitably rude; yet none I wish,While we are yet suspended at the nodOf peevish and uncertain chance, approachThese walls.Re-enter KNIGHT, with STRANGERS.Whence, and what are you?FIRST STRANGER.What we are,These weeds, tho' we were silent, might unfold.Alwin I am call'd, my fellow-travellerLeroches. Our way was bent for Canterbury,With purpose of a pious vow: o'erta'enBy weariness from travel, and desireOf food, we journey'd hitherward, in hopeThe lord of these fair turrets, first descry'dAt close of evening, might befriend our toils.RAYMOND.Whence have you come?ALWIN.From France, not many days.RAYMOND.Say, what occasion may have call'd you thither?ALWIN.To aid (Heav'n prosper long) my country's weal.RAYMOND.You ara a soldier then?ALWIN.I have been such;And to be such was my most dear inclining;Smit with the love, even from my greenest youth,Of honest arms. Some share of fame I tooAtchiev'd—But ill the soldier it beseemsTo trumpet his own praises.RAYMOND.Cease not so.Tho' in the school of war untutour'd, muchIt pleaseth me to hear the brave man's labours.ALWIN.None but have heard how some time since was sent(To claim of Lewis certain lands usurp'd)A puissant force—RAYMOND.Were you therein employed?ALWIN.Beneath the royal banner I enroll'd,As was my bent, in quest of fame.RAYMOND.Indeed!Lord Salisbury then perchance of thee was known?ALWIN.I knew him well; our liege's near ally,And second to duke Richard in command.Fast by his side was my allotted postUpon the marshal'd field: by him I fought,For him had died.RAYMOND.Of him fame loudly speaks,That in those wars he was a gallant man.ALWIN.He was not wont, while others bravely fought,To look unactive on.LEROCHES.A foe like himFrance never knew, of all that warriour host,Which like an inundation England pour'dOn her affrighted shores—RAYMOND.But whatHave prov'd his latter fortunes I shou'd wishTo learn—Say, courteous stranger, if thou canst.Of this renowned lord a rumour hathLong since prevail'd, that he on Gallia's coastWas wreck'd with all his crew.ALWIN.What cause there wasFor such report, alas! these eyes have seen;How true in part it is, too sure this tongueCan testify.RAYMOND.I pray you let us hear.ALWIN.—O'ercharg'd with human prey, fell war had ceas'dTo walk his wasteful round; well pleas'd we turnUs from the blood-stain'd field; exulting eachWith some rich spoil, trophies by valiant dintOf arms atchiev'd. Forthwith the eager hostEmbark.And now the chalky cliffs on Albion's coastT' our straining view appear'd; th' exulting crewWith peals redoubled greet the well known shores—Ill-fated men!—in vain the anxious dameOft mounts the high-rais'd tower, thence earnest looksHaply if her wish'd for lord may come; in vainThe prattling boy oft asks her of his sire,That never, never shall return.RAYMOND.Proceed,Good stranger; what was the event?ALWIN.AnonThe winds began to shift; up rose a stormAnd heav'd the bosom of the troubled deep.On the swoln billow sits enthron'd grim Death,And shakes his fatal dart—The fleet, which lateIn such fair order sail'd, is now dispers'd.Before the wind we drove, left to the mercyOf the wild waves, and all-disposing Heaven—Oh my lov'd friends! associates of my toils!Rescu'd in vain from War's wide-wasteful arm,Here end your labours; here sweet life forsakes you.For me, a slender plank, next to the handOf some good angel, bore me to the shore.Of full five hundred gallant lives, which lateEmbark'd, not one that fatal hour surviv'd.RAYMOND.Save only thee.ALWIN.Save only me.RAYMOND.Speak now secure, for nearly it concernsMy quiet, speak—was, Salisbury of your crew?ALWIN.Alas! too sure.RAYMOND.Enough—Thy courtesyOf us may well, and shall be well requited.Of this our friend accept mean time his promptRegards; anon we shall be glad to holdSome further converse with you.[Exit ALW. LERO. and KNIGHT.GREY.Of this strangerWhat thinks my lord?RAYMOND.As of an angel, sentTo waft me on his wings strait to the summitOf all my wishes—With what a gallant graceHe bears him!—Much I wish to hear him speakAgain; to hear the battles he has fought,And all the story of his life and fortunes.GREY.That we shall learn hereafter: but 'tis meetThat he to lady Salisbury first unfoldThe sum of what he hath reported.RAYMOND.MethinksI now behold her, like some full-blown flower,The fairest of the garden, late o'ercharg'dWith showers, her head declining sad, whilst heRecounts the story of her Salisbury's fate.Wou'd she were mine without a tear;Without a sigh!—But she must weep; she must;Thereon my all depends—Oh wayward sorrow!That wounds, yet wounding heals the lover.[Ex. amb.Scene changes—Lady SALISBURY reclining on a couch.Enter ELEANOR.ELEANOR.Grief, that of time's fix'd periods for reposeTakes small account, hath lull'd her wearied senses—Where'er thou dwell'st, O Peace, with azure eyeSerene; or if in stately-structur'd dome,Or thatch-roof'd cottage low, or in cool grotBy fountain clear thou sitt'st, or if perchanceAlong the silver brook's green liveried vergeReclin'd, approach thou rosy-dimpled fair;Leave thy sweet haunts a while; and with that balmWhich so ths the woe-struck heart, await her slumbers.The hour approaches, when, as is her custom,She seeks the hallow'd shrine, and pious wakesThe voice of pure devotion to high heaven:I'll thither, and expect her—but she wakes—How fares the mistress of my best regards?Proved her slumbers sweet as were my wishes?Lady SALISBURY.Sweet, sweet, my Fleanor, so sweet, oh! wou'dI ne'er had wak'd. I dreamt, as wont on himTo dream, that I beheld his gracious form,My bosom's lord; a while he stood, and seem'dOn me to smile; then flew to my embraces.—Ah fleeting extacy! 'twas but a dream:Enter a KNIGHT.KNIGHT.Thy favour, lady; I am charg'd with news,That much imports thy hearing: summon upThy powers; two strangers late have come, of whomOne brings assured tidings of thy lord.Lady SALISBURY.—My lord—what—speak—KNIGHT.He saith he knew my lordOf Salisbury well; that he was of his crew;And with that peer embark'd from France.Lady SALISBURY.—But—well—from France—KNIGHT.Lady, all must haveTheir sorrows. Strait up rose a mighty tempest,Dispers'd the fleet o'er all the seas—The storm—the fatal wreck—of allThe stranger gives most circumstantial proof.[Exit.]ELEANOR.Alas the tidings!—Dearest lady, giveThy sorrows vent; thy bosom's overfraught,And will find ease by letting loose its woes.Lady SALISBURY.—Well, well—Then he is lost, and all, all is despair.Tho' languid, yet was hope not quite extinct—Where, where's the stranger? Seek him, haste; that IMay hear him fully speak of all. [Ex. Knt.] Methinks'Twill be a desperate sort of soothing; to hangUpon each sound, catch every circumstanceOf the sad story, and wring my aching heartTill I am even surfeited with sorrow.ELRANOR.Behold, the stranger comes—Enter ALWIN.Lady SALISBURY.Bear, bear me up, good Heaven!That I may give full measure to my sorrow.ALWIN.—Thy angel hover o'er thee, and support thee.[In an under voice.]Lady SALISBURY.—The dead ere nowHave burst the prisons of the close pent grave,And apparitions strange of faith appear'd;Perhaps thou too art but a shadow; letMe grasp thee, for, as I have life, I think—It is, it is my Salisbury! O my lord!Lord SALISBURY.My bosom's joy!Lady SALISBURY.—And dost thou live indeed?Amazing Providence! He does! he does!
Look! look! behold him, Eleanor! beholdThe gracious form! the vision was not vain.[Eleanor goes aside.]Lord SALISBURY.—And art thou, art thou then—Lady SALISBURY.—O my full bosom!LORD SALISBURY.The same, by time or circumstance unchang'd?Lady SALISBURY.Unhop'd reverse!—Hence, hence all former woes—My lord! my life! hence, hence, be swallow'd upAll griefs, and lost in this most blissful hour.Lord SALISBURY.Thou art, I see, thou art the same, thou must;Thou hast not yielded to another lord?Lady SALISBURY.Another lord!—And cou'd you, did you think'Twas so?Lord SALISBURY.Thus spoke loud rumour on my way:Indeed I scarce cou'd think it.Lady SALISBURY.Oh! 'twas foul!Indeed thou shoud'st not think it—Lord SALISBURY.Ever dear!No more; my soul is satisfied, and thinksOf nothing now but happiness and thee.Lady SALISBURY.Say then, thou wanderer—Oh! I have muchOf thee to ask, thou much to hear: how is'tI see thee, see the thus? Where hast thou been?What secret region hath so long detain'd thee?Lord SALISBURY.O thou! whose image, ever in my view,Sustain'd me angel-like against the roughAnd rapid current of adversity,Shou'd I recount the story of my fortunes,Each circumstance, beginning from that dayWe parted, to this hour, thine ear wou'd beFatigu'd; the stars, ere I had ended, ceaseTo twinkle, and the morning's sun break inUpon th' unfinish'd tale; suffice it theeTo know the summ.For England we embark'd, when, black and foul,A tempest rising, quick upturn'd the seas,And cast me forth upon an hostile shore.Why need I tell thee, love, how, in disguise,On foot, alone, I've toil'd my weary way,Thro' dreary vale, o'er mountain wild; my bedOft of the blasted heath, whilst o'er my limbsDank night hath shaken her cold, dewy wings,And the chill northern gale hath spent his breathOn my defenceless head?Thro' what variety of strange eventsI've come, Heaven-guided, to behold, once more,My wife?—But, ah! my son! our only hope!My boy! what, what of him?Lady SALISBURY.Dear to these eyesAs is the new-born light of Heaven! he lives;Is well—But say, my lord, what would thy coming,Thus unattended, thus disguised!Lord SALISBURY.How I escap'd from had captivity,And Gallia's coast, more leisure shall inform you.My friend sir Ardolf had but just embrac'd me,(The first glad transports of our meeting o'er)When, with an honest tear, the good old manIn brief disclos'd what fame had now reported;That thou wert soon, or had'st, ere this, espous'dEarl Hubert's nephew, and sole purpos'd heir—Lady SALISBURY.Oh most unhallow'd, thus t'abuseMy unattainted love!—And cou'd my lord—Lord SALISBURY.Yet hear me—Strait I grasp'd my sword;And, single as I was, had sallied forth,Had not my friend's sage counsels interpos'd.By Ardolf sway'd, I veil'd me as thou see'st;And, with a sharer in the dark intent,Set forward on my way for Sal'sbury castle:A simple hind's low cottage, not far hence,Receiv'd us. Here, fast by the green-wood side,We lodg'd; resolv'd, ourselves unknown, to proveWhat doubtful rumour only had proclaim'd.With this intent, at dusk of evening, weForsook the cot—Lady SALISBURY.There needs no more: Heaven sawMe, and was touch'd with pity—What a changeThis hour! Sequester'd as I was, even likeThe votarist; perhaps the destin'd preyOf rude desire—Lord SALISBURY.O for to-morrow's slow-returning night!Lady SALISBURY.Say, what of that, my lord?Lord SALISBURY.Revenge, revenge!I'll tell thee—Soon as dark usurping nightShall chace to morrow's sun adown the skies,Know, Ardolf, with a chosen troop of friends,To that same cottage, arm'd shall come—Enter ELEANOR.ELEANOR.My lord, I hear th' approach of hasty steps.Lord SALISBURY.Farewel, my best:Nor peace nor sleep shall visit me, till IHave given thee freedom, and reveng'd our wrongs.Enter a KNIGHT.KNIGHT.Lord Raymond, sir, forthwith expects your coming.Lord SALISBURY.I will attend him. Lady, fain wou'd IHave told thee less ungracious things; but allHave their appointed trials. Learn to bear;Convinc'd, the hand Heaven, when it inflicts,Prepares us oft for some superior good.[Exeunt omnes.END OF THE SECOND ACT.ACT III.SCENE within the Castle.Enter RAYMOND and GREY.RAYMOND.I SEE nor cause my joys to check, nor boastAs yet securely.GREY.Think, that Hope, the young,The merry-minded fair, exalts us oft,To make our fall the greater.RAYMOND.Why this cold,This prudent maxim?—GREY.Mark the wary falcon;Forward he shoots his piercing eye, and kensThe quarry from afar; like his be thine—Perhaps, my lord, mine are but nicer fears,Wak'd in a heart o'er anxious of thy welfare;Yet hath the younger of those strangers rais'dIn me suspicions of alarming hue,Lest, underneath this honest guise, there lurkSome subtle mischief. Lady Salisbury saw him:Their conference, as 'twas long, so was it heldIn secret; wou'd we had been present.RAYMOND.GrantingOur presence had been seemly, wherefore spokeYou not this counsel ere they met?GREY.I saw not then the danger.His honest carriage, and the recent changeWithin her mind had lull'd each nicer fear.RAYMOND.'Till now unmov'd, say what hath wak'd suspicion?GREY.I know not well—wou'd she were firmly thine,Beyond the reach and grasp of wayward fortune.The knight, whose office was to introduceHim to the countess, he dismiss'd ere theyApproach'd th' apartment.RAYMOND.Indeed!GREY.This, too—Is it not strange, tho' night, and thisThy proffer'd roof, invited his sojourn,He wou'd not wait th' approach of morning?RAYMOND.Are they gone?GREY.Amid th' unguarded joyWhich held us, they escap'd unheeded.Enter SECOND KNIGHT.KNIGHT.My lord,Two strangers, it is said, in Palmer's weeds
Attir'd, have lodg'd since morning in a hut;You may have mark'd it in the darksome glen,Near to the forest of wild oaks, just whereThe stream white rushes down the shelving cliff.RAYMOND.Since morning say'st thou?KNIGHT.Further I have learn'd,Their guise, as doth appear from certain wordsO'erheard, is borrow'd with design to maskSome secret purpose.[Exit.]GREY.It must be so;Their close-concerted arts have foil'd our caution.RAYMOND.They scarce have measur'd half the precincts yet,Send forth my knights, we will pursue them.GREY.No: one way there is, and onl one—But hence,I hear the countess—She loves lord William well;And much, much will a pious mother sure,To save an only son.[Exeunt ambo.]Enter Lady SALISBURY and ELEANOR.Lady SALISBURY.In spite of this event, this blest event,That hath restor'd the lord of this fond bosom,Yet is my mind with doubts and fears disturb'd;With images and wild conceits, of formUnsightly; such as hover oft in dreamsAbout the curtains of the sick—Alas!Whilst others joy within the friendly roof,Of night regardless and the storm that beats
Without, he struggles hard; or hies at bestTo the dank shelter of the dripping wood.Besides what unknown perils may assail him,Unnaided thus against whatever ill—Wou'd he had waited the return of morn.ELEANOR.The night is dark indeed, the tempest high;But hear me, lady, hear a pious lesson,Which thy own lips to me have oft repeated:There is a Power unseen, whose charge it is,With ever wakeful eye to watch the good;And peaceful ever is that breast, which trustsIn his angelic guard—The handOf Heaven, that hitherto hath been his shield,Will minister safe convoy to his steps,Tho' night and darkness shed their thickest gloom.Lady SALISBURY.Misdeem not of my fears; or think I speak,As over diffident of that same powerThou nam'st, whose all surveying eye wakes ever;Clear, unobstructed, either when the sunShrowds in night's shadowy veil, or when at noonHe shines reveal'd on his meridian throne.But where's the bosom throbs not, if it hope?Hope ever is attended with a trainOf wakeful doubts; and where the sweet nymph harbours,There flutters also her pale sister Fear—But hence, as was our purpose, to the shrine;Where, as is meet, for my dear lord restor'dI will with grateful adoration—Enter Lord WILLIAM.Lord WILLIAM.Mother—I fain would know that stranger, who he is that just now met me.Lady SALISBURY.And wherefore would'st thou know him, love?Lord WILLIAM.Gentle he was, and mild, not like those grimfac'd ones I see here every day: and such kind things he did, as make me love him dearly.Lady SALISBURY.Say, what were they?Lord WILLIAM.He kiss'd me, strok'd my head, and patted me upon the cheek, and said—Lady SALISBURY.What said, he, sweet?Lord WILLIAM.He said—Heaven bless thy beauteous head, sweet boy!Enter GREY.GREY.Permit me, honour'd dame, I have a wordOr two, that claims thine ear.Lady SALISBURY.Then but a word;My present cares ill brook long interruption.GREY.Behold the blossom of the spring, how fair!Yet in his velvet bosom lurks the worm,And hourly wastes him of his choicest sweets;Not less a foe is slow-consuming griefTo beauty—You may remember when we last conferr'dThe gracious purport of your words to what
Concern'd lord Raymond, when you taught his suitTo hope a prosperous issue; thus by me he speaks:In the recesses of the hallow'd shrine,Where with him stands the sable-vested priest,He waits thy coming; there with pious vowsExchang'd even now to consecrate thee his.May every rose lip'd son of light look down,And smile propitious on the joyful hour!Lady SALISBURY.Is this a season meet for a such a theme?GREY.For gracious acts all seasons should be meet;Heaven shews the bright example; ever promptT' incline when virtue lifts her suppliant eye.But say, that for the present he forboreHis earnest suit, say, shall tomorrow makeHim happy? or tomorrow's night perchance?Or—what shall be the bright succeeding day?Lady SALISBURY.I know not: nor will I submit me orTo promis'd league or tye; no, tho' thou shouidst pleadEven with an angel's tongue.GREY.You will not, lady!Know then—this night, this hour must make thee his.Lady SALISBURY.This night! this hour! who'll make me his this hour?GREY.A power, my lady, thou shalt learn to fear:Force, force superior, that with giant handPlucks e'en the monarch from his throne; disrobes
The virgin of her honour, while distressWith streaming eyes and loose dishevel'd hairHolds forth her supplicating hands in vain.Lady SALISBURY.I know the monster thou woud'st fright me with,But I despise his power—Hast thou ne'er heard?Learn then of me a truth, a golden truth,Grav'd on the register of hoary Time:Virtue, with her own native strength upheld,Can brave the shock of ruffian force, unmov'dAs is the rock, whose firm-set base not allThe tumult of the western surge can shake,Tho' the fierce winds uplift him to the stars.GREY.This is a truth indeed may hold a placeOn fancy's tinsel page, what will availThy virtue's boasted powers when thou shalt seeTorn from thy feeble arms all thou hold'st dear?Yes, lady, thy lord William, thy lov'd son.Lady SALISBURY.—Ha! save him Heaven!—He dare not sure—and yet—GREY.Think, lady, think upon thy son.Lady SALISBURY.ProtectHim, O ye powers celestial, angels watchHis steps, and hover round his harmless head!GREY.Say, will you to the altar, lady?Lady SALISBURY.Sooner to my grave.GREY.Thy obstinacy on his head—Who waits?Enter a RUFFIAN.Lady SALISBURY.What would'st thou here? Hence, execrable wretch!Thou mak'st my blood run cold.Lord WILLIAM.Oh mother! I am frighten'd.Lady SALISBURY.Dearest lamb!Hast thou no terrors for thyself?—Oh Salisbury!—Hast thou no fears?—Oh! I cou'd tell thee whatLike thunder wou'd apal thy hearing, shrinkUp every nerve within thy blasted frame,And make thee nothing—Fear not, love.GREY.Think notWith empty sounds to shake our purpose, say,Will you comply?Lady SALISBURY.My little innocent!Thou dar'st not, fell as is thy nature—my love!My life!GREY.Convey lord William hence.Lord WILLIAM.Oh! save me, mother, save me.Lady SALISBURY.Forbear your impious hands, forbear.GREY.Or to the altar, or by all thereinI swear, this moment wrests him from thy view.Lady SALISBURY.In human that thou art! can nothing moveThee?—Oh! those little harmless looks wou'd preachEven to the hungry lion, make him pause,And turn his rage to pity.GREY.Nay, madam—Lady SALISBURY.Forbear, and I will go,—whither?Distraction! I will rouseThe castle—help—my cries shall tear the roofs.Help, help, Oh help!—the mother and the son▪GREY.Your cries are vain—Enter Lord SALISBURY.Lord SALISBURY.Hold!—what is't ye do?GREY.He here again!Lord SALISBURY.Speak, lady, would these men have wrong'd thee?Pale fear is on thy cheek—[Eleanor removes lord William. Exit Grey and Ruffian.]Lady SALISBURY.Cold horror hath o'ercome me.Lord SALISBURY.Ever lov'd!Sure thou wert sore distress'd, I heard thee cry.Lady SALISBURY.Ah sore distress'd indeed! the hand of perilWas on me; violence and murder star'dMe full in all their hideous forms!Lord SALISBURY.Gracious powers! my fear, my fear, new-wak'dFor thee it was, as Heaven decreed, that urg'dMe back, and brought me to thy timely rescue.Lady SALISBURY.'Twas Heaven indeed that brought thee hither now!Yet I have wonderous fears: thou art but oneSurrounded by a legion of those fiends.Enter RAYMOND, GREY and armed KNIGHTS.RAYMOND.Where is the audacious man that hath presum'dTo question with such bold intrusion?Lord SALISBURY.If him you meanWho took the part of feeble innocenceAgainst the ruffian's arm,—he's here.RAYMOND.Which of you, slaves have suffer'd him to enter?KNIGHT.My lord, he bad us to unbar the gates,Driven by the tempest, as he said, to seekThe proffer'd shelter he had late declin'd:Pardon, if deeming him your honour'd guest,We answer'd him with prompt compliance.RAYMOND.Say what dark purpose is't hath brought thee hither?Confess thee true, or by the blessed SaintsThou shalt have cause to mourn the hour which mov'dThee, daring as thou art, t' approach our castle.Lord SALISBURY.To other regions, other climes with threatsLike these, where proud oppression lords it: hereThe free-born subject knows not what it isTo be in awe of arbitrary power.RAYMOND.I will know what thou art.Lord SALISBURY.Even what thou seestAm I; a man not prompt to offer wrong,Yet of that frame, I brook not to beholdA noble lady made the prey of ruffians.RAYMOND.Intruder bold as thou art officious! whereforeShould'st thou concern thee in this lady's cause?Lord SALISBURY.The cause of innocence should be the causeOf all—Confess thee, lord, was't nobly done,To let those bold, those rude assailants loose,And give a sanction to such foul proceedings?RAYMOND.Pilgrim, hast thou forgot thee? Who am I?Lord SALISBURY.Who art thou! Ask, ask thy deeds,And they will answer. The breath of fame hath told
How base they have been; they are gone abroad,And the pure air is tainted with their foulness.RAYMOND.Presuming slave! whoe'er thou art, for thyUnlicenc'd bearing dearly shalt thou answer.Hence with the bold defamer; bind him fast;Be instant death his lot should he resist—Seize him, I say.Lady SALISBURY.Oh spare him, spare—Lord SALISBURY.Out servile ministers!Ye know not who it is ye wou'd attempt—Oppressive lord! whom nor the sacred bondOf justice, nor of hospitalityControls, regard me: while with sightMore dire than e'er of Gorgon feign'd, I strike thee—Now, Raymond, if thou hast of noble fireOne spark within thee, draw thy sword; come on,And meet my arm; wake all that's man within thee.Come on—'Tis Salisbury, Salisbury, calls thee to the strife.[Flings off his disguise.]Lady SALISBURY.Heaven shield my dearest lord!RAYMOND.—Salisbury!—then what am I?—Lord SALISBURY.Vengeance at length is arm'd; thy fate cries out,And honour, injur'd honour claims aloudHer victim.RAYMOND.—Secure thou seem'st of fate, but fall who willA victim, let the sword—[Drawing.]GREY.What would you do?—[Aside Holding his arm.]Look not to know him, all may yet be well—Be not abus'd, my lord: this is a plot,Devis'd with purpose to effect thy ruin.Lord SALISBURY.Ha! what dost say?GREY.Believe him not, my lord. He! he lord Salisbury!'Tis all a trick, an artful cheat, and heA lyar trac'd—Lord SALISBURY.Nay then my sword——Dishonest knights![Going to attack Raymond, he is disarmed.]Lady SALISBURY.Now by these tears do him no violence;He is, he is my husband.GREY.Regard her not:He hath conspir'd against thee, and demandsThe hand of justice.Lord SALISBURY.Will ye not ope ye heavens, and instant sendYour thunder to my aid?—Unhand me villains,Or, by the powers of vengeance, I will dashYou piecemeal.RAYMOND.Bear the traitor hence, and bindHis stubborn arms: bestow the lady safeWithin her chamber.Lady SALISBURY.I will not part my husband—Hold your hands—They overpower me—Barbarous, barbarous men!Lord SALISBURY.Ruffians forbear your more than impious hands.Lady SALISBURY.Yet hear me, Raymond—by these streaming eyesOh! hear me yet—RAYMOND.Away—Lord SALISBURY.Slaves! murderers![They are forced off severally.]RAYMOND.Away with him, away—honour is lost,And shame must henceforth be my only portion.[Exeunt omnes.]END OF THE THIRD ACT.ACT IV.Enter RAYMOND and GREY.GREY.MY lord, you waste the precious hours in coldIrresolute delays: nor circumstanceNor time admit of long deliberation.RAYMOND.—Wou'd I had never seen this fatal mansion!GREY.A sorry wish, my lord. Behold the fierce,The lordly ranger of the desert wild;No sluggish fears he knows; he pauses not,Nor looks behind, but onward speeds him tillHe gripes the trembling prey: be ever thusThe youth, whom thirst of love and beauty fires.RAYMOND.—Away; call forth my train—nay murmur not:Command that ere the lark proclaim the mornThey hold them each prepar'd. Here I will rest,If rest I can, this night; to-morrow's sunShall see me fled for ever from these walls.GREY.—Go—I detain thee not.Summon thy train, mount the swift steed, away;The gates shall open to thy flight—but know,That shame and scorn shall follow at thy heels.Yet worse; the insulted baron next pursues thee:Nor rocks, nor mountains, nor opposing seasShall stay him, but with more than mortal rageHe shall assail thee.RAYMOND.—Are there no other means?GREY.None.RAYMOND.No other way but murder? Horrid thought!—Oh Grey if e'er the dagger's drawn I feelSuch perturbation here, what then, oh whatShall prove my portion when 'tis steep'd in blood?The drops can from the point be wip'd away,But never from the mind.GREY.Lift, lift thine eye,And let it gaze upon the bright reward.Riches and honours grace the swelling act,While beauty, like the ruby-crowned morn,When first she peers upon the mountain top,Comes smiling on to meet you—These are objects,My lord, would irritate the palsied armItself of fear; excite the lagging blood,And spur it on to acts of noble daring.RAYMOND.What wou'd you do?—Think—Salisbury is a nameOf all belov'd, of more than vulgar swayThrough out the land; a deed unauthoriz'dAs this shall never 'scape the arm of justice.GREY.Such wary counsels shall our steps o'er-ruleAs may deride suspicion—One there is,A knight among thy vassal train perhapsUnnoted: soft of speech he is, and fair;But of a heart that mocks at human feelings:Him I have sounded with reserve; and findHim not unapt to this our secret purpose—
But say, what recompense, what high rewardA waits the man, whose arm for thee enactsSuch signal service?RAYMOND.Half my fortunes, allWou'd I on him bestow, whose prosperous artsShou'd make the fair one mine.GREY.She shall be thine.RAYMOND.But say, my friend, what tale, what rare deviceShou'd fruitful art explore that might amuseHer just suspicions?GREY.Innocence, the maskOf innocence, and counterfeited sorrow—Enter ELEANOR.ELEANOR.If beauty in distress, if dignityNow sinking into ruin can assailThy pity, come, oh! come, and weep to see—.GREY.The countess, I suppose.ELEANOR.My lord, my lord,'Twou'd melt the savage into human softness,And make him howl forth pity to behold her—Did you behold her, pale, disorder'd asShe runs, now calling wildly on her lord,Again upon her son, again on thee.Sometimes, alas! she beats her beauteous bosom;
Anon in frantic mood tears from her headThe silken hairs, which fall in heaps unheeded;Wrings her white hands, and weeps and raves by turns,Till nature spent and wearied gives her pause.RAYMOND.Away—we will speak comfort to her sorrows.[Exit Eleanor.]—Wretch that I am!—But I will yield them up;Son, husband, all I will resign, if soI may appease her phrenzy.[Going, is detained by Grey.]GREY.Be not rash.Short is the date of every stronger passion;Unstay'd the mind of woman; by a breathOft agitated, by a breath compos'd—Yield them, my lord! it wou'd be madness, ruin.RAYMOND.Which ever way I turn, it is destruction.GREY.O'ercast with fear, thine eye takes nothing inBut fancies of the sickliest hue—For shame,Rouse, rouse my noble lord; awake, shake offThis weakness. Pleasure must be woo'd with toil.Go to her, solace her; if that shou'd fail,Permit her as by stealth to visit Salisbury;At sight of him this tumult shall subside.RAYMOND.With love and pity I am torn. In vainI strive; too far I am advanc'd in error.Oh! will no hand disclose a path wherebyI may return?—Accurs'd be thou, myself;And doubly be accurs'd that fatal hourI turn'd mine ear to thy destructive counsels.[Goes out in great agitation.GREYalone.—My hopes begin to totter.If he resign them, Salisbury is appeas'd,And he retires: what then becomes of Grey?On me, on me of course the tempest falls.That must not be—He goes to see her now—Who knows what new-sprung hope may follow thence?There is a charm in soft distress, that worksUpon the soul like magic; causing loveOft times, as oft exciting loose desire—It is most apt. I will, before he goesTo her, explore each access to his heart;Attack each avenue that leads to virtue;Try every mining art that may assistThe loose contagion: Shou'd he seize her beauties,Farewel remorse; then dies the injur'd husband.[Exit.Scene opening, discovers lord SALISBURY on the ground, in chains.Enter LEROCHES.LEROCHES.Alas! on the cold ground. I fear his wrongsHave made him mad; I heard him rage—My lord—Rise, rise, my lord, and speak to thy Leroches.Lord SALISBURY.—Thou art unkind.LEROCHES.Oh! wou'd to Heaven that I cou'd ease thy troubles!Lord SALISBURY.I had in sweet oblivion lost myselfAnd every care; why hast thou call'd me backTo hated recollection?—O my wrongs!
My wrongs! they now come rushing o'er my head—Again, again, they wake me into madness.LEROCHES.Thy wrongs shall be reveng'd.Lord SALISBURY.Torn from them both!—Let me not think.LEROCHES.Think on our friends, my lord:Perhaps even now they are at hand; and soonWill thunder at the gates.Lord SALISBURY.Is't possible?Or do my eyes but false persuade me to it?—In trammels! and within my walls! beneathThat roof where I am sole-invested lord!—LEROCHES.Look, behold.Lord SALISBURY.I see; thou art dishonour'd.LEROCHES.'Tis the willOf Heaven, and I submit me to my fortunes.Lord SALISBURY.How cam'st thou hither?LEROCHES.By command, as ISuppose, of—but I will not name him.Lord SALISBURY.BlastsUpon him!—Didst thou see my wife?LEROCHES.No, my lord.Lord SALISBURY.Nor my son?LEROCHES.My lord I saw not either.Lord SALISBURY.Nor of either heard?LEROCHES.No, my good lord, I trust that they are safe.Lord SALISBURY.Hear me, sweet Heaven! ye throned powers above,Dread arbiters of mortal doings, hear—Dry not instant up the springs of life,But grant me measure of revenge. Unbind,For pity these dishonour'd limbs unbind,And give this monster to my willing arm:If I not firmly gripe, if I not tearWith more than savage force his hated form—Enter a KNIGHT.Traitor!What hast thou done? Bring forth my honour'd dame—Haste, bring her instant; give her to my arms,Uninjur'd, undefil'd, or by the soulsOf the most holy and unspotted saints—Spare me, good Heaven—I am, I am to blame—Imports thy coming aught with me?KNIGHT.BeholdIn me thy better angel, come to warnThee of unguarded danger—Oh my lord!My lord! beware of horrid treachery—Whatever knight thou not'st, that traitor likeApproacheth thee with smiles; that with the charmOf honey'd speech would practice on thy hearing,Of him beware—They seek thy ruin; chanceBetray'd their purpose; I was touch'd with pity.[Going.]Lord SALISBURY.Nay, go not yet.KNIGHT.Suspicion's on the watch;My thoughts are scarce my own.Lord SALISBURY.It is for guilt,Not conscious honesty to taste of fear.KNIGHT.Know then, my lord, tho' strict necessityEnrolls me in the list of Raymond's train,Yet doth my soul abhor the unhallow'd service.Lord SALISBURY.Be thou but faithful, and discover allThou know'st, so shalt thou thrive in Salisbury's favour.KNIGHT.Fear not my faith. But shall lord Salisbury proveA friend indeed? for I shall need thy armAnd interest both against so great a foe.Lord SALISBURY.Now by my honour, ever yet held dear,I will protect thee 'gainst whatever foe.KNIGHT.Morton desires but this—Know then, that lateAs by the western porch I stood, my earWas met by certain voices: strait I turn'd;And thro' the crevice of th' adjoining doorWas known that same insidious knight and Grey,In low, but earnest converse. Thee they nam'd:And I cou'd hear the latter, whilst he said,"A dagger is the best. With honest smiles,"And fair-instructed speech you must essay him."Thy peace and fortunes on this feat depend."Lord SALISBURY.I thank thee for this warning; and ere longShall recompense thy love.MORTON.Had I the powerTo serve thee, as the will, thou should'st not wearThose marks of shame—But oh! the unhappy countess!Lord SALISBURY.What, what of her?MORTON.Alas! to think the pangsShe feels this moment, torn as she hath beenBy rude barbarians from her lord and son.Lord SALISBURY.But is she safe? hath not dishonour reach'd her?MORTON.Oh may she never know dishonour!—YetLord Raymond—Lord SALISBURY.Perish the detested nameFor ever! for it makes my blood outcourseThe wholesome speed of nature.MORTON.It is true,He holds her in his power—Lord SALISBURY.He does, he does;And I do live to know it.MORTON.But I trustHe will not use that power—Farewel, my lord;I will away, and gather all I canOf their condition.Lord SALISBURY.Thou shalt win my love.See, see my wife, oh! see her if thou can'st:Speak comfort to her. Say the only pangs I feelAre for her safety. Bid her hope for timely aid;But to remember still, the virtuous mindWill welcome death itself before dishonour.MORTON.To see her, is a task I fear will foilMy utmost; but no art shall be untried.[Exit MORTON.Lord SALISBURY.Is there no way to freedom?—Oh my friends!My friends! Haste, Ardolf, haste to my revenge.LEROCHES.Thy fierce impatience, thy untoward willIt is, my lord, that hath betray'd our safeties.To Ardolf deaf, thou would'st not wait his succours;Deaf too to me, thou would'st approach the castle.Lord SALISBURY.Fear not: this stranger, like Heav'n's brighter star,Hath risen propitious—Heav'ns! but what of that?My wife!—perhaps even now within the gripeOf fell incontinence she struggles—BewareThat thought—down, down, or I shall rage to madness.LEROCHES.My lord, he wou'd not—Lord SALISBURY.Hark!—LEROCHES.He wou'd not, dare not, sure: or if he dare,Her inborn dignity, her virtue—Lord SALISBURY.Peace!—Lady SALISBURY.Hold off your brutal hands![from without.Lord SALISBURY.'Tis she! 'tis she!The slave assails her—Let me forth—Slaves! murderers! instant let me forth, or I—Lady SALISBURY.Hast thou no touch of pity?Lord SALISBURY.Horror! horror!Out hair! out by the roots! nor let a grainBe left to tell there grew such honours there.Lady SALISBURY.O my lord! my lord!—Lord SALISBURY.By Heav'n I will not be restrain'd—[LERO. strives to stay him.Nor all your bolts, nor barriers, all the pow'rsOf hell united shall withhold me from her—[Exit.LEROCHES.Preserve him, Heaven!

Such an outrage—No,I will not weep. They think I have no means:'Tis false: I will resume a spirit.ELEANOR.Alas! alas!Lady SALISBURY.I had a son; sweet William! thou hast heardHim prattle: there was music on his tongue.ELEANOR.Can Heav'n behold such crimes, and not awakeIt's thunders?Lady SALISBURY.Weep'st thou? I can weep myself;I have some cause—He is my husband, who
Will part us?—Cold, cold, cold. The rains beat sore,And the winds make a noise; 'tis a rough night;No little star to guide his darkling steps—The Heav'ns do rain down pity for me.ELEANOR.RaveNot thus, dear lady; oh! be comforted.Lady SALISBURY.Yes, yes; I know: these trifles have disturb'd me.The bird is rifl'd.Poor flutterer! oh! it was nought to spoilHer of her little hope—Did'st thou not seeHer valiant mate, how fierce he shook his plumes,And peck'd at them? Did he not?—He had sav'dHis mistress from the spoilers, but they snar'd him.Lord SALISBURYentering.Where is the slave? I will not brook delay.Lady SALISBURY.He's come! he's come—Now, ruffians, I have foundHim, we will die together e'er you part us.Lord SALISBURY.Hell! what are your blackest horrors to this?Lady SALISBURY.We will have justice—Bury Grey alive.Lord SALISBURY.She's lost!Lady SALISBURY.Say you!—Put Raymond to the torture.Lord SALISBURY.I will tear him joint by joint.Lady SALISBURY.But they will part us—They come—You shall not—no; no pow'r on earthShall force me—Now they pull—Hold, hold, my lord—Yet closer—now, now, now.Lord SALISBURY.My wife, my Ela!Lost as thou art, oh! do not leave me.MORTON.Distressful sight!—Oh most inhuman Grey!ELEANOR.Nature, my lord, unequal to the conflict,Has for a space retir'd within herself;But shortly to return.
