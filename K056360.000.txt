THE Earl of Warwick, A TRAGEDY, As it is perform'd at the THEATRE ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE.LONDON: Printed for T. DAVIES, Russel-Street, Covent-Garden; R. BALDWIN, Pater-Noster-Row; and W. GRIFFIN, Catharine-Street, in the Strand. M.DCC.LXVI. [Price ONE SHILLING and SIXPENCE.]Advertisement. To the PUBLIC,THE author takes this opportunity to acknowledge his obligation to the public, for their favourable reception of THE EARL OF WARWICK. He flatters himself, that the license so necessary to his plan, which he has taken in common with other writers, in deviating from historical truth, especially in a period so distant and obscure, will meet with indulgence.For the many faults  of this piece, he can only plead that title to  is generally extended in favour of a first essay, and  that the same candour which approv'd on the stage, will accompany it to the closet.He cannot, without the most manifest injustice, forbear to add, that the more than ordinary exertion of dramatic powers, display'd by the principal actors concerned in it, contributed in a great measure to the success of the performance.ERRATA.For the blush of virgin modesty read the crimson glow of modesty.PROLOGUE,Written by GEORGE COLMAN, Esq Spoken by Mr. BENSLEY.SEVERE each poet's lot; but sure most hardIs the condition of the playhouse bard:Doom'd to hear all that wou'd-be critics talk,And in the go-cart of dull rules to walk!"Yet authors multiply," you say. 'Tis true.But what a numerous crop of critics too!Scholars alone of old durst judge and write;But now each journalist turns Stagyrite.Quintilians in each coffee-house you meet,And many a Longinus walks the street.In Shakespear's days, when his advent'rous muse,A muse of fire! durst each bold licence use,Her noble ardour met no critic's phlegm,To check wild fancy, or her flights condemn:Ariels and Calibans unblam'd she drew,Or goblins, ghosts, and witches, brought to view.If to historic truth she shap'd her verse,A nation's annals freely she'd rehearse;Bring Rome's or England's story on the stage,And run, in three short hours, thro' half an age.Our bard, all terror-struck, and fill'd with dread,In Shakespear's awful footsteps dares not tread;Thro' the wide field of hist'ry fears to stray,And builds upon one narrow spot his play;Steps not from realm to realm, whole feas between,But barely changes twice or thrice his scene:While Shakespear vaults on the poetic wire,And pleas'd spectators fearfully admire,Our bard, a critic pole between his hands,On the tight-rope, scarce balanc'd, trembling stands;Slowly and cautiously his way he makes,And fears to fall at ev'ry step he takes:While then fierce Warwick he before you brings,That setter-up and puller-down of kings,With British candour dissipate his sear!An English story fits an English ear.Tho' harsh and crude you deem his first essay,A second may your favours well repay;Applause may nerve his verse, and chear his heart,And teach the practice of this dangerous art.Dramatis Personae.KING EDWARD,Mr. POWELL.EARL of WARWICK,Mr. HOLLAND.EARL of PEMBROKE,Mr. BENSLEY.EARL of SUFFOLK,Mr. PACKER.MARGARET of ANJOU,Mrs. YATES.LADY ELIZ.

THE EARL of WARWICK.ACT I.SCENE I.MARGARET of ANJOU, Lady CLIFFORD.CLIFFORD.THANKS! gracious heav'n, my royal mistress smiles,Unusual gladness sparkles in her eye,And bids me welcome in the stranger joyTo his new mansion.MARGARET.Yes, My faithful Clifford,Fortune is weary of oppressing me:Through my dark cloud of grief, a chearful rayOf light breaks forth, and gilds the whole horison.CLIFFORD.Henry in chains, and Edward on the throneOf Lancaster, thyself a pris'ner here,Thy captive son torn from his mother's arms,And in the tyrant's pow'r, a kingdom lost:
Amidst so many sorrows, what new hopeHath wrought this wond'rous change?MARGARET.That which aloneIn sorrow's bitt'rest hour, can ministerSweet comfort to the daughters of affliction,And bid misfortune smile, the hope of vengeance:Vengeance, benignant patron of distress,Thee I have oft invoked, propitious nowThou smil'st upon me, if I do not graspThe glorious opportunity, henceforthIndignant frown, and leave me to my fate!CLIFFORD.Unhappy Princess! that deceiver hopeHath often flatter'd, and as oft betray'd thee:What hast thou gain'd by all its promises?What's the reward of all thy toils?MARGARET.Experience—Yes, Clifford, I have read th' instructive volumeOf human nature, there long since have learn'dThe way to conquer men is by their passions;Catch but the ruling foible of their hearts,And all their boasted virtues shrink before you.Edward and Warwick, those detested names,Too well thou know'st, united to destroy me.CLIFFORD.That was indeed a fatal league.MARGARET.But mark me;If we cou'd break this adamantine chain,We might again be free: this mighty warrior,
This dread of kings, th' unconquerable Warwick,Is plighted to the fair Elizabeth.CLIFFORD.The lady Gray, you mean, the beauteous widow,Whose husband fell in arms for Lancaster.MARGARET.The same, my Clifford—Warwick long has lov'd—CLIFFORD.And means to wed her.MARGARET.But if I have art,Or she ambition, that shall never be.CLIFFORD.Can'st thou prevent it?MARGARET.Yes, my Clifford, WarwickWere a mean choice for such transcendent beauty;I shall provide her with a fitter husband,A nobler far, and worthier of her charms,Young Edward.—CLIFFORD.Ha! the king! impossible!Warwick, ev'n now, commission'd by the state,To treat with Lewis, offers England's throneTo France's daughter, and e'er this, perhaps,Hath sign'd the solemn contract.MARGARET.Solemn trifles!Mere cobweb ties—Love's a despotic tyrant,And laughs, like other kings, at public faith,When it opposes private happiness:Edward is youthful, gay, and amorous;His soul is ever open to the lure
Of beauty, and Elizabeth hath charmsMight shake a hermit's virtue.CLIFFORD.Hath he seenThis peerless fair one?MARGARET.Yes,—by my contrivance,When last he hunted in the forest, some,Whom I had planted there, as if by chanceAlone directed, led him cross the lawnTo Grafton, there—ev'n as my soul had wish'd,The dazzling lustre of her charms surpris'dHis unsuspecting heart—CLIFFORD.What follow'd?MARGARET.O!He gaz'd and wonder'd; for a while his prideIndignant rose, and struggled with his passion,But love was soon victorious: and last night,The earl of Suffolk, so my trusty spiesInform me, was dispatch'd on wings of love,To plead his master's cause, and offer herThe throne of England.CLIFFORD.What if she refuseThe golden bribe?MARGARET.No matter; all I wishIs but to make them foes: the gen'rous WarwickIs fiery, and impatient of reproof,He will not brook a rival in his loveThough seated on a throne; besides, thou know'st,
The haughty earl looks down with scorn on Edward,As the mere work of his all-pow'rful hand,The baby monarch of his own creation.CLIFFORD.Believe me, madam, Edward still reveresAnd loves him, still as conscious of the debt,Pays him with trust and confidence; their soulsAre link'd together in the strictest bondsOf sacred friendship.MARGARET.That but serves my cause:Where ties are close, and interests united,The slightest inj'ries are severely felt;Offended friendship never can forgive.CLIFFORD.Now the full prospect opens to my view,I see thy distant aim, and trace the pathsOf vengeance: England soon will be a sceneOf blood and horror, discord's fatal torchOnce lit up it in this devoted land,What pow'r shall e'er extinguish it? alas!I tremble at the consequence.MARGARET.And IEnjoy it:—O! 'twill be a noble contestOf pride 'gainst pride, oppression 'gainst oppression;Rise but the storm, and let the waves beat high,The wreck may be our own: in the warm struggle,Who knows but one or both of them may fall,And Marg'ret rise triumphant on their ruin!It must be so; and see the king approaches:This way he passes from the council—markHis down-cast eye, he is a stricken deer,
The arrow's in his side—he cannot 'scape:We'll meet and speak to him.CLIFFORD.What mean you, madam?MARGARET.To ask him—what, I know, he will refuse;That gives me fair pretext to break with him,And join the man I hate, vindictive Warwick;But soft, he comes—SCENE II.KING EDWARD, MARGARET, CLIFFORD, OFFICER.EDWARD.Is Suffolk yet return'd? (to an Officer.)OFFICER.No, my good liege.EDWARD.Go, wait and bring him to me,[Ex. Of.I'll to my closet.Pardon me, fair lady,I saw you not.MARGARET.Perhaps it is beneathA conqu'ror to look down upon his slave;But I've a boon to ask.EDWARD.Whate'er it is,Within the limits of fair courtesy,Which honour can bestow, I'll not refuse thee.MARGARET.There was a time when Margaret of AnjouWou'd not have deign'd to ask of Edward ought;Nor was there ought which Edward dar'd refuse her;
But that is past, great Warwick's arm prevail'd,And I am now your pris'ner.EDWARD.Since the hour,When fortune smil'd propitious on the causeOf justice, and gave vict'ry to our arms;You have been treated with all due respect,All your condition, or your sex cou'd claim;Serv'd like a queen, and lodg'd within our palace:Is there ought more you can with reason ask,Or I in prudence grant you.MARGARET.Give me backThe liberty I lost, restore my son,And I may then, perhaps, be reconcil'dTo un usurper, may with-hold my vengeance,And let thee fit unpunish'd on—my throne.EDWARD.You talk too proudly, madam; but to shew youI cannot fear, you have your liberty.Letters this morning I receiv'd from France,Have offer'd noble ransom for your person;Without that ransom—for the soul of EdwardIs far above the sordid lust of gold,I grant it—from this moment you are free;But for your son—I cannot part with him.MARGARET.I scorn your bounties, scorn your proffer'd freedom,What's liberty to me without my child?But fate will place us soon above thy reach,Thy short-liv'd tyranny is almost past,The storm is gath'ring round thee, and will burstWith ten-fold vengeance on thy guilty head.EDWARD.I am not to be talk'd into submission,Nor dread the menace of a clam'rous woman.MARGARET.Thou may'st have cause to dread a woman's pow'r:The time may come—mark my prophetic word—When wayward beauty shall repay with scornThy fruitless vows, and vindicate my wrongs:The friend thou lean'st on, like a broken reed,Shall pierce thy side, and fill thy soul with anguish,Keen as the pangs I feel: York's perjur'd houseShall sink to rise no more, and LancasterWith added lustre re-assume the throne.Hear this and tremble—give me back my son—Or dread the vengeance of a desp'rate mother.SCENE III.EDWARD.Imperious woman! but the voice of woeIs ever clam'rous: 'tis the privilege,The charter of affliction to complain.—This tardy Suffolk! how I long to knowYet dread to hear my fate! Elizabeth,On thee the colour of my future lifeDepends, for thou alone can'st make me blest,Or curs'd for ever:—O! this cruel doubtIs worse than all my tortures: but he comes,Th' ambassador of love.SCENE IV.EDWARD, EARL of SUFFOLK.EDWARD.What news, my Suffolk?Shall I be happy? O! I'm on the rack
Of expectation, didst thou tell my taleAs if it were thy own, and may I hope—SUFFOLK.My royal liege.EDWARD.Good Suffolk, lay asideThe forms of dull respect, be brief, and tell me,Speak, hast thou seen her, will she be my queen?Quick, tell me ev'ry circumstance, each word,Each look, each gesture; didst thou mark them, Suffolk?SUFFOLK.I did, and will recount it all;—last nightBy your command, in secret I repair'dTo Grafton's tufted bow'r, the happy seatOf innocence and beauty, there I foundThy soul's best hope, the fair Elizabeth,Ne'er did these eyes behold such sweet perfection:I found her busy'd in the pious officeOf filial duty, tending her sick father.EDWARD.That was a lucky moment, to preferMy humble suit: touch but the tender stringOf soft compassion in the heart, and loveWill quickly vibrate to its kindred passion;You urg'd our royal purpose, then?SUFFOLK.I did,With all the warmth of friendship, dwelt with pleasureOn ev'ry princely virtue that adornsYour noble heart; she listen'd with attention,And echo'd back your praises.EDWARD.Was not that
A kind propitious omen?SUFFOLK.Such indeedHoping to find it, I call'd in the pow'rsOf flattery to my aid, and gaz'd upon her,As if confounded by her dazling beauties—Conscious she smil'd; but when, at length, I spakeOf England's monarch sighing at her feet—The blush of virgin modesty o'erspreadHer cheek, and gave new lustre to her charms;She turned aside, and as she silent bow'dHer doubtful thanks, I mark'd the pearly tearSteal down its secret track, and from her breastHeard a deep sigh, she struggled to conceal;If I have any judgment, or can traceThe hidden feelings of a woman's heart,Her's is already fix'd: I fear, my liege,With all that England, all that thou coud'st give,The crown wou'd fit but heavy on her brow.EDWARD.Not heavier, Suffolk, than it sits on mine:My throne is irksome to me; who wou'd wishTo be a sov'reign, when ElizabethPresers a subject?—Then th' impetuous Warwick,His awful virtue will chastise my weakness.I dread his censure, dread his keen reproaches,And dread them more because they will be just.I've promis'd Lewis to espouse his daughter,To strengthen our alliance: wou'd to heav'nI had not! If I seek this coy refuser,And break with France, Warwick will take th' alarm;If once offended, he's inexorable.SUFFOLK.I know him well—Believe me, Sir, the highAnd haughty spirit, when it meets rebuke,Is easiest check'd, and sinks into submission.Let him, my liege, who ventures to arraignHis master's conduct, look into his own:There ever is a corner in the heartOpen to folly; Warwick is not freeFrom human frailties.EDWARD.No: ambition firesHis noble breast, love triumphs over mine:But well thou know'st, our eyes are ever openTo other's faults, and shut against our own.We seldom pity woes we ne'er experienc'd,Or pardon weakness which we do not feel:He is a hero.SUFFOLK.Hero's are but men;I have some cause to think so—but of thatWe'll talk another time: mean while my liege,I think lord Warwick is a useful friend.EDWARD.Aye, and a dangerous foe; the people love,To adoration love him; if he fallsFrom his allegiance, crouds will follow him.England has long been rent by civil broils,And fain wou'd rest her in the arms of peace:Her wounds scarce clos'd, shall Edward open them,And bid them bleed a-fresh? believe me, Suffolk,I wou'd not be the cause of new divisionsAmongst my people, for a thousand kingdoms.SUFFOLK.'Tis nobly said, and may thy grateful subjects,Revere thy virtues, and reward thy love!EDWARD.O! Suffolk, did they know but half the caresThat wait on royalty, they wou'd not grudgeTheir wretched master a few private hoursOf social happiness.—If France consents,I am undone: and Warwick hath e'er thisEnslav'd me: curse on this state policy,That binds us thus to love at second hand!Who knows but he may link me to a wretch;Wed me to folly, ignorance, and pride,Ill-nature, sickness, or deformity;And when I'm chain'd to mis'ry, coldly tell me,To sooth my griefs, 'twas for the public good.SUFFOLK.How far you have commission'd him, I know not,But were I worthy to advise, my liege,I wou'd not be the dupe of his ambition,But follow natures dictates, and be happy.England has charms besides Elizabeth's,And beauties that—EDWARD.No more; my heart is fix'dOn her alone; find out this pow'rful rival,I charge thee, Suffolk: yet why wish to find,What found will make me wretched? were he boundIn cords of tend'rest friendship round my heart,Dearer than Warwick, dearer than thyself,Forgive me, but I fear I shou'd abhor him.O think on something that may yet be done,To win her to my heart e'er Warwick comes.SUFFOLK.I hear he is expected every hour.EDWARD.Grant heav'n some friendly storm may yet retard him!I dread his presence here.SCENE IV.MESSENGER, EDWARD, SUFFOLK.MESSENGER.My liege, the earlOf Warwick, is arriv'd.EDWARD.Ha! when? how? where?Wou'd he were bury'd in the rapid wavesThat brought him hither! comes he here to night?MESSENGER.My liege, e'er now he might have reaoh'd the palace,But that the shouting multitudes press hardOn ev'ry side, and seem to worship him.SCENE V.SUFFOLK, EDWARD.SUFFOLK.Such adorationBut ill befits the idol, that receives it.EDWARD.What's to be done? I cannot, must not see him,Till all is fix'd: once more, my best-lov'd Suffolk;Try the soft arts of thy persuasive tongue:What method can'st thou think on, to evadeThis promis'd marriage with ambitious France?SUFFOLK.Summon your council, lay your thoughts before them,Meet Warwick there, and urge a sov'reigns right,To please himself in that which shou'd concernHimself alone—firm Buckingham and IWill plead your cause against the haughty Warwick,Whom I wou'd treat with cold civility,And distant state which ever angers moreResentful spirits, than the warmth of passion.EDWARD.'Tis well advis'd:—mean-time if possible,I will compose my troubled thoughts to rest:Suffolk, adieu: if Warwick asks for me,I am not well, I'm hunting in the forest—I'm busy—stay—remember what I told you,Touching the earldom which I mean to giveHer father; that may bring her to the court;You understand me, Suffolk—fare thee well.SCENE VI.EDWARD.Why shou'd I dread to see the man I love—The man I rev'rence—Warwick is not chang'd,But Edward is—Suffolk, I know, abhors him—A fav'rite must be hated—if he urgesThis dreadful contract, I shall hate him too:I cannot live without Elizabeth:I'll think no more—if I must sacrificeMy friendship or my love—the choice is made.END of the FIRST ACT.ACT II.SCENE I.WARWICK (Speaking to an officer.)WARWICK.'TIS well: I shall attend his highness' pleasure.[Comes forward.]Meet me i'th' council! Warwick might have claim'dA private audience—After all my toils,My perils in his service, 'tis a coldUnkind reception: some base whisperer,Some needy sycophant, perhaps, hath poison'dMy royal master's ear—or, do I judgeToo rashly? As my embassy concernsThe public welfare, he wou'd honour meWith public thanks.—Elizabeth will chide meFor this unkind delay—but honour calls,And duty to my king: that task perform'd,I haste, my love, to happiness and thee.SCENE II. the COUNCIL CHAMBER.King EDWARD, Dukes of CLARENCE, and BUCKINGHAM, Earls of SUFFOLK, PEMBROKE, &c.EDWARD.Good Buckingham, I thank thee for thy counsel,Nor blame thy honest warmth; I love this freedom, is the birth-right of an Englishman,And doth become thee: what says noble Suffolk?SUFFOLK.I wou'd not cross my royal master's will;But, on my soul, I think, this nuptial leagueWith France prepost'rous and impolitic!It cannot last; we are by nature foes,And nought but mutual poverty and weakness,Can ever make us friends—she wants our aidAgainst the pow'rful Burgundy, and therefore,Throws out this lure of beauty to ensnare you,That purpose gain'd, she turns her arms against us.PEMBROKE.Why, let her: if she comes with hostile arm,England thank heav'n, is ready to receive her:I love my country, and revere my king,As much perhaps as honest Buckingham,Or my good fearful lord of Suffolk here,Who knows so well, or wou'd be thought to know,What France will do hereafter: yet I think,The faith of nations is a thing so sacred,It ought not to be trifled with.—I hateAs much as you th' unnatural forc'd alliance,And yet, my lords, if Warwick is empow'r'd,For so I hear he is, to treat with Lewis;I know not how in honour you can swerveFrom his conditions.(shouting.)Hark! the hero comes:Those shouts proclaim him near: the joyful peopleWill usher in their great delivererAs he deserves.SCENE III.KING EDWARD, CLARENCE, SUFFOLK, BUCKINGHAM, PEMBROKE, WARWICK.EDWARD.Thrice welcome, noble Warwick,Welcome to all![to Clarence, Pembroke, &c.SUFFOLK.You've had, my lord, I fear,An arduous task, which few cou'd execute.But Warwick, in the council and the field,A like distinguish'd, and a like successful.EDWARD.What says our cousin France?WARWICK.By me, my liege,He greets you well, and hopes in closer tiesUnited soon to wear a dearer name.At length, thank heav'n! the iron gates of warAre clos'd, and peace displays her silken bannersO'er the contending nations, ev'ry doubtIs now remov'd, and confidence establish'd,I hope, to last for ages.EDWARD.Peace, my lord,Is ever welcome; 'tis the gift of heav'n,The nurse of science, art's fair patroness,And merit's best protector; but if FranceWou'd chain us down to ignominious terms,Cramp our free commerce, and infringe the rightsOf our liege subjects, England may repent
Too late her rash credulity, and peaceWith all her blessings may be bought too dear.WARWICK.The shame wou'd then be his, who made the purchase.If any doubt my faith, my honest zealFor thee and for my country, let him speak,And I will answer: punish me, just heav'n,If in the task I have consulted oughtBut England's honour, and my sov'reign's glory!EDWARD.Mistake me not, good Warwick, well I knowThy spotless truth, thy honour, and thy love;But glory has no further charms for me:Rais'd by thy pow'rful aid to England's throne,I ask no more:—already I am greatAs fame and fortune with their smiles can make me,And all I wish for now is—to be happy.WARWICK.That too my liege, hath been thy Warwick's care;Happy thou shalt be if the fairest formThat ever caught a gazing lover's eye,Join'd to the sweetest most engaging virtuesCan make thee so:—Bona accepts with joyThy proffer'd hand: she is indeed a gemFit to adorn the brightest crown: to seeIs to admire her; trust me, England's selfThe seat of beauty, and the throne of love,Boasts not a fairer.EDWARD.Beauty, good my lord,Is all ideal, 'tis the wayward childOf fancy, shifting with the changeful windOf fond opinion; what to you appears
The model of perfection, may disgustMy strange capricious taste.WARWICK.Such charms would fixInconstancy itself:—her winning virtues,Ev'n if her beauty fail'd, would soon subdueThe rebel heart, and you wou'd learn to love her.EDWARD.Is passion to be learn'd then? woud'st thou makeA science of affection, guide the heart,And teach it where to fix? impossible!'Tis strange philosophy.(Rises and comes forward.)My lord, of Warwick,Your zeal in England's, and in Edward's causeMerits our thanks; but for th' intended marriageWith France's daughter—it may never be.WARWICK.Not be! it must: your sacred word is pass'd,And cannot be recall'd: but three days sinceI sign'd the contract, and my honour's pledg'dFor the performance: heav'n's! whilst fickle FranceIs branded 'midst the nations of the earth,For breach of public faith, shall we, my liege,Practise ourselves the vices we condemn,Pass o'er a rival nation's ev'ry virtue,And imitate their persidy alone?EDWARD.You'll pardon me, my lord, I thought it partOf a king's pow'r to have a will, to seeWith his own eyes, and in life's little feast,To cater for himself; but 'tis, it seems,A privilege his servants can refuse him.WARWICK.And so they ought—the king, who cannot conquerHis private int'rest for the public welfare,Knows not his duty.EDWARD.Kings, my lord, are bornWith passions, feelings, hearts—like other men;Nor see I yet, why Edward's happinessMust fall a sacrifice to Warwick's honour.WARWICK.My honour, Sir, is your's; my cause your own:Who sent me, and whose image did I bear,The image of a great and glorious king,Or of a weak and wav'ring boy?—henceforth,Choose from the herd of fawning sycophants,Some needy slave for your mock ambassys,To do your work, and stain the name of EnglandWith foul reproach—Edward, I blush for thee,And for my country; from this hour, expectFrom injur'd France contempt, with deep resentmentFor broken faith, and enmity eternal.EDWARD.Eternal be it then; for, as I prizeMy inward peace, beyond the pomp of state,And all the tinsel glare of fond ambition,I will not wed her. Gracious heav'n! what am I?The meanest peasant in my realm may chuseHis rustic bride, and share with her the sweetsOf mutual friendship and domestic bliss;Why shou'd my happier subjects then deny meThe common rights, the privilege of nature,And in a land of freedom thus conspireTo make their king the only slave amongst 'em?WARWICK.The worst of slaves is he whom passion rules,Uncheck'd by reason and the pow'rful voiceOf friendship, which, I fear, is heard no moreBy thoughtless Edward—'tis the curse of kingsTo be surrounded by a venal herdOf flatterers, that sooth his darling vices,And rob their master of his subjects love.Nay, frown not, Sirs, supported as ye are,I fear you not—which of this noble train,These well-beloved counsellors and friends,Assembled here to witness my disgrace,Have urg'd to this base unmanly falsehood?Shame on you all! to stain the spotless mindOf uncorrupted youth, undo the workOf Warwick's friendly hand, and give him backA sov'reign so unlike the noble Edward.SUFFOLK.My lord, we thank you for the kind suggestionHowe'er ill-founded, and when next we meet,To give our voice in ought that may concernThe public weal, no doubt shall ask your leaveE'er we proceed.PEMBROKE.My lord of Suffolk, speakBut for yourself; Warwick hath too much causeTo be offended: in my poor opinion,Whate'er you courtiers think, the best supportOf England's throne are equity and truth;Nor will I hold that man my sov'reign's friend,Who shall exhort him to forsake his word,And play the hypocrite: what tye shall bindThe subject to obedience, when his king,
Bankrupt in honour gives the royal sanctionTo perfidy and falshood?BUCKINGHAM.It becomesBut ill the earl of Pembroke—EDWARD.Good my lords—Let us have no dissentions here; we metFor other purposes—some few days henceWe shall expect your counsel in affairsOf moment—for the present urge no furtherThis matter—fare ye well.[The council break up and disperse.EDWARD comes up to Warwick.Lord Warwick, keepIn narrower bounds, that proud impetuous temper;It may be fatal: there are private reasons—When time befits we shall impart them to you,Mean-while—if you have friendship, love, or duty,No more of Bona—I'm determin'd.SCENE IV.WARWICK.So:'Tis well: 'tis very well: I have deserv'd it;I've borne this callow eagle on my wing,And now he spurns me from him: 'tis a changeI little look'd for, and sits heavy on me:Alas! how doubly painful is the wound,When 'tis inflicted by the hand we love!Cruel, ungrateful Edward!—Ha! who's here?The captive queen! if she has ought to askOf me, she comes in luckless hour, for IAm pow'rless now.SCENE V.MARGARET of ANJOU, WARWICK.WARWICK.Will Margaret of AnjouThus deign to visit her acknowledg'd foe?MARGARET.Alas! my lord, inured to wretchednessAs I am, and familiar with misfortune,I harbour no resentment; have long sinceForgot that ever Warwick was my foe,And only wish to prove myself his friend.WARWICK.Talk not of friendship, 'tis an empty name,And lives but in idea; once indeedI thought I had a friend.—MARGARET.Whose name was—Edward;Read I aright, my lord, and am I notA shrew'd diviner? yes; that down-cast eyeAnd gloomy aspect say I am: you lookAs if the idol, made by your own hands,Had fallen upon and crushed you, is't not so?WARWICK.Amazement! nought escapes thy piercing eye,And penetrating judgment: 'tis too true,I am a poor dishonour'd slave,Not worth thy seeking; leave me, for the tideOf court preferment flows another way.MARGARET.The feast, perhaps, you have provided, suits notWith Edward's nicer palate; he disdains,
How sweet soe'er, to taste a foreign banquet,And relishes no dainties but his own:Am I again mistaken?WARWICK.Sure thou deal'stWith some all-knowing spirit, who impartsEach secret purpose to thee, else how knew'st thouThat Edward refus'd to wed the princess?MARGARET.O! it requires no supernatural aidTo trace his actions, nor has Marg'ret trodThe paths of life with unobserving eye;I could have told you this long since—for know,The choice is made, the nuptial rites prepar'd,Which, but for your return, as unexpectedAs undesired, had been, e'er this, complete;And as in duty bound, you then had paidYour due obedience to our—English queen.WARWICK.Determin'd, say'st thou? gracious heaven! 'tis wellI am return'd.MARGARET.Indeed, my lord, you cameA little out of season, 'twas unkindTo interrupt your master's happiness,To blast so fair a passion in its bloom,And check the rising harvest of his love.WARWICK.Marg'ret, I thank thee—yes, it must be so:His blushes, his confusion, all confirm it,And yet I am amaz'd, astonish'd.MARGARET.Wherefore?—
Is it so strange a youthful prince shou'd love?Is it so strange, a mind, unfraught with wisdom,And lifted high with proud prosperity,Shou'd follow pleasure thro' the crooked pathsOf falshood, shou'd forsake a useless friend,For the warm joys of animating beauty?WARWICK.No: but 'tis strange, that he who knows how muchHe ow'd to Warwick, he, who ev'ry hourTastes the rich stream of bounty, should forgetThe fountain whence it flow'd.MARGARET.Alas! my lord,Had you been chasten'd in affliction's schoolAs I have been, and taught by sad experienceTo know mankind, you had not fall'n a preyTo such delusion.WARWICK.Was it like a friend,Was it like Edward to conceal his love?Some base insinuating, artful woman,With borrow'd charms, perhaps.—MARGARET.Hold, hold, my lord,Be not too rash: who fights in darkness oftMay wound a bosom friend: perhaps you wrongThe best, and most accomplish'd of her sex.WARWICK.Know you the lady?MARGARET.But as fame reports,Of peerless beauty and transcendent charms,But for her virtues—I must ask of—you—WARWICK.Of me? what virtues? whose?MARGARET.Elizabeth's.WARWICK.Amazement! no: it must not, it cannot be:Elizabeth! he cou'd not, dare not do it!Confusion! I shall soon discover all.(aside.)But what have I to do with Edward's choice,Whoe'er she be, if he refuses mine?MARGARET.Dissimulation sits but ill, my lord,On minds like yours: I am a poor weak woman,And so, it seems, you think me; but supposeThat same all-knowing spirit which you rais'd,Who condescends so kindly to instruct me,Shou'd whisper—Warwick knows the pow'r of loveAs well as Edward, that ElizabethWas his first wish, the idol of his soul;What say you?—might I venture to believe it?WARWICK.Marg'ret, you might; for 'tis in vain to hideA thought from thee; it might have told you too,If it be so, there is not such a wretchOn earth as Warwick: give me but the proof—MARGARET.Lord Suffolk was last night dispatch'd to Grafton,To offer her a share in Edward's throne.WARWICK.Which she refus'd: did she not, Marg'ret? sayShe did.MARGARET.I know not that, my lord, but crowns
Are dazzling meteors in a woman's eye;Such strong temptations, few of us, I fear,Have virtue to resist.WARWICK.ElizabethHas every virtue, I'll not doubt her faith.MARGARET.Edward is young and handsome.WARWICK.Curses on him!Think'st thou he knew my fond attachment there?MARGARET.O passing well, my lord, and when 'twas urg'd,How deeply 'twou'd affect you, swore by heav'n,Imperious Warwick ne'er shou'd be the masterOf charms like hers; 'twas happiness, he said,Beyond a subject's merit to deserve,Beyond his hope to wish for or aspire to.WARWICK.But for that Warwick, Edward's self had beenA subject still—and—may be so—hereafter.Thou smil'st at my misfortunes.MARGARET.I must smileWhen I behold a subtle statesman thusDuped and deluded by a shallow boy,Sent on a fruitless errand to exposeHis country and himself—it was indeedA master stroke of policy, beyondOne shou'd have thought, the reach of years so greenAs Edward's, to dispatch the weeping lover,And seize the glorious opportunityOf tamp'ring with his mistress here at home.WARWICK.Did Nevil, Rutland, Clifford, bleed for this?MARGARET.For this doth Henry languish in a dungeon,And wretched Marg'ret live a life of woe:For this you gave the crown to pious Edward,And thus he thanks you for his kingdom.WARWICK.CrownsAre baubles, fit for children like himselfTo play with, I have scatter'd many of them:But thus to cross me in my dearest hope,The sweet reward of all my toils for himAnd for his country; if I suffer it,If I forgive him, may I live the scornOf men, a branded coward, and old ageWithout or love or rev'rence be my portion!Henceforth, good Marg'ret, know me for thy friend,We will have noble vengeance;—are there notStill left among'st the lazy sons of peace,Some busy spirits who wish well to theeAnd to thy cause?MARGARET.There are: resentment sleeps,But is not dead; beneath the hollow coverOf loyalty, the slumb'ring ashes lyeUnheeded, Warwick's animating breathWill quickly light them into flames again.WARWICK.Then, Edward, from this moment I abjure thee:O I will make thee ample recompenceFor all the wrongs that I have done the houseOf Lancaster:—go, summon all thy friends;
Be quick, good Marg'ret, haste e'er I repent,And yield my soul to perjur'd York again.The king, I think gives you free liberty,To range abroad.MARGARET.He doth, and I will use it,As I wou'd ever use the gift of foes,To his destruction.WARWICK.That arch-pandar, Suffolk,That minister of vice—but time is precious;To-morrow, Marg'ret, we will meet in private,And have some further conference; mean-timeDevise, consult, use ev'ry means againstOur common foe: remember, from this hour,Warwick's thy friend—be secret and be happy.SCENE VI.MARGARET.What easy fools these cunning statesmen are,With all their policy, when once they fallInto a woman's pow'r! This gallant leader,This blust'ring Warwick, how the hero shrunkAnd lessen'd to my sight!—Elizabeth,I thank thee for thy wonder-working charms;The time perhaps may come, when I shall standIndebted to them for—the throne of England.Proud York beware, for Lancaster's great nameShall rise superior in the lists of fame:Fortune that long had frown'd, shall smile at last,And make amends for all my sorrows past.END of the SECOND ACT.ACT III.SCENE I.MARGARET, CLIFFORD, Attendants.MARGARET.[to a gentleman.DISPATCH these letters strait; to Scotland—thisTo the French envoy—these to th' earl of Pembroke.[turning to lady Clifford.Thus far, my friend, hath fortune favour'd usBeyond our hopes: the soul of haughty WarwickIs all on fire, and puling Edward lovesWith most romantic ardour—O my Clifford,You wou'd have smil'd to see how artfullyI play'd upon him: flatter'd, sooth'd, provok'd,And wrought him to my purpose: we are link'dIn firmest bonds of amity and love.CLIFFORD.Hath Warwick then so soon forgot his Edward?Think'st thou the frantic earl will e'er exertHis ill-directed powers to pull downThe royal structure, which himself had rais'd?Never.MARGARET.What is there disappointed loveAnd unrestrain'd ambition will not do?I tell thee, we are sworn and cordial friends.CLIFFORD.Thou know'st he hates the house of Lancaster.MARGARET.No matter—he has marvellous good skillIn making kings, and I—have business for him.CLIFFORD.And can'st thou then forget the cruel wrongs,The deep-felt inj'ries of oppressive Warwick,To join the hand that forg'd thy husband's chainsAnd rob'd thee of a crown?MARGARET.But what—my Clifford,If the same hand that ravish'd shou'd restore it!'Tis a court friendship and may last as longAs int'rest shall direct: I've not forgot,No, nor forgiv'n; I hate, abhor, detest him,But I will use him as my instrument;My necessary tool, I'll make him drawHis trait'rous sword, to sheath it in the breastOf him he loves, then point it to his own:Yes, Clifford, I have twin'd me round his heart;Like the fell serpent crept into his bosom,That I might sting more surely: he shall perish;I keep him for the last dear precious morsel,To crown the glorious banquet of revenge.CLIFFORD.'Tis what he merits from us, yet th' attemptWere dang'rous, he is still the people's idol,MARGARET.And so perhaps shall Marg'ret be; applauseWaits on success; the fickle multitude,Like the light straw that floats along the stream,Glide with the current still and follow fortune.Our prospect brightens every hour:—the peopleAre ripe for a revolt: by civil wars,Long time inur'd to savage scenes of plunderAnd desolation, they delight in war:These English heroes, when once flesh'd with slaughter,
Like the keen mastiff, lose not soon the trackOf vengeance, nor forget the taste of blood.CLIFFORD.What further succours have we to depend on,Beside earl Warwick's?MARGARET.O his name aloneWill be an army to us.CLIFFORD.If we have it:Resentment is a short-liv'd passion—whatIf Warwick should relent, and turn againTo Edward?MARGARET.Then I have a bosom friendThat shall be ready to reward him for it;—But I have better hopes: without his aid;We are not friendless: Scotland's hardy sonsWho smile at danger, and defy the storm,Will leave their barren mountains to defendThat liberty they love: add too the aidOf gallant Pembroke, and the pow'rs which FranceWill send to vindicate her injur'd honour:E'er Edward can collect his force and takeThe field, we shall be thirty thousand strong.CLIFFORD.But what becomes of the young prince?MARGARET.Aye; thereI am indeed unhappy, O my child,How shall I set him free?—hear nature, hearA mother's pray'r! O guide me with thy counsel,And teach me how to save my darling boy.
—Aye, now I have it: monitress divine,I thank thee:—yes; I wait but for the meansOf his escape, then fly this hated palace,Nor will return till I can call it mine.SCENE II.EDWARD, SUFFOLK.EDWARD.I fear we've gone too far: th' indignant WarwickIll brook'd our steady purpose; mark'd you, Suffolk,With what an eye of scorn he turn'd him from us,And lowr'd defiance—that prophetic woman!Half of her curse already is fulfill'd,And I have lost my friend.SUFFOLK.Some friends, perhaps,Are better lost: you'll pardon me, my liege,But, were it fitting, I could tell a taleWou'd soon convince you—Warwick is as weak—EDWARD.As Edward thou woud'st say.SUFFOLK.But 'twill distressThy noble heart too much, I dare not, Sir,Yet one day you must know it.EDWARD.Then by theeLet it be told me, Suffolk, thy kind handWill best administer the bitter draught:Go on, my Suffolk, speak, I charge thee, speak.SUFFOLK.That rival whom you wish'd me to discover—EDWARD.Aye, what of him? quick, tell me, hast thou foundThe happy traitor? give me but to knowThat I may wreak my speedy vengeance on him.SUFFOLK.Suppose that rival were the man whom mostYou lov'd, the man, perhaps, whom most you fear'd;Suppose 'twere—Warwick.EDWARD.Ha! it cannot be:I would not think it for a thousand worlds—Warwick in love with her, impossible!Now, Suffolk, do I fear thou speak'st from envyAnd jealous hatred at the noble Warwick,Not from the love of justice or of Edward;Where didst thou learn this falshood?SUFFOLK.From the lipsOf truth, from one whose honour and whose wordYou will not question; from—Elizabeth.EDWARD.From her! nay, then I fear—it must be so.SUFFOLK.When last I saw her, for again I wentBy your command, tho' hopeless of success,With all the little eloquence that IWas master of, I urg'd your ardent passion.Told her how much, how tenderly you lov'd her,And press'd with eagerness to know the causeOf her unkind refusal, till at lengthReluctantly, with blushes she confess'dThere was a cause;—she thank'd you for your goodness,'Twas more she said, much more than she deserv'd,
She ever shou'd revere her king: and ifShe had a heart to give it shou'd be—Edward's.EDWARD.So kind, and yet so cruel: well, go on.SUFFOLK.Then told me all the story of her love,That Warwick long had woo'd her—that her handWas promis'd; soon as he return'd from France,Though once her father cruelly opposed it,They were by his consent to be united.EDWARD.O never, Suffolk, may I live to seeThat dreadful hour! designing hypocrite.Are these his arts, is this the friend I lov'd?By heav'n! she shall be mine; I will assertA sov'reign's right, and tear her from him—whatIf he rebel—another civil war!'Tis terrible—O that I cou'd shake offThis cumbrous garb of majesty that clingsSo close around me, meet him man to man,And try who best deserves her! but when kingsGrow mad, their guiltless subjects pay the forfeit.Horrible thought—good Suffolk, for a whileI wou'd be private—therefore wait without,Let me have no intruders; above all,Keep Warwick from my sight—SCENE III.WARWICK, EDWARD.WARWICK.Behold him here;No welcome guest it seems, unless I ask
My lord of Suffolk's leave—there was a timeWhen Warwick wanted not his aid to gainAdmission here.EDWARD.There was a time perhaps,When Warwick more desired and more—deserv'd it.WARWICK.Never; I've been a foolish faithful slave;All my best years, the morning of my life,Hath been devoted to your service: whatAre now the fruits? disgrace and infamy;My spotless name which never yet the breathOf calumny had tainted, made the mockFor foreign fools to carp at: but 'tis fitWho trust in princes, shou'd be thus rewarded.EDWARD.I thought, my lord, I had full well repay'dYour services with honours, wealth, and pow'rUnlimited: thy all-directing handGuided in secret ev'ry latent wheelOf government, and mov'd the whole machine:Warwick was all in all, and pow'rless EdwardStood like a cypher in the great account.WARWICK.Who gave that cypher worth, and seated theeOn England's throne? thy undistinguish'd nameHad rotted in the dust from whence it sprang,And moulder'd in oblivion, had not WarwickDug from its sordid mine the useless ore,And stamp'd it with a diadem. Thou know'st,This wretched country, doom'd, perhaps, like Rome,To fall by its own self-destroying hand,Tost for so many years in the rough sea
Of civil discord, but for me had perish'd.In that distressful hour I seiz'd the helm,Bade the rough waves subside in peace, and steer'dYour shatter'd vessel safe into the harbour.You may despise, perhaps, that useless aidWhich you no longer want; but know, proud youth,He who forgets a friend, deserves a foe.EDWARD.Know too, reproach for benefits receiv'dPays ev'ry debt, and cancels obligation.WARWICK.Why, that indeed is frugal honesty,A thrifty saving knowledge, when the debtGrows burthensome, and cannot be discharg'd.A spunge will wipe out all, and cost you nothing.EDWARD.When you have counted o'er the numerous trainOf mighty gifts your bounty lavish'd on me,You may remember next the inj'riesWhich I have done you; let me know 'em all,And I will make you ample satisfaction.WARWICK.Thou can'st not; thou hast robb'd me of a jewelIt is not in thy pow'r to restore:I was the first, shall future annals say,That broke the sacred bond of public trustAnd mutual confidence; ambassadors,In after times, mere instruments, perhaps,Of venal statesmen, shall recal my nameTo witness, that they want not an example,And plead my guilt, to sanctify their own.Amidst the herd of mercenary slaves
That haunt your court, cou'd none be found but Warwick,To be the shameless herald of a lye?EDWARD.And woud'st thou turn the vile repoach on me?If I have broke my faith, and stain'd the nameOf England, thank thy own pernicious counselsThat urg'd me to it, and extorted from meA cold consent to what my heart abhor'd.WARWICK.I've been abus'd, insulted, and betray'd;My injur'd honour cries aloud for vengeance,Her wounds will never close!EDWARD.These gusts of passion,Will but inflame them; if I have been rightInform'd, my lord, besides these dang'rous scarsOf bleeding honour, you have other woundsAs deep, tho' not so fatal: such perhapsAs none but fair Elizabeth can cure.WARWICK.Elizabeth!EDWARD.Nay, start not, I have causeTo wonder most: I little thought indeedWhen Warwick told me I might learn to love,He was himself so able to instruct me:But I've discovered all.—WARWICK.And so have I;Too well I know thy breach of friendship there,Thy fruitless base endeavours to supplant me,EDWARD.I scorn it, sir,—Elizabeth hath charms,And I have equal right with you t'admire them:Nor see I ought so godlike in the form,So all-commanding in the name of Warwick,That he alone shou'd revel in the charmsOf beauty, and monopolize perfection.I knew not of your love.WARWICK.By heav'n, 'tis false!You knew it all, and meanly took occasion,Whilst I was busy'd in the noble office,Your grace thought fit to honour me withal.To tamper with a weak unguarded woman,To bribe her passions high, and basely stealA treasure which your kingdom cou'd not purchase.EDWARD.How know you that? but be it as it may,I had a right, nor will I tamely yieldMy claim to happiness, the privilege,To choose the partner of my throne and bed:It is a branch of my prerogative.WARWICK.Prerogative!—what's that? the boast of tyrants:A borrow'd jewel, glitt'ring in the crownWith specious lustre, lent but to betray,You had it, sir, and hold it—from the people.EDWARD.And therefore do I prize it; I wou'd guardTheir liberties, and they shall strengthen mine:But when proud faction and her rebel crewInsult their sov'reign, trample on his laws,And bid defiance to his pow'r, the people
In justice to themselves, will then defendHis cause, and vindicate the rights they gave.WARWICK.Go to your darling people then; for soon,If I mistake not, 'twill be needful; tryTheir boasted zeal, and see if one of themWill dare to lift his arm up in your cause,If I forbid them.EDWARD.Is it so, my lord,Then mark my words: I've been your slave too long,And you have rul'd me with a rod of iron,But henceforth know, proud peer, I am thy master,And will be so: the king, who delegatesHis pow'r to other's hands, but ill deservesThe crown he wears.WARWICK.Look well then to your own;It sits but loosely on your head, for know,The man who injur'd Warwick never pass'dUnpunish'd yet.EDWARD.Nor he who threaten'd Edward—You may repent it, Sir,—my guards there—seizeThis traitor, and convey him to the tow'r,There let him learn obedience.(Guards enter, seize Warwick, and endeavour to disarm him.WARWICK.Slaves, stand off:If I must yield my sword, I'll give it himWhom it so long has serv'd; there's not a partIn this old faithful steel, that is not stain'd
With English blood in grateful Edward's cause.Give me my chains, they are the bands of friendship,Of a king's friendship, for his sake a whileI'll wear them.EDWARD.Hence: away with him—WARWICK.'Tis well:Exert your pow'r, it may not last you long;For know, tho' Edward may forget his friend,That England will not.—now, sir, I attend you.[Exit Warwick.EDWARD.Presumptuous rebel—ha! who's here?SCENE IV.MESSENGER, EDWARD,MESSENGER.My liege;Queen Marg'ret with the prince her son are fled;In a few hours she hopes, for so we learn,From those who have pursued her, to be join'dBy th' earl of Warwick, in his name it seemsShe has already rais'd three thousand men.EDWARD.Warwick in league with her! O heav'n! 'tis wellWe've crush'd the serpent e'er his poison spreadThroughout our kingdom—guard the palace gates,Keep double watch; summon my troops together,Where is my brother Clarence, BuckinghamAnd Pembroke? we must check this foul rebellion—SCENE V.EDWARD SUFFOLK,.SUFFOLK.My liege, the duke of Clarence—EDWARD.What of him?SUFFOLK.Hath left the court; this moment I beheld himIn conf'rence deep with Pembroke, who, it seems,Is Marg'ret's firmest friend: 'tis whisper'd, bothWill join the queen.EDWARD.Well:—'tis no matter: IHave deeper cause for grief, he cannot feelA brother's falshood, who has lost a friend,A friend like Warwick,—Suffolk, thou behold'st meBetray'd, deserted by the man I lov'd;Treated with cold indifference by herWhom I ador'd, forsaken by my brother,And threaten'd by the subjects I protect,Oppress'd on every side: but, thou shalt see,I have a soul superior to misfortunes.Tho' rebel Clarence wrings my tortur'd heart,And faithless Warwick braves me, we will yetMaintain our right—come on, my friend, thou know'st,Without his boasted aid, I cou'd have gain'dThe crown, without him now I will preserve it.END of the THIRD ACT.ACT IV.SCENE, THE TOWER.WARWICK.MISTAKEN mortals plan delusive schemesOf bliss, and call futurity their own,Yet are not masters of a moment—thisWas the appointed time, the very dayWhich shou'd have join'd me to ElizabethIn nuptial bonds:—O cruel memory,Do not torment me—if there be a crimeOf deeper dye than all the guilty trainOf human vices, 'tis—ingratitude.'Tis now two years since Henry lost the crown,And here he is, ev'n in this very prisonA fellow captive now: disgraceful thought!How will he smile to meet his conqu'ror here!O for that stoic apathy which lullsThe drowsy soul to sweet forgetfulness!But 'twill not be:—Elizabeth, where art thou?Perhaps with Edward—O that thought distracts me:It is, I fear, as Marg'ret said; she's false.But when I look on these, can I expectTo find one virtue left in human kind?My Pembroke too! am I so soon forgotten?O no; he comes—SCENE II.PEMBROKE, WARWICK.PEMBROKE.My friend!WARWICK.My Pembroke, welcome:Thee I have ever found most just and kind;But, in the darkness of adversityThe jewel friendship shines with double lustre.PEMBROKE.I am not of the infect train that baskIn fortune's sunshine, and when ev'ning dampsArise, are seen no more: no, Warwick, whatI speak, I mean: you have been hardly treated.WARWICK.O! Pembroke, didst thou know but half the wrongsThat I have suffer'd, thou wou'dst pity me.PEMBROKE.I wou'd do more, much more, my Warwick: heWho only pities but insults the wretched;I come with nobler views, I come to tell thee,That I have felt thy inj'ries as my own,And will revenge them too.WARWICK.How kind thou artTo feel for Warwick!PEMBROKE.Ev'ry honest breastMust feel the inj'ries that a good man suffers:Thine is the common cause of all: adieuTo English freedom, when our liberty
Shall be dependent on a sov'reign's nod,When years of honest service shall be paidWith infamy and chains.WARWICK.I've not deserv'd them.PEMBROKE.Nor shalt thou wear them long: for thou hast greatAnd pow'rful friends—the noble duke of Clarence.Behold his signet—this, my Warwick, gain'd meAdmission here—we must be secret.WARWICK.Then I am not forsaken: Clarence!—Ha!PEMBROKE.Yes:The gallant youth, with honest zeal, declar'dHe lov'd his brother much, but justice more.WARWICK.Then, Edward, I defy thee: gen'rous Clarence!Thou know'st, the man who thus cou'd treat a friend,Wou'd soon forget a brother—but say, Pembroke,How stands the duke of Buckingham?PEMBROKE.Fast boundTo Edward; he and that smooth courtier SuffolkAre the two rotten pillars that supportHis tott'ring throne: but Marg'ret—WARWICK.Aye: how faresMy new ally? has she escaped the tyrant?PEMBROKE.She has: and by some wond'rous means contriv'dTo free her captive son.WARWICK.Tho' I abhor,I must admire that enterprising woman:Her active mind is ever on the wingIn search of fresh expedients, to recoverThe crown she lost.PEMBROKE.Already she has rais'dA pow'rful army; all the secret foesOf York's ambitious line rush forth in crowds,And join her standard: e'er to-morrow's sunShall dawn upon us, she will set thee free.WARWICK.O! Pembroke, nothing wounds the gen'rous mindSo deep as obligations to a foe.Is there no way to liberty, my friend,But through the bloody paths of civil war?PEMBROKE.I fear there is not.WARWICK.Then it must be so:I cou'd have wish'd—but freedom and revengeOn any terms are welcome.PEMBROKE.Here then join weOur hands—WARWICK.Our hearts.PEMBROKE.Now, Warwick, be thou firmIn thy resolves; let no unmanly fears,No foolish fond remembrance of past friendshipUnnerve thy arm, or shake thy steady purpose.WARWICK.No: by my wrongs it shall not: once, thou know'st,I lov'd him but too well, and these vile chainsAre my reward,—O give me but the useOf this once pow'rful arm, and thou shalt seeHow it shall punish falshood.—are thy forcesPrepar'd?PEMBROKE.They are, and wait but for my orders;Clarence will join us soon: our first great endIs to secure thy liberty; that done,We haste to seize the palace and redeemThe fair Elizabeth.WARWICK.Redeem her, ha!Is she a captive too?PEMBROKE.A willing slave;A gay state pris'ner, left to roam at largeO'er the young monarch's palace.WARWICK.Aye, my Pembroke,That's more inviting than a prison:—OShe's false, she's false—who sent her there?PEMBROKE.She cameIt seems, to thank him for his royal bountiesTo her good father, the new earl of Rivers,Who will no doubt persuade her to accept—WARWICK.Of Edward's hand—distraction! fly, my friend,Haste thee to Marg'ret, tell her if she hopes
For Warwick's aid, she must release him now,E'er Edward's ill-tim'd mercy shall prevent her.PEMBROKE.I go; my friend, adieu! when next we meet,I hope to bring thee liberty.WARWICK.Farewel.She's lost: she's gone: that base seducer Edward,Hath wrought on her weak mind, it must be so.SCENE III.MESSENGER, WARWICK.MESSENGER.My lord,The lady Elizabeth.WARWICK.Amazement! sureIt cannot be! admit her sir—why, what[Exit Mess.Cou'd bring her here? Edward has sent her hither,To see if I will crouch to him for pardon;Be still, my jealous heart.—SCENE IV.ELIZABETH, WARWICK.ELIZABETH.My Warwick!WARWICK.'Tis a grace I look'd not for,That a fair fav'rite, who so late had tasted
The pleasures of a court, shou'd condescendTo visit thus a poor abandon'd captive.ELIZABETH.I come to take my portion of misfortune,To pour the balm of comfort in, and healIf possible, the wounds which I had made.Too well I know, I was the fatal causeOf all thy sorrows,—but the noble Edward,For so indeed he is—WARWICK.And art thou come,To plead the cause of him who sent me hither?ELIZABETH.I came to be the messenger of peace,To calm thy troubled soul, and give thee rest,To teach my Warwick to forget his wrongs.WARWICK.Forget my wrongs! was that thy errand here,To teach me low submission to a tyrant;To ask forgiveness, kneel and deprecate,The wrath of blust'ring Edward? If thou com'stOn terms like these to bring me freedom, knowIt will not be accepted: now I seeThro' all your arts, by heav'n, I'd rather loseA thousand lives, than owe one to his bounty.ELIZABETH.Either my Warwick is much chang'd, and soI fear he is, or he wou'd never talkThus coldly to me, never wou'd despiseA life so precious, if he knew how muchElizabeth had suffer'd to preserve it.The gallant Edward won by my entreaties—WARWICK.Entreaties! didst thou then descend so low,As to entreat him for me?ELIZABETH.Hadst thou seen,When I implor'd him to forgive my Warwick,How kind he look'd, how his repenting heartHeav'd with the pangs of agonizing friendship,Thou wou'd'st have pity'd him.WARWICK.Deceitful woman,I see thy falshood now, I am betray'd,And thou art leagu'd with Edward to destroy me.Go to your royal lover and uniteThose only fit companions for each other,A broken friendship, and a perjur'd love:Give up discarded Warwick, and to makeThe compact firm, cement it with my blood.ELIZABETH.I thought the soul of Warwick far aboveSuch mean suspicions—shall the man, whose truth,Whose constancy, and love have been so longMy bright example, shall he stoop so low,As thus to listen to an idle taleTold by some prating courtier? if indeedThou cou'd'st believe it, I should pity thee.WARWICK.Where is your father, the new earl of Rivers?Why sends he not his forces to our aid?ELIZABETH.He cannot: honour, gratitude, forbid,That he shou'd lift up his rebellious armAgainst his benefactor! well thou know'st,
Of late, when civil discord reign'd among'st us,He fought with Henry, and with Henry fell:When injur'd Edward gen'rously forgave,Restor'd his forfeit lands, and late advanc'd himTo rank and title.WARWICK.Infamy and shame;The common nets which fearful knav'ry spreadsTo catch ambition's fools: mean sordid bribes!We know the treasure they were mean't to purchase.ELIZABETH.Unkind suggestion! how have I deserv'd it?Have I for this refus'd a youthful monarch,And spurn'd his offer'd sceptre at my feet,To be reproach'd at last by cruel Warwick?Had I once listen'd to him! had these eyesBeen dazzled with the splendor of a court,I need not thus have chang'd it for a dungeon.But since I am suspected, witness heav'n,And witness Warwick to my vows! henceforth,Dear as thou art, I cast thee from my love;Elizabeth will never wed—a traitor.WARWICK.Am I awake, and did ElizabethSay she wou'd never wed her faithful Warwick?Then bear me witness too, all judging heav'n!Here yield I up all visionary dreamsOf future bliss, of liberty, or life,Ev'n the sweet hope of vengeance that aloneSustain'd my spirit, loses all its charms;I wish'd for freedom but to purchase thine:For life, but to enjoy it with my love,And she disclaims me.WARWICK.Heav'n forbid! O Warwick,Let not the tide of passion thus overwhelmThy reason.WARWICK.Can'st thou pardon me? thou know'stTh' unguarded warmth, the weakness of my nature.I wou'd not wrong thee, but I've been so oftSo cruelly deceiv'dELIZABETH.I know thou hast;But never by Elizabeth.WARWICK.O no!It is impossible that perfidyShou'd wear a form like thine.(Looking at her.)I wonder notThat Edward lov'd, no; when I look on thee,All beauteous, all enchanting as thou art:By heav'n! I think I cou'd almost forgive him.ELIZABETH.Then wherefore not be reconcil'd?WARWICK.To whom?The author of my wrongs? It cannot be:Know, I have promis'd Marg'ret to destroy him.ELIZABETH.Destroy thy friend! ungen'rous cruel Warwick,Is't not enough that thou hast triumph'd here?Already we have pierc'd his noble heartWith the keen pangs of disappointed love:And woud'st thou wound his breast with added sorrows;Woud'st thou involve a nation in his ruin?WARWICK.Elizabeth, no more: alas! too wellThou know'st, there is a pow'rful advocateIn Warwick's breast, that pleads for perjur'd Edward.ELIZABETH.Cherish the soft emotion: O my Warwick!—WARWICK.That angel form can never plead in vain;But then, my friends—where is my solemn vowTo Marg'ret, and to Pembroke? there's the tie;My honour's dearer to me—ELIZABETH.Than thy love;Dearer, much dearer, than Elizabeth?But I have done: farewel, my lord, I seeThy deep resentment is not to be mov'dBy my weak influence o'er thee.(Going.)WARWICK.Stay, I charge thee.ELIZABETH.What is this phantom, honour, this proud idolThat tramples thus on ev'ry humble virtue?This cruel bloody Molock, that delightsIn human sacrifice? O! wou'd to heav'nI were its only victim! but with me,You offer up your country and your king.WARWICK.Think on my vow, think on my promise giv'n.ELIZABETH.Thy league with Marg'ret must be fatal: grantWe should succeed, and Lancaster once moreAssume the throne; how dear the victory,That's purchas'd with our fellow-subjects blood!
Alas! such triumphs make the conqu'ror weep.But if we fail—WARWICK.Impossible!ELIZABETH.O! thinkBetimes! what dreadful punishments awaitThe vanquish'd rebel: thou, perhaps, my love,Shalt then be doom'd on th' ignominious blockTo fall inglorious; and, when thou art gone,Who shall defend thy poor Elizabeth?WARWICK.Alarming thought! It staggers my firm purpose,And makes me half a villain.SCENE V.WARWICK, ELIZABETH, an OFFICER.OFFICER.Madam, the king demands your presence, IHave orders to convey you to the palace.WARWICK.And wilt thou leave me?ELIZABETH.This, my Warwick, thisIs the decisive moment, now determine,Accept of mercy, e'er it be too late;E'er hasty Edward—Shall, I say, thou wiltReturn to thy obedience, and receiveThy pardon? shall I? speak my love.WARWICK.PerhapsI may accept it, if 'tis brought by thee.ELIZABETH.Then we shall meet in happiness—WARWICK.Farewel!SCENE VI.WARWICK.Now to those worst companions in affliction,My own sad thoughts again, they're gloomy all,And like my habitation full of horror.I like not Edward's message—if he hearsMy league with Margaret, he still has pow'rTo make me feel his rage: I have deserv'd it—[a trampling heard without.Methought I heard a noise—this way they come,Perhaps it is the messenger of death—SCENE VII.PEMBROKE, WARWICK.PEMBROKE.The messenger of vengeance—see her sword;Accept it and be free.(offers the sword)WARWICK.First let me knowTo whom I am indebted for't.PEMBROKE.To me.Soon as the rumour of thy foul disgraceHad reach'd the public ear, th' impatient peopleUncertain of thy fate, tumultuous throng'dAround the palace, and demanded thee;Give us our Warwick, give us back, they cry'dOur hero, our deliv'rer—I step'd forthAnd bade them, instant, if they wish'd to save
The best of men, from infamy, and death,To follow me: transported they obey'd:I led them hither: forced the prison gates,And brought thee this—direct it as thou wilt.(Gives the sword.)WARWICK.Welcome once more, thou dearest gift of heav'nImmortal liberty! my friend, I thank thee.O Pembroke, woud'st thou had'st been here! my love,My dear Elizabeth is true.PEMBROKE.At leastYou think so.WARWICK.She has told me such sweet truths;Edward repents him sorely, he is griev'dAt his ingratitude.PEMBROKE.And well he may;I fear thou art betray'd: alas! my Warwick,Thy open gen'rous unsuspecting virtueThinks ev'ry heart as honest as thy own.Thou know'st not Edward—nor Elizabeth.The kingdom is in arms, and ev'ry hour,It is expected France will join the queen:England will want its great protector's aid.Edward and Rivers have conspired to cheatThy credulous ear, and who so fit to spreadThe flimsy web as thy Elizabeth,Their fair ambassadress? I see thou'rt caught.WARWICK.By heav'n! it may be so: I am the sportOf fortune and of fraud.PEMBROKE.Away, my friend:It is not now a time to think of her:Marg'ret, supported by thy pow'rful name,And join'd by Clarence, waits us at the headOf fifteen thousand men, who, eager allTo crush a tyrant, and pull down oppression,Attend thy wish'd-for presence; not a soldierWill act or move till Warwick shall direct them.Edward and England's fate depend on thee.WARWICK.Away my friend, I'll follow thee.[Exit Pembroke.Yet stopA moment—let not passion hurry meTo base dishonour—if my country callsFor Warwick's aid, shall I not hear her voice,And save her? Pembroke may have private views,And subtle Marg'ret too—Elizabeth!I must not lose thee—O! direct me heav'n!END of the FOURTH ACT.ACT V.SCENE I.ELIZABETH.THE royal pardon came too late, and PembrokeAlready has releas'd him; he is gone—Elizabeth may never see him more.A thousand terrors haunt me, a fond father,A guiltless sov'reign, a distracted lover,Fame, fortune, friends, and country, all dependOn one eventful moment—hark! the soundOf distant groans! perhaps the king—perhapsMy Warwick bleeds. O! agonizing thought!Great God of armies, whose all-guiding handDirects the fate of nations, O! look downOn thy own image, let not cruel discordDivide their kindred souls! in pity hear,Pour thy benignant spirit o'er their hearts,And once more knit them in the bonds of peace!SCENE II.ELIZABETH, SUFFOLK.SUFFOLK.The pray'r of innocence is always heard.ELIZABETH.Ha! Suffolk, whither hast'st thou? art thou come—SUFFOLK.I come to heal thy sorrows, lovely fair one,To tell thee, Edward, and thy much-lov'd Warwick,Once more are friends.ELIZABETH.Indeed! O welcome news!My joy's too great for utt'rance: tell me, Suffolk,How was it? speak, is Warwick safe? O heav'n!SUFFOLK.A moment's patience, and I'll tell thee all.Marg'ret, thou know'st, had rais'd a pow'rful force,That doubled Edward's troops: elate with pride,And almost sure of victory, she urg'dThe tardy spearmen; on they rush'd, as ifSecure of conquest: the unhappy kingStood nobly firm, and seem'd to brave his fate,When Warwick like a guardian god appear'd:His noble mien and all-commanding lookStruck deep attention; ev'ry eye was bentUpon him, and an awful silence reign'dO'er either host, he rais'd his voice on high,And stop, he cry'd, your sacrilegious hands,Nor touch my friend: who pierces Edward's breast,Must pass through mine: I rais'd him to the throne,And will support him there: to you I gave,From you my fellow-soldiers I expect him:Howe'er his cruel wrongs have wounded me,He never injur'd you, and, I—forgive him.He spake, and instant thro' the gazing croudA murmur ran; down dropp'd their nerveless arms,As if enchanted by some magic pow'r,And with one voice they cry'd, long live king Edward!ELIZABETH.How pow'rful is the tongue of eloquence,When in the cause of virtue!—well, what sollow'd?SUFFOLK.Encourag'd by the shouting soldiers, Edward
On like a modest virgin wishing came,Yet fearful, Warwick with a bridegroom's speedTo meet him flew; into each other's armsThey ran with speechless joy: the tender sceneAffected ev'ry heart, and the rough soldier,Unused to melting sympathy, forgotHis ruthless nature, and dissolv'd in tears.ELIZABETH.Sweet reconcilement! then, Elizabeth,Thou didst not plead in vain; but, say, how brook'dThe haughty queen this unexpected change?SUFFOLK.Abash'd, confounded, for a while she stroveTo stem the torrent, but in vain; then fledPrecipitate.ELIZABETH.But where, O where's my Warwick?SUFFOLK.With a few chosen squadrons he pursuesThe disappointed Marg'ret.ELIZABETH.O my fears!I know not why, but at that hateful nameI tremble ever, my foreboding heartPresages something dreadful.SUFFOLK.Do not vexThy tender mind with visionary dangers.ELIZABETH.O! wou'd to heav'n that he were shelter'd here,And safe within these arms!SUFFOLK.Be not alarm'd:
He is the care of heav'n: all good men love,All bad ones fear him.ELIZABETH.Such superior meritMust have a thousand foes, the constant markOf envy's poison'd darts.SUFFOLK.There Suffolk feelsThe keen reproach; with blushes I confessThere was a time, when, urg'd by fond ambition,I look'd on Warwick with a jealous eye:But this last noble deed hath won my heart,And I am now a convert to his virtues;But see, the king approaches.SCENE III.EDWARD, ELIZABETH.EDWARD.Health and peace,And happiness to fair Elizabeth!Thou art no stranger to the joyful news;The lustre of those speaking eyes declares it.ELIZABETH.Suffolk, ev'n now, hath bless'd me with the tidings.EDWARD.O! 'tis amazement all: Elizabeth,When last we met, thou wert the suppliant, now'Tis I must ask forgiveness, I who injur'dThe dearest, best of men; O! thou hast say'dEdward from shame, and England from destruction.ELIZABETH.Did I not say my Warwick wou'd be just?EDWARD.Thou did'st, and on those beauteous lips fair truthAnd soft persuasion dwell; long time he stoodInflexible, and deaf to friendship's voice,Listen'd to nought but all subduing love.In after-times, thy name shall be enroll'dAmongst the great deliv'rer's of their country.ELIZABETH.I have no title to the lavish praiseThy gen'rous heart bestows; I only saidWhat duty prompted, and what love inspir'd;Indulgent heav'n has crown'd it with success.EDWARD.Thou hast done all: I am indebted to theeFor more, much more than I can e'er repay.Long time, with shame, I own, hath Warwick soar'dAbove me, but I will not be outdoneFor ever by this proud aspiring rival:Poor as I am, there yet is one way leftTo pay the debt of gratitude I owe him,One great reward for such exalted virtues,Thyself, Elizabeth.ELIZABETH.What means my lord,My royal master?EDWARD.Yes; when next we meetI will bestow it on him, will resignAll my fond claim to happiness and thee;Tho' thy dear image ne'er can be effac'dFrom Edward's breast, tho' still I doat upon thee,Tho' I could hang for ever on thy beauties;Yet will I yield them to their rightful lord;Warwick has earn'd, Warwick alone deserves them.ELIZABETH.Wou'd he were here to thank thee for thy goodness!Know, gen'rous prince, Elizabeth has longAdmir'd thy virtues, and cou'd love admitOf a divided heart, the noble EdwardWou'd share it with his friend.SCENE IV.MESSENGER, EDWARD.MESSENGER.My royal liege,The rebels are dispers'd, queen Marg'ret's sonWas slain in the pursuit—and she—EDWARD.I hopeSecur'd—MESSENGER.Is taken pris'ner, and will soonBe here—EDWARD.But where's lord Warwick?MESSENGER.Sir—the queen—SCENE V.MARGARET Prisoner.MARGARET.Once more I am your pris'ner.EDWARD.'Twill be prudentHenceforth to keep you so.MARGARET.You dare not!Thou think'st, perhaps, that I shall sue to theeFor mercy: no; in Marg'ret of Anjou,Thou fee'st the wife, and daughter of a king.A spirit not to be subdu'd; tho fall'nTriumphant still, and tho' a pris'ner free.For know, I bear a mind above the reachOf fortune or of Edward—I have lostAll I cou'd wish to live for in my child;And gain'd what most I wish'd to gain, revenge!Or life or death are now indiff'rent to me.EDWARD.For thy unbounded goodness, pow'r supremeAccept our praise!ELIZABETH.(kneeling)Accept our humble pray'r!MARGARET.Insulting piety! the common trickOf hypocrites and slaves: when ye shall knowWhat Marg'ret knows, ye may not be so thankful.Methinks 'tis pity Warwick is not hereTo join in your devotion.ELIZABETH.Wou'd to heav'nHe were!MARGARET.That monster, that perfidious slaveWho broke his faith to Marg'ret, and to thee;Thy coward soul, unable to defendThe treasure thou hadst stol'n, cou'd meanly stoopTo court the traitor whom thou dar'st not punish.Not so the injur'd Marg'ret—she repell'dThe wrongs she felt, and the deceiver metThe fate he merited.EDWARD.What fate?—ev'n nowCrown'd with immortal wreaths, the hero comesTo bless his friends, and punish guilt like thine.MARGARET.Proud and deluded wretches! I look downWith pity on you: Captive as I am,'Tis mine to judge and punish; be it yoursTo hear and tremble.EDWARD.Ha!ELIZABETH.What can this mean?MARGARET.If I mistake not, Warwick is your friend,Your lover too, I think.ELIZABETH.My lord, my husband.MARGARET.Know then, that friend, that lover, perjur'd Warwick,Hath not an hour to live.EDWARD.What murth'rous hand—MARGARET.Mine, tyrant mine: think not I mean to hideThe noble deed; it is my happiness,It is my glory: thou wilt call me base,Blood-thirsty, cruel, savage, and revengeful.But here I stand acquitted to myself,And ev'ry feeling heart that knows my wrongs.—To late posterity dethroned queens,And weeping mothers shall applaud my justice.EDWARD.Justice, on whom?MARGARET.Can Edward ask me? whoImprison'd Henry, rob'd me of a crown,And plac'd it on a proud usurper's head?Who gave his sacred promise to a queen,And broke it? who, for which indignant heav'nChastis'd him, basely murther'd my sweet boy?Bereft of honour, fortune, husband, child,Depriv'd of ev'ry comfort, what remain'dFor me but vengeance, what for him but death?EDWARD.What hast thou done? when? where? speak, murthress, speak.MARGARET.Press'd by surrounding multitudes, and madeA slave, they dragg'd me to the conqu'ror's tent,There the first horrid object I beheld,Was the pale corse of my poor bleeding child:There—as th' insulting Warwick stood, and seem'dTo triumph o'er him—from my breast I drewA ponyard forth, and plung'd it in his heart.Th' astonish'd soldiers throng'd around him, seiz'dAnd brought me here—now to your pray'rs again.EDWARD.[Elizabeth faints.She faints, good Suffolk, help there, help, supportAssist her.—lead her in.[Exit Elizabeth.If it be true,As much I fear it is, a thousand deathsWere punishment too little for thy guilt;Thou shalt be tortur'd.MARGARET.Tyrant, I defy thee;Thy threats appall not me: prepare your tortures,Let them be sharp and cruel as thyself,

O! I will guard her with a parent's care,From every ill, watch over and protect her;And when the memory of thee shall awake,As oft it will, her poignant griefs, repelThe rising sigh, wipe off the flowing tear,And strive to charm her to forgetfulness.WARWICK.Wilt thou indeed? then I shall die in peace.ELIZABETH.Yet thou may'st live.WARWICK.Impossible:—I feelThe hand of death press cold upon my heart,And all will soon be o'er:—I've liv'd to saveMy falling country, to repent my crimes,Redeem my honour, and restore my king.EDWARD.Alas! my friend, the memory of theeWill poison every bliss.WARWICK.All-healing timeThat closes ev'ry wound, shall pour it's balmO'er thine.—mean-while, remember Warwick's fate.—I gave my word to Margaret, and broke it;Heav'n is not to be mock'd, it soon o'ertakes us,And in our crime we meet our punishment.O Edward, if thou hop'st that length of days,And fair prosperity shall crown thy wishes,Beware of passion, and resentment—makeThy people's good and happiness thy own,Discourage faction, banish flatt'rers, keepThy faith inviolate, and reign in peace.I can no more—my love! have mercy heav'n!(dies.)EDWARD.He's gone!—ELIZABETH.And with him all my hopes of bliss.EDWARD.Let ev'ry honour to a soldier due,Attend the hero to his tomb—mean-while,Deep in the living tablet of my heart,Will I engrave thy words—illustrious shade!Living thou wert my counsellor and friend,And dead I will remember, and obey thee.ELIZABETH.Warwick farewel, I shall not long survive thee.EDWARD.I hope thou wilt—Elizabeth, rememberHis dying charge, think on thy promise giv'n.Thou shall remain with me, with me lamentOur common benefactor; we will sitAnd talk together of my Warwick's virtues,For I will try to emulate them all,And learn, by copying him, to merit thee.His great example shall inspire my breastWith patriot zeal, shall teach me to subdueThe pow'r of faction, vanquish party rage,And make me, what alone I wish to be,The happy king of an united people.FINIS.EPILOGUE,Written by DAVID GARRICK, Esq Spoken by Mrs. YATES.EXHAUSTED quite with prisons, racks, and death,Permit me here to take a little breath!You who have seen my actions, known their springs,Say, are we women such insipid things?Say, lords of the creation, mighty men! have you surpass'd us, where? and when?I come to know to whom the palm is due,To us weak vessels, or to stronger you?Against your conqu'ring swords, I draw—my fan,Come on!—now parry Marg'ret, if you can.(Sets herself in a posture of defence.Stand up, ye boasters!
