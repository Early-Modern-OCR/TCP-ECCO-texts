DOUGLAS: A TRAGEDY.As it is acted at the THEATRE-ROYAL IN COVENT-GARDEN.Non ego sum vates, sed prisci conscius aevi.LONDON: Printed for A. MILLAR, in the Strand.MDCCLVII.PROLOGUE.Spoken by Mr. SPARKS.IN antient times, when Britain's trade was arms,And the lov'd musick of her youth, alarms.A god-like race sustain'd fair England's fame:Who has not heard of gallant PIERCY's name?Ay, and of DOUGLAS? Such illustrious foesIn rival Rome and Carthage never rose!From age to age bright shone the British fire,And every hero was a hero's sire.When powerful fate decreed one warrior's doom,Up sprung the Phoenix from his parent's tomb.But whilst these generous rivals fought and fell,These generous rivals lov'd each other well:Tho' many a bloody field was lost and won,Nothing in hate, in honour all was done.When PIERCY wrong'd defy'd his prince or peers,Fast came the DOUGLAS, with his Scottish spears;And, when proud DOUGLAS made his King his foe,For DOUGLAS, PIERCY bent his English bow.Expell'd their native homes by adverse fate,They knock'd alternate at each other's gate:Then blaz'd the castle, at the midnight hour,For him whose arms had shook its firmest tower.This night a DOUGLAS your protection claims;A wife! a mother! pity's softest names:The story of her woes indulgent hear,And grant your suppliant all she begs, a tear.In confidence she begs; and hopes to findEach English breast, like noble PIERCY's kind.DRAMATIS PERSONAE.Lord RANDOLPH, Mr. RIDOUT.GLENALVON, Mr. SMITH.NORVAL, DOUGLAS, Mr. BARRY.STRANGER, Mr. SPARKS.SERVANTS.WOMEN.MATILDA, Lady RANDOLPH, Mrs. WOFFINGTON.ANNA, Mrs. VINCENT.DRAMATIS PERSONAE, as represented at EDINBURGH.Lord RANDOLPH, Mr. YOUNGER.GLENALVON, Mr. LOVE.NORVAL, DOUGLAS, Mr. DIGGS.STRANGER, Mr. HAYMAN.SERVANTS, &c.WOMEN.MATILDA, Lady RANDOLPH, Mrs. WARD.ANNA, Mrs. HOPKINS.DOUGLAS: A TRAGEDY.ACT I.SCENE I.The court of a castle, surrounded with woods.Enter Lady RANDOLPH.YE woods and wilds, whose melancholy gloomAccords with my soul's sadness, and draws forthThe voice of sorrow from my bursting heart,Farewel a while: I will not leave you long;For in your shades I deem some spirit dwells,Who from the chiding stream, or groaning oak,Still hears, and answers to MATILDA's moan.O DOUGLAS! DOUGLAS! If departed ghostsAre e'er permitted to review this world,Within the circle of that wood thou art,And with the passion of immortals hear'stMy lamentation: hear'st thy wretched wifeWeep for her husband slain, her infant lost.My brother's timeless death I seem to mourn;Who perish'd with thee on this fatal day.To thee I lift my voice; to thee addressThe plaint which mortal ear has never heard.O disregard me not; though I am call'dAnother's now, my heart is wholly thine.Incapable of change, affection liesBuried, my DOUGLAS, in thy bloody grave.But RANDOLPH comes, whom fate has made my Lord,To chide my anguish, and defraud the dead.Enter Lord RANDOLPH.Again these weeds of woe! say, do'st thou wellTo feed a passion which consumes thy life?The living claim some duty; vainly thouBestow'st thy cares upon the silent dead.Lady RANDOLPH.Silent, alas! is he for whom I mourn:Childless, without memorial of his name,He only now in my remembrance lives.Lord RANDOLPH.Time, that wears out the trace of deepest anguish,Has past o'er thee in vain. Wou'd thou wer't notCompos'd of grief and tenderness alone!Sure thou art not the daughter of Sir MALCOLM:Strong was his rage, eternal his resentment:For when thy brother fell, he smil'd to hearThat DOUGLAS' son in the same field was slain.Lady RANDOLPH.Oh! rake not up the ashes of my fathers:Implacable resentment was their crime,And grievous has the expiation been.Contending with the DOUGLAS, gallant livesOf either house were lost; my ancestorsCompell'd, at last, to leave their ancient seatOn Tiviot's pleasant banks; and now, of themNo heir is left. Had they not been so stern,I had not been the last of all my race.Lord RANDOLPH.Thy grief wrests to its purposes my words.I never ask'd of thee that ardent love,Which in the breasts of fancy's children burns.Decent affection, and complacent kindnessWere all I wish'd for; but I wish'd in vain.Hence with the less regret my eyes beholdThe storm of war that gathers o'er this land:If I should perish by the Danish sword,MATILDA would not shed one tear the more.Lady RANDOLPH.Thou do'st not think so: woeful as I amI love thy merit, and esteem thy virtues.But whither goest thou now?Lord RANDOLPH.Straight to the camp,Where every warrior on the tip-toe standsOf expectation, and impatient asksEach who arrives, if he is come to tellThe Danes are landed.Lady RANDOLPH.O, may adverse winds,Far from the coast of Scotland, drive their fleet!And every soldier of both hosts returnIn peace and safety to his pleasant home!Lord RANDOLPH.Thou speak'st a woman's, hear a warrior's wish:Right from their native land, the stormy north,May the wind blow, till every keel is fix'dImmoveable in Caledonia's strand!Then shall our foes repent their bold invasion,And roving armies shun the fatal shore.Lady RANDOLPH.War I detest: but war with foreign foes,Whose manners, language, and whose looks are strange,Is not so horrid, nor to me so hateful,As that which with our neighbours oft we wage.A river here, there an ideal lineBy fancy drawn, divides the sister kingdoms.On each side dwells a people similar,As twins are to each other, valiant both,Both for their valour famous thro' the world.Yet will they not unite their kindred arms,And, if they must have war, wage distant war,But with each other fight in cruel conflict.Gallant in strife, and noble in their ire,The battle is their pastime. They go forthGay in the morning, as to summer sport:When ev'ning comes, the glory of the morn,The youthful warrior, is a clod of clay.Thus fall the prime of either hapless land;And such the fruit of Scotch and English wars.Lord RANDOLPH.I'll hear no more: this melody would makeA soldier drop his sword, and doff his arms,Sit down and weep the conquests he has made;Yea, (like a monk), sing rest and peace in heav'nTo souls of warriours in his battles slain.Lady, farewel: I leave thee not alone;Yonder comes one whose love makes duty light.Enter ANNA.ANNA.Forgive the rashness of your ANNA's love:Urg'd by affection, I have thus presum'dTo interrupt your solitary thoughts;And warn you of the hours that you neglect,And lose in sadness.Lady RANDOLPH.So to lose my hoursIs all the use I wish to make of time.ANNA.To blame thee, lady, suits not with my state:But sure I am, since death first prey'd on man,Never did sister thus a brother mourn.What had your sorrows been if you had lost,In early youth, the husband of your heart?Lady RANDOLPH.Oh!ANNA.Have I distrest you with officious love,And ill-tim'd mention of your brother's fate?Forgive me, lady: humble tho' I am,The mind I bear partakes not of my fortune:So fervently I love you, that to dryThese piteous tears, I'd throw my life away.Lady RANDOLPH.What power directed thy unconscious tongueTo speak as thou hast done? to name —ANNA.I know not:But since my words have made my mistress tremble,I will speak so no more; but silent mixMy tears with hers.Lady RANDOLPH.No, thou shalt not be silent.I'll trust thy faithful love, and thou shalt beHenceforth th' instructed partner of my woes.But what avails it? Can thy feeble pityRoll back the flood of never-ebbing time?Compell the earth and ocean to give upTheir dead alive?ANNA.What means my noble mistress?Lady RANDOLPH.Didst thou not ask what had my sorrows been?—If I in early youth had lost a husband? —In the cold bosom of the earth is lodg'd,Mangl'd with wounds, the husband of my youth;And in some cavern of the ocean lyesMy child and his.—ANNA.O! lady, most rever'd!The tale wrapt up in your amazing wordsDeign to unfold.Lady RANDOLPH.Alas! an ancient feud,Hereditary evil, was the sourceOf my misfortunes. Ruling fate decreed,That my brave brother should in battle saveThe life of DOUGLAS' son, our house's foe:The youthful warriours vow'd eternal friendship.To see the vaunted sister of his friendImpatient, DOUGLAS to Balarmo came,Under a borrow'd name.—My heart he gain'd;Nor did I long refuse the hand he begg'd:My brother's presence authoriz'd our marriage.Three weeks, three little weeks, with wings of down,Had o'er us flown, when my lov'd lord was call'dTo fight his father's battles; and with him,In spite of all my tears, did MALCOLM go.Scarce were they gone, when my stern sire was toldThat the false stranger was lord DOUGLAS' son.Frantic with rage, the baron drew his swordAnd question'd me. Alone, forsaken, faint,Kneeling beneath his sword, fault'ring I tookAn oath equivocal, that I ne'er wouldWed one of DOUGLAS name. SincerityThou first of virtues, let no mortal leaveThy onward path! altho' the earth should gape,And from the gulf of hell destruction cryTo take dissimulation's winding way.ANNA.Alas! how few of woman's fearful kindDurst own a truth so hardy!Lady RANDOLPH.The first truthIs easiest to avow. This moral learn,This precious moral, from my tragic tale.—In a few days the dreadful tidings cameThat DOUGLAS and my brother both were slain.My lord! my life! my husband!—mighty God!What had I done to merit such affliction?ANNA.My dearest lady! Many a tale of tearsI've listen'd to; but never did I hearA tale so sad as this.Lady RANDOLPH.In the first daysOf my distracting grief, I found myself—As women wish to be who love their lords.But who durst tell my father? The good priestWho join'd our hands, my brother's antient tutour,With his lov'd MALCOLM, in the battle fell:They two alone were privy to the marriage.On silence and concealment I resolv'd,Till time should make my father's fortune mine.That very night on which my son was born,My nurse, the only confident I had,Set out with him to reach her sister's house:But nurse, nor infant, have I ever seen,Or heard of, ANNA, since that fatal hour.My murder'd child!—had thy fond mother fear'dThe loss of thee, she had loud fame defy'd,Despis'd her father's rage, her father's grief,And wander'd with thee thro' the scorning world.ANNA.Not seen, nor heard of! then perhaps he lives.Lady RANDOLPH.No. It was dark December: wind and rainHad beat all night. Across the Carron layThe destin'd road; and in it's swelling floodMy faithful servant perish'd with my child.O hapless son! of a most hapless sire!—But they are both at rest; and I aloneDwell in this world of woe, condemn'd to walk,Like a guilt-troubl'd ghost, my painful rounds:Nor has despiteful fate permitted meThe comfort of a solitary sorrow.Tho' dead to love, I was compell'd to wedRANDOLPH, who snatch'd me from a villain's arms;And RANDOLPH now possesses the domains,That by Sir MALCOLM's death on me devolv'd;Domains, that should to DOUGLAS' son have giv'nA baron's title, and a baron's power.Such were my foothing thoughts, while I bewail'dThe slaughter'd father of a son unborn.And when that son came, like a ray from heav'n,Which shines and disappears; alas! my child!How long did thy fond mother grasp the hopeOf having thee, she knew not how, restor'd.Year after year hath worn her hope away;But left still undiminish'd her desire.ANNA.The hand, that spins th' uneven thread of life,May smooth the length that's yet to come of your's.Lady RANDOLPH.Not in this world: I have consider'd wellIts various evils, and on whom they fall.Alas! how oft does goodness wound itself?And sweet affection prove the spring of woeO! had I died when my lov'd husband fell!Had some good angel op'd to me the bookOf providence, and let me read my life,My heart had broke, when I beheld the sumOf ills, which one by one I have endur'd.ANNA.That God, whose ministers good angels are,Hath shut the book in mercy to mankind.But we must leave this theme: GLENALVON comes:I saw him bend on you his thoughtful eyes,And hitherwards he slowly stalks his way.Lady RANDOLPH.I will avoid him. An ungracious personIs doubly irksome in an hour like this.ANNA.Why speaks my lady thus of RANDOLPH's heir?Lady RANDOLPH.Because he's not the heir of RANDOLPH's virtues.Subtle and shrewd, he offers to mankindAn artificial image of himself:And he with ease can vary to the tasteOf different men, it's features. Self-denied,And master of his appetites he seems:But his fierce nature, like a fox chain'd up,Watches to seize unseen the wish'd-for prey.Never were vice and virtue pois'd so ill,As in GLENALVON's unrelenting mind.Yet is he brave and politic in war,And stands aloft in these unruly times.Why I describe him thus I'll tell hereafter;Stay and detain him till I reach the castle.Exit Lady RANDOLPH.ANNA.O happiness! where art thou to be found?I see thou dwellest not with birth and beauty,Tho' grac'd with grandeur, and in wealth array'd:Nor dost thou, it would seem, with virtue dwell;Else had this gentle lady miss'd thee not.Enter GLENALVON.GLENALVON.What dost thou muse on, meditating maid?Like some entranc'd and visionary seerOn earth thou stand'st, thy thoughts ascend to heaven.ANNA.Wou'd that I were, e'en as thou say'st, a seer,To have my doubts by heav'nly vision clear'd!GLENALVON.What dost thou doubt of? what hast thou to doWith subjects intricate? Thy youth, thy beauty,Cannot be questioned: think of these good gifts;And then thy contemplations will be pleasing.ANNA.Let women view yon monument of woe,Then boast of beauty: who so fair as she?But I must follow: this revolving dayAwakes the memory of her ancient woes.Exit ANNA.GLENALVONsolus.So!—Lady RANDOLPH shuns me; by and byI'll woo her as the lion wooes his brides.The deed's a doing now, that makes me lordOf these rich valleys, and a chief of power.The season is most apt; my sounding stepsWill not be heard amidst the din of arms.RANDOLPH has liv'd too long: his better fateHad the ascendant once, and kept me down:When I had seiz'd the dame, by chance he came,Rescu'd and had the lady for his labour;I 'scap'd unknown: a slender consolation!Heaven is my witness that I do not loveTo sow in peril, and let others reapThe jocund harvest. Yet I am not safe:By love, or something like it, stung, inflam'd,Madly I blabb'd my passion to his wife,And she has threaten'd to acquaint him of it.The way of woman's will I do not know:But well I know the baron's wrath is deadly.I will not live in fear: the man I dreadIs as a Dane to me; ay, and the manWho stands betwixt me and my chief desire.No bar but he; she has no kinsman near;No brother in his sister's quarrel bold;And for the righteous cause, a stranger's cause,I know no chief that will defy GLENALVON.End of the FIRST ACT.ACT II.SCENE I.A Court, &c.Enter servants and a stranger at one door, and Lady RANDOLPH and ANNA at another.Lady RANDOLPH.WHAT means this clamour? stranger, speak secure;Hast thou been wrong'd? have these rude men presum'dTo vex the weary traveller on his way?First SERVANT.By us no stranger ever suffer'd wrong:This man with outcry wild has call'd us forth;So sore afraid he cannot speak his fears.Enter Lord RANDOLPH and young man, with their swords drawn and bloody.Lady RANDOLPH.Not vain the stranger's fears! how fares my lord?Lord RANDOLPH.That it fares well, thanks to this gallant youth,Whose valour sav'd me from a wretched death!As down the winding dale I walk'd alone,At the cross way four armed men attack'd me:Rovers, I judge, from the licentious camp,Who would have quickly laid Lord RANDOLPH low,Had not this brave and generous stranger come,Like my good angel in the hour of fate,And, mocking danger, made my foes his own.They turn'd upon him: but his active armStruck to the ground, from whence they rose no more,The fiercest two; the others fled amain,And left him master of the bloody field.Speak, Lady RANDOLPH: upon Beauty's tongueDwell accents pleasing to the brave and bold.Speak, noble dame, and thank him for thy lord.Lady RANDOLPH.My lord, I cannot speak what now I feel.My heart o'erflows with gratitude to heav'n,And to this noble youth, who all unknownTo you and yours, deliberated not,Nor paus'd at peril, but humanely braveFought on your side, against such fearful odds.Have you yet learn'd of him whom we should thank?Whom call the saviour of Lord RANDOLPH's life?Lord RANDOLPH.I ask'd that question, and he answer'd not:But I must know who my deliverer is.
(to the Stranger)STRANGER.A low born man, of parentage obscure,Who nought can boast but his desire to beA soldier, and to gain a name in arms.Lord RANDOLPH.Whoe'er thou art, thy spirit is ennobledBy the great King of Kings! thou art ordain'dAnd stampt a hero by the sovereign handOf nature! blush not, flower of modestyAs well as valour, to declare thy birth.STRANGER.My name is NORVAL: on the Grampian hillsMy father feeds his flocks; a frugal swain,Whose constant cares were to encrease his store,And keep his only son, myself, at home.For I had heard of battles, and I long'dTo follow to the field some warlike lord;And heaven soon granted what my sire denied.This moon which rose last night, round as my shield,Had not yet fill'd her horns, when, by her light,A band of fierce barbarians, from the hills,Rush'd like a torrent down upon the vale,Sweeping our flocks and herds. The shepherds fledFor safety, and for succour. I alone,With bended bow, and quiver full of arrows,Hover'd about the enemy, and mark'dThe road he took, then hasted to my friends;Whom, with a troop of fifty chosen men,I met advancing. The pursuit I led,Till we o'ertook the spoil-encumber'd foe.We fought and conquer'd. E're a sword was drawn,An arrow from my bow had pierc'd their chief,Who wore that day the arms which now I wear.Returning home in triumph, I disdain'dThe shepherd's slothful life; and having heardThat our good king had summon'd his bold peersTo lead their warriours to the Carron side,I left my father's house, and took with meA chosen servant to conduct my steps:—Yon trembling coward who forsook his master.Journeying with this intent, I past these towers.And, heaven-directed, came this day to doThe happy deed that gilds my humble name.Lord RANDOLPH.He is as wise as brave. Was ever taleWith such a gallant modesty rehears'd?My brave deliverer! thou shalt enter nowA nobler list, and in a monarch's sightContend with princes for the prize of fame.I will present thee to our Scottish king,Whose valiant spirit ever valour lov'd.Ha! my MATILDA! wherefore starts that tear?Lady RANDOLPH.I cannot say: for various affections,And strangely mingled, in my bosom swell;Yet each of them may well command a tear.I joy that thou art safe; and admireHim and his fortunes who hath wrought thy safety.Obscure and friendless, he the army sought,Bent upon peril, in the range of deathResolv'd to hunt for fame, and with his swordTo gain distinction which his birth denied.In this attempt unknown he might have perish'd,And gain'd, with all his valour, but oblivion.Now grac'd by thee, his virtue serves no moreBeneath despair. The soldier now of hopeHe stands conspicuous; fame and great renownAre brought within the compass of his sword.On this my mind reflected, whilst you spoke,And bless'd the wonder-working Lord of heaven.Lord RANDOLPH.Pious and grateful ever are thy thoughts!My deeds shall follow where thou point'st the way.Next to myself, and equal to GLENALVON,In honour and command shall NORVAL be.NORVAL.I know not how to thank you. Rude I am,In speech and manners: never till this hourStood I in such a presence: yet, my lord,There's something in my breast which makes me boldTo say, that NORVAL ne'er will shame thy favour.Lady RANDOLPH.I will be sworn thou wilt not. Thou shalt beMy knight; and ever, as thou didst to-day,With happy valour guard the life of RANDOLPH.Lord RANDOLPH.Well hast thou spoke. Let me forbid reply.
To NORVAL.We are thy debtors still; thy high desertO'ertops our gratitude. I must proceed,As was at first intended, to the camp.Some of my train I see are speeding hither,Impatient, doubtless, of their lord's delay.Go with me, NORVAL, and thine eyes shall seeThe chosen warriors of thy native land,Who languish for the fight, and beat the airWith brandish'd swords.NORVAL.Let us begone, my lord.Lord RANDOLPH.To Lady RANDOLPH.About the time that the declining sunShall his broad orbit o'er yon hills suspend,Expect us to return. This night once moreWithin these walls I rest; my tent I pitchTo-morrow in the field. Prepare the feast.Free is his heart who for his country fights:He in the eve of battle may resignHimself to social pleasure; sweetest then,When danger to a soldier's soul endearsThe human joy that never may return.Exeunt RANDOLPH and NORVAL.SCENE II.Lady RANDOLPH and ANNA.Lady RANDOLPH.His parting words have struck a fatal truth.O DOUGLAS! DOUGLAS! tender was the timeWhen we two parted, ne'er to meet again!How many years of anguish and despairHas heav'n annex'd to those swift passing hoursOf love and fondness! Then my bosom's flameOft, as blown back by the rude breath of fear,Return'd, and with redoubled ardour blaz'd.ANNA.May gracious heav'n pour the sweet balm of peaceInto the wounds that fester in your breast!For earthly consolation cannot cure them.Lady RANDOLPH.One only cure can heav'n itself bestow;—A grave—that bed in which the weary rest.Wretch that I am! Alas! why am I so?At every happy parent I repine!How blest the mother of yon gallant NORVAL!She for a living husband bore her pains,And heard him bless her when a man was born:She nurs'd her smiling infant on her breast;Tended the child, and rear'd the pleasing boy:She, with affection's triumph, saw the youthIn grace and comeliness surpass his peers:Whilst I to a dead husband bore a son,And to the roaring waters gave my child.ANNA.Alas! alas! why will you thus resumeYour grief afresh? I thought that gallant youthWould for a while have won you from your woe.On him intent you gazed, with a lookMuch more delighted, than your pensive eyeHas deign'd on other objects to bestow.Lady RANDOLPH.Delighted say'st thou? Oh! even there mine eyeFound fuel for my life-consuming sorrow.I thought, that had the son of DOUGLAS liv'd,He might have been like this young gallant stranger,And pair'd with him in features and in shape,In all endowments, as in years, I deem,My boy with blooming NORVAL might have number'd.Whilst thus I mus'd, a spark from fancy fellOn my sad heart, and kindled up a fondnessFor this young stranger, wand'ring from his home,And like an orphan cast upon my care.I will protect thee, (said I to myself)With all my power, and grace with all my favour.ANNA.Sure heav'n will bless so gen'rous a resolve.You must, my noble dame, exert your power:You must awake: devices will be fram'd,And arrows pointed at the breast of NORVAL.Lady RANDOLPH.GLENALVON's false and crafty head will workAgainst a rival in his kinsman's love,If I deter him not: I only can.Bold as he is, GLENALVON will bewareHow he pulls down the fabric that I raise.I'll be the artist of young NORVAL's fortune.'Tis pleasing to admire! most apt was ITo this affection in my better days;Though now I seem to you shrunk up, retir'dWithin the narrow compass of my woe.Have you not sometimes seen an early flowerOpen it's bud, and spread it's silken leaves,To catch sweet airs, and odours to bestow;Then, by the keen blast nipt, pull in it's leaves,And, tho' still living, die to scent and beauty?Emblem of me: affliction, like a storm,Hath kill'd the forward blossom of my heart.Enter GLENALVON.GLENALVON.Where is my dearest kinsman, noble RANDOLPH?Lady RANDOLPH.Have you not heard, GLENALVON, of the base—GLENALVON.I have: and that the villains may not scape,With a strong band I have begirt the wood.If they lurk there, alive they shall be taken,And torture force from them th' important secretWhether some foe of RANDOLPH hir'd their swords,Or if—Lady RANDOLPH.That care becomes a kinsman's love.I have a counsel for GLENALVON's ear.
(Exit ANNA.)GLENALVON.To him your counsels always are commands.Lady RANDOLPH.I have not found so: thou art known to me.GLENALVON.Known!Lady RANDOLPH.And most certain is my cause of knowledge.GLENALVON.What do you know? By the most blessed cross,You much amaze me. No created thing,Yourself except, durst thus accost GLENALVON.Lady RANDOLPH.Is guilt so bold? and dost thou make a meritOf thy pretended meekness? This to me,Who, with a gentleness which duty blames,Have hitherto conceal'd what, if divulg'd,Would make thee nothing; or, what's worse than that,An outcast beggar, and unpitied too:For mortals shudder at a crime like thine.GLENALVON.Thy virtue awes me. First of womankind!Permit me yet to say, that the fond manWhom love transports beyond strict virtue's bounds,If he is brought by love to misery,In fortune ruin'd, as in mind forlorn,Unpitied cannot be. Pity's the almsWhich on such beggars freely is bestow'd:For mortals know that love is still their lord,And o'er their vain resolves advances still:As fire, when kindled by our shepherds, movesThro' the dry heath before the fanning wind.Lady RANDOLPH.Reserve these accents for some other ear.To love's apology I listen not.Mark thou my words; for it is meet thou should'st.His brave deliverer RANDOLPH here retains.Perhaps his presence may not please thee well:But, at thy peril, practise ought against him:Let not thy jealousy attempt to shakeAnd loosen the good root he has in RANDOLPH;Whose favourites I know thou hast supplanted.Thou look'st at me, as if thou fain would'st pryInto my heart. 'Tis open as my speech.I give this early caution, and put onThe curb, before thy temper breaks away.The friendless stranger my protection claims:His friend I am, and be not thou his foe.
Exit.SCENE III.Manet GLENALVON.Child that I was, to start at my own shadow,And be the shallow fool of coward conscience!I am not what I have been; what I should be.The darts of destiny have almost pierc'dMy marble heart. Had I one grain of faithIn holy legends, and religious tales,I should conclude there was an arm aboveThat fought against me, and malignant turn'd,To catch my self, the subtle snare I set.Why, rape and murder are not simple means!Th' imperfect rape to RANDOLPH gave a spouse;And the intended murder introduc'dA favourite to hide the sun from me;And worst of all, a rival. Burning hell!This were thy center, if I thought she lov'd him!'Tis certain she contemns me; nay commands me,And waves the flag of her displeasure o'er me,In his behalf. And shall I thus be brav'd?Curb'd, as she calls it, by dame chastity?Infernal fiends, if any fiends there areMore fierce than love, ambition, and revenge,Rise up and fill my bosom with your firesAnd policy remorseless! Chance may spoilA single aim; but perseverance mustProsper at last. For chance and fate are words:Persistive wisdom is the fate of man.Darkly a project peers upon my mind,Like the red moon when rising in the east,Cross'd and divided by strange-colour'd clouds.I'll seek the slave who came with NORVAL hither,And for his cowardice was spurned from him.I've known a follower's rankled bosom breedVenom most fatal to his heedless lord.
Exit.End of the SECOND ACT.ACT III.SCENE I.A Court, &c. as before.Enter ANNA.ANNA.THY vassals, Grief! great nature's order break,And change the noon-tide to the midnight hour.Whilst Lady RANDOLPH sleeps I will walk forth,And taste the air that breathes on yonder bank.Sweet may her slumbers be! Ye ministersOf gracious heaven who love the human race,Angels and seraphs who delight in goodness!Forsake your skies, and to her couch descend!There from her fancy chase those dismal formsThat haunt her waking; her sad spirit charmWith images celestial, such as pleaseThe blest above upon their golden beds.Enter SERVANT.SERVANT.One of the vile assassins is secur'd.We found the villain lurking in the wood:With dreadful imprecations he deniesAll knowledge of the crime. But this is notHis first essay: these jewels were conceal'dIn the most secret places of his garment;Belike the spoils of some that he has murder'd.ANNA.Let me look on them. Ha! here is a heart,The chosen crest of DOUGLAS' valiant name!These are no vulgar jewels. Guard the wretch.Exit ANNA.Enter servants with a Prisoner.PRISONER.I know no more than does the child unbornOf what you charge me with.First SERVANT.You say so, sir!But torture soon shall make you speak the truth.Behold the Lady of Lord RANDOLPH comes:Prepare yourself to meet her just revenge.SCENE II.Enter Lady RANDOLPH and ANNA.ANNA.Summon your utmost fortitude, beforeYou speak with him. Your dignity, your fame,Are now at stake. Think of the fatal secret,Which in a moment from your lips may fly.Lady RANDOLPH.Thou shalt behold me, with a desperate heart,Hear how my infant perish'd. See he kneels.[The prisoner kneels.]PRISONER.Heav'n bless that countenance, so sweet and mild!A judge like thee makes innocence more bold.O save me, lady! from these cruel men,Who have attack'd and seiz'd me; who accuseMe of intended murder. As I hopeFor mercy at the judgment seat of God,The tender lamb, that never nipt the grass,Is not more innocent than I of murder.Lady RANDOLPH.Of this man's guilt what proof can ye produce?First SERVANT.We found him lurking in the hollow Glynn.When view'd and call'd upon, amaz'd, he fled.We overtook him, and enquir'd from whenceAnd what he was: he said he came from far,And was upon his journey to the camp.Not satisfied with this, we search'd his cloaths,And found these jewels; whose rich value pleadMost powerfully against him. Hard he seemsAnd old in villainy. Permit us tryHis stubborness against the torture's force.PRISONER.O gentle lady! by your lord's dear life!Which these weak hands, I swear, did ne'er assail;And by your children's welfare, spare my age!Let not the iron tear my ancient joints,And my grey hairs bring to the grave with pain.Lady RANDOLPH.Account for these: thine own they cannot be:For these, I say: be stedfast to the truth;Detected falsehood is most certain death.[ANNA removes the servants and returns.]PRISONER.Alas! I'm fore beset! let never man,For sake of lucre, sin against his soul!Eternal justice is in this most just!I, guiltless now, must former guilt reveal.Lady RANDOLPH.O! ANNA hear!—once more I charge thee speakThe truth direct: for these to me foretellAnd certify a part of thy narration;With which if the remainder tallies not,An instant and a dreadful death abides thee.PRISONER.Then, thus adjur'd, I'll speak to you as justAs if you were the minister of heaven,Sent down to search the secret sins of men.Some eighteen years ago, I rented landOf brave Sir MALCOLM, then BALARMO's lord;But falling to decay, his servants seiz'dAll that I had, and then turn'd me and mine,(Four helpless infants and their weeping mother)Out to the mercy of the winter winds.A little hovel by the river's sideReceiv'd us: there hard labour, and the skillIn fishing, which was formerly my sport,Supported life. Whilst thus we poorly liv'd,One stormy night, as I remember well,The wind and rain beat hard upon our roof:Red came the river down, and loud and oftThe angry spirit of the water shrick'd.At the dead hour of night was heard the cryOf one in jeopardy. I rose, and ranTo where the circling eddy of a poolBeneath the ford, us'd oft to bring withinMy reach whatever floating thing the streamHad caught. The voice was ceas'd; the person lost:But looking sad and earnest on the waters,By the moon's light I saw, whirl'd round and round,A basket: soon I drew it to the bank,And nestled curious there an infant lay.Lady RANDOLPH.Was he alive?PRISONER.He was.Lady RANDOLPH.Inhuman that thou art!How couldst thou kill what waves and tempests spar'd?PRISONER.I am not so inhuman.Lady RANDOLPH.Didst thou not?ANNA.My noble mistress, you are mov'd too much:This man has not the aspect of stern murder;Let him go on, and you, I hope, will hearGood tidings of your kinsman's long lost child.PRISONER.The needy man, who has known better days,One whom distress has spited at the world,Is he whom tempting fiends would pitch uponTo do such deeds, as makes the prosperous menLift up their hands and wonder who could do them.And such a man was I; a man declin'd,Who saw no end of black adversity:Yet, for the wealth of kingdoms, I would notHave touch'd that infant, with a hand of harm.Lady RANDOLPH.Ha! dost thou say so? Then perhaps he lives!PRISONER.Not many days ago he was alive.Lady RANDOLPH.O! God of heav'n! Did he then die so lately?PRISONER.I did not say he died; I hope he lives.Not many days ago these eyes beheldHim, flourishing in youth, and health, and beauty.Lady RANDOLPH.Where is he now?PRISONER.Alas! I know not where.Lady RANDOLPH.Oh fate! I fear thee still. Thou riddler, speakDirect and clear; else I will search thy soul.ANNA.Permit me, ever honour'd! Keen impatience,Tho' hard to be restrain'd, defeats itself.—Pursue thy story with a faithful tongue,To the last hour that thou didst keep the child.PRISONER.Fear not my faith, tho' I must speak my shame.Within the cradle, where the infant lay,Was stow'd a mighty store of gold and jewels;Tempted by which we did resolve to hide,From all the world, this wonderful event,And like a peasant breed the noble child.That none might mark the change of our estate,We left the country, travell'd to the north,Bought flocks and herds, and gradually brought forthOur secret wealth, But God's all-seeing eyeBeheld our avarice, and smote us sore.For one by one all our own children died,And he, the stranger, sole remain'd the heirOf what indeed was his. Fain then would I,Who with a father's fondness lov'd the boy,Have trusted him, now in the dawn of youth,With his own secret: but my anxious wife,Foreboding evil, never would consent.Mean while the stripling grew in years and beauty;And, as we oft observ'd, he bore himself,Not as the offspring of our cottage blood;For nature will break out: mild with the mild,But with the froward he was fierce as fire,And night and day he talk'd of war and arms.I set myself against his warlike bent;But all in vain: for when a desperate bandOf robbers from the savage mountains came —Lady RANDOLPH.Eternal providence! What is thy name?PRISONER.My name is NORVAL; and my name he bears,Lady RANDOLPH.'Tis he; 'tis he himself! It is my son!O sovereign mercy! 'Twas my child I saw!No wonder, ANNA, that my bosom burn'd.ANNA.Just are your transports: ne'er was woman's heartProv'd with such fierce extremes. High fated dame!But yet remember that you are beheldBy servile eyes; your gestures may be seenImpassion'd, strange; perhaps your words o'erheard.Lady RANDOLPH.Well dost thou counsel, ANNA: Heaven bestowOn me that wisdom which my state requires!ANNA.The moments of deliberation pass,And soon you must resolve. This useful manMust be dismiss'd in safety, e'er my lordShall with his brave deliverer return.PRISONER.If I, amidst astonishment and fear,Have of your words and gestures rightly judg'd,Thou art the daughter of my ancient master;The child I rescu'd from the flood is thine.Lady RANDOLPH.With thee dissimulation now were vain.I am indeed the daughter of Sir MALCOLM;The child thou rescu'dst from the flood is minePRISONER.Blest be the hour that made me a poor man!My poverty hath sav'd my master's house!Lady RANDOLPH.Thy words surprize me: sure thou dost not feign:The tear stands in thine eye: such love from theeSir MALCOLM's house deserv'd not; if arightThou told'st the story of thy own distress.PRISONER.Sir MALCOLM of our barons was the flower;The fastest friend, the best and kindest master.But ah! he knew not of my sad estate.After that battle, where his gallant son,Your own brave brother, fell, the good old lordGrew desperate and reckless of the world;And never, as he erst was wont, went forthTo overlook the conduct of his servants.By them I was thrust out, and them I blame:May heaven so judge me as I judg'd my master!And God so love me as I love his race!Lady RANDOLPH.His race shall yet reward thee. On thy faithDepends the fate of thy lov'd master's house.Rememb'rest thou a little lonely hut,That like a holy hermitage appearsAmong the clifts of Carron?PRISONER.I rememberThe cottage of the clifts.Lady RANDOLPH.'Tis that I mean:There dwells a man of venerable age,Who in my father's service spent his youth:Tell him I sent thee, and with him remain,'Till I shall call upon thee to declare,Before the king and nobles, what thou nowTo me hast told. No more but this, and thouShalt live in honour all thy future days;Thy son so long shall call thee father still,And all the land shall bless the man, who sav'dThe son of DOUGLAS, and Sir MALCOLM'S heir.Remember well my words: if thou shouldst meetHim whom thou call'st thy son, still call him so;And mention nothing of his nobler father.PRISONER.Fear not that I shall mar so fair an harvest,By putting in my sickle 'ere 'tis ripe.Why did I leave my home and ancient dame?To find the youth, to tell him all I knew,And make him wear these jewels in his arms;Which might, I thought, be challeng'd, and so bringTo light the secret of his noble birth.Lady RANDOLPH goes towards the Servants.Lady RANDOLPH.This man is not th'assassin you suspected,Tho' chance combin'd some likelyhoods against him.He is the faithful bearer of the jewelsTo their right owner, whom in haste he seeks.'Tis meet that you should put him on his way,Since your mistaken zeal hath dragg'd him hither.Exeunt Stranger and Servants▪SCENE III.Lady RANDOLPH and ANNA.Lady RANDOLPH.My faithful ANNA! dost thou share my joy?I know thou dost. Unparalell'd event!Reaching from heaven to earth, Jehovah's armSnatch'd from the waves, and brings to me my son!Judge of the widow, and the orphan's father!Accept a widow's and a mother's thanksFor such a gift! What does my ANNA thinkOf the young eaglet of a valiant nest?How soon he gaz'd on bright and burning arms,Spurn'd the low dunghill where his fate had thrown him,And tower'd up to the region of his sire!ANNA.How fondly did your eyes devour the boy!Mysterious nature, with the unseen cordOf powerful instinct, drew you to your own.Lady RANDOLPH.The ready story of his birth believ'dSupprest my fancy quite; nor did he oweTo any likeness my so sudden favour:But now I long to see his face again,Examine every feature, and find outThe lineaments of DOUGLAS, or my own.But most of all, I long to let him knowWho his true parents are, to clasp his neck,And tell him all the story of his father.ANNA.With wary caution you must bear yourselfIn public, lest your tenderness break forth,And in observers stir conjectures strange.For, if a cherub in the shape of womanShould walk this world, yet defamation would,Like a vile cur, bark at the angel's train—To-day the baron started at your tears.Lady RANDOLPH.He did so, ANNA! well thy mistress knows,If the least circumstance, mote of offence,Should touch the baron's eye, his sight would beWith jealousy disorder'd. But the moreIt does behove me instant to declareThe birth of DOUGLAS, and assert his rights.This night I purpose with my son to meet,Reveal the secret and consult with him:For wise he is, or my fond judgment errs.As he does now, so look'd his noble father,Array'd in nature's ease: his mien, his speech,Were sweetly simple, and full oft deceiv'dThose trivial mortals who seem always wise.But, when the matter match'd his mighty mind,Uprose the Hero: on his piercing eyeSat Observation; on each glance of thoughtDecision follow'd, as the thunder-boltPursues the flash.ANNA.That demon haunts you still:Behold GLENALVON.Lady RANDOLPH.Now I shun him not.This day I brav'd him in behalf of NORVAL;Perhaps too far: at least my nicer fearsFor DOUGLAS thus interpret.Enter GLENALVON.GLENALVON.Noble dame!The hov'ring Dane at last his men hath landed:No band of pirates; but a mighty host,That come to settle where their valour conquers;To win a country, or to lose themselves.Lady RANDOLPH.But whence comes this intelligence, GLENALVON?GLENALVON.A nimble courier sent from yonder camp,To hasten up the chieftains of the north,Inform'd me, as he past, that the fierce DaneHad on the eastern coast of Lothian landed,Near to that place where the sea-rock immense,Amazing Bass looks o'er a fertile land.Lady RANDOLPH.Then must this western army march to joinThe warlike troops that guard Edena's tow'rs.GLENALVON.Beyond all question. If impairing timeHas not effac'd the image of a place,Once perfect in my breast, there is a wildWhich lyes to westward of that mighty rock,And seems by nature formed for the campOf water-wafted armies, whose chief strengthLies in firm foot, unflank'd with warlike horse:If martial skill directs the Danish lords,There inaccessible their army liesTo our swift scow'ring horse, the bloody fieldMust man to man, and foot to foot, be fought.Lady RANDOLPH.How many mothers shall bewail their sons!How many widows weep their husbands slain?Ye dames of Denmark! ev'n for you I feel,Who, sadly sitting on the sea-beat shore,Long look for lords that never shall return.GLENALVON.Oft has th'unconquer'd Caledonian swordWidow'd the north. The children of the slainCome, as I hope, to meet their fathers' fate.The monster war, with her infernal brood,Loud yelling fury, and life-ending pain,Are objects suited to GLENALVON's soul.Scorn is more grievous than the pains of death;Reproach, more piercing than the pointed sword.Lady RANDOLPH.I scorn thee not, but when I ought to scorn;Nor e'er reproach, but when insulted virtueAgainst audacious vice asserts herself.I own thy worth, GLENALVON; none more aptThan I to praise thine eminence in arms,And be the echo of thy martial fame.No longer vainly feed a guilty passion:Go and pursue a lawful mistress, glory.Upon the Danish crests redeem thy fault,And let thy valour be the shield of RANDOLPH.GLENALVON.One instant stay, and hear an alter'd man.When beauty pleads for virtue, vice abash'dFlies it's own colours, and goes o'er to virtue.I am your convert; time will shew how truely:Yet one immediate proof I mean to give.That youth for whom your ardent zeal to-day,Somewhat too haughtily, defy'd your slave,Amidst the shock of armies I'll defend,And turn death from him, with a guardian arm.Sedate by use, my bosom maddens notAt the tumultuous uproar of the field.Lady RANDOLPH.Act thus, GLENALVON, and I am thy friend:But that's thy least reward. Believe me, sir,The truly generous is the truely wise;And he who loves not others, lives unblest.Exit Lady RANDOLPH.GLENALVONsolus.Amen! and virtue is it's own reward! —I think that I have hit the very toneIn which she loves to speak. Honey'd assentHow pleasing art thou to the taste of man,And woman also! flattery directRarely disgusts. They little know mankindWho doubt it's operation: 'tis my key,And opes the wicket of the human heart.How far I have succeeded now I know not.Yet I incline to think her stormy virtueIs lull'd awhile: 'tis her alone I fear:Whilst she and RANDOLPH live, and live in faithAnd amity, uncertain is my tenure.Fate o'er my head suspends disgrace and death,By that weak hair, a peevish female's will.I am not idle: but the ebbs and flowsOf fortune's tide cannot be calculated.That slave of NORVAL's I have found most apt:I shew'd him gold, and he has pawn'd his soulTo say and swear whatever I suggest.NORVAL, I'm told, has that alluring look,'Twixt man and woman, which I have observ'dTo charm the nicer and fantastick dames,Who are, like lady RANDOLPH, full of virtue.In raising RANDOLPH's jealousy I mayBut point him to the truth. He seldom errsWho thinks the worst he can of womankind.The End of the THIRD ACT.ACT IV.SCENE I.Flourish of Trumpets.Enter Lord RANDOLPH attended.Lord RANDOLPH.SUmmon an hundred horse, by break of day,To wait our pleasure at the castle gate.Enter Lady RANDOLPH.Lady RANDOLPH.Alas! my lord! I've heard unwelcome News;The Danes are landed.Lord RANDOLPH.Ay, no inroad thisOf the Northumbrian bent to take a spoil:No sportive war, no tournament essay,Of some young knight resolv'd to break a spear,And stain with hostile blood his maiden arms.The Danes are landed: we must beat them back,Or live the slaves of Denmark.Lady RANDOLPH.Dreadful times!Lord RANDOLPH.The fenceless villages are all forsaken;The trembling mothers, and their children lodg'dIn well-girt towers and castles; whilst the menRetire indignant. Yet, like broken waves,They but retire more awful to return.Lady RANDOLPH.Immense, as fame reports, the Danish host!Lord RANDOLPH.Were it as numerous as loud fame reports,An army knit like ours wou'd pierce it thro':Brothers, that shrink not from each others side,And fond companions, fill our warlike files:For his dear offspring, and the wife he loves,The husband, and the fearless father arm.In vulgar breasts heroic ardor burns,And the poor peasant mates his daring lord.Lady RANDOLPH.Men's minds are temper'd, like their swords, for war;Lovers of danger, on destruction's brinkThey joy to rear erect their daring forms.Hence, early graves; hence the lone widow's life;And the sad mother's grief-embitter'd age.Where is our gallant guest?Lord RANDOLPH.Down in the valeI left him, managing a fiery steed,Whose stubbornness had foil'd the strength and skillOf every rider. But behold he comes,In earnest conversation with GLENALVON.Enter NORVAL and GLENALVON.GLENALVON! with the lark arise; go forth,And lead my troops that ly in yonder vale:Private I travel to the royal camp:NORVAL, thou goest with me. But say young man!Where didst thou learn so to discourse of war,And in such terms, as I o'erheard to day?War is no village science, nor it's phraseA language taught amongst the shepherd swains.NORVAL.Small is the skill my lord delights to praiseIn him he favours. — Hear from whence it came.Beneath a mountain's brow, the most remoteAnd inaccessible by shepherds trod,In a deep cave, dug by no mortal hand,A hermit liv'd; a melancholy man,Who was the wonder of our wand'ring swains.Austere and lonely, cruel to himself,Did they report him; the cold earth his bed,Water his drink, his food the shepherd's alms.I went to see him, and my heart was touch'dWith reverence and pity. Mild he spake,And, entring on discourse, such stories toldAs made me oft revisit his sad cell.For he had been a soldier in his youth;And fought in famous battles, when the peersOf Europe, by the bold GODFREDO led,Against th' usurping Infidel display'dThe cross of Christ, and won the Holy Land.Pleas'd with my admiration, and the fireHis speech struck from me, the old man wou'd shakeHis years away, and act his young encounters:Then, having shew'd his wounds, he'd sit him down,And all the live-long day discourse of war.To help my fancy, in the smooth green turfHe cut the figures of the marshall'd hosts;Describ'd the motions, and explain'd the useOf the deep column, and the lengthen'd line,The square, the crescent, and the phalanx firm.For all that Saracen, or Christian knewOf war's vast art, was to this hermit known.Lord RANDOLPH.Why did this soldier in a desart hideThose qualities, that shou'd have grac'd a camp?NORVAL.That too at last I learn'd. Unhappy man!Returning homewards by Messina's port,Loaded with wealth and honours bravely won,A rude and boist'rous captain of the seaFasten'd a quarrel on him. Fierce they fought:The stranger fell, and with his dying breathDeclar'd his name and lineage. Mighty God!The soldier cried, my brother! Oh! my brother!Lady RANDOLPH.His brother!NORVAL.Yes; of the same parents born;His only brother. They exchang'd forgiveness:And happy, in my mind, was he that died:For many deaths has the survivor suffer'd.In the wild desart on a rock he sits,Or on some nameless stream's untrodden banks,And ruminates all day his dreadful fate.At times, alas! not in his perfect mind!Holds dialogues with his lov'd brother's ghost;And oft each night forsakes his sullen couch,To make sad orisons for him he slew.Lady RANDOLPH.To what mysterious woes are mortals born!In this dire tragedy were there no moreUnhappy persons? did the parents live?NORVAL.No; they were dead: kind heav'n had clos'd their eyesBefore their son had shed his brother's blood.Lord RANDOLPH.Hard is his fate; for he was not to blame!There is a destiny in this strange world,Which oft decrees an undeserved doom:Let schoolmen tell us why.—From whence these sounds?[Trumpets at a distance.]Enter an OFFICER.OFFICER.My Lord, the trumpets of the troops of Lorn:Their valiant leader hails the noble RANDOLPH.Lord RANDOLPH.Mine ancient guest! does he the warriors lead?Has Denmark rous'd the brave old knight to arms?OFFICER.No; worn with warfare, he resigns the sword.His eldest hope, the vallant John of Lorn,Now leads his kindred bands.Lord RANDOLPH.GLENALVON, go.With hospitality's most strong requestEntreat the chief.[Exit GLENALVON.]OFFICER.My lord, requests are vain.He urges on, impatient of delay,Stung with the tidings of the foe's approach.Lord RANDOLPH.May victory sit on the warriour's plume!Bravest of men! his flocks and herds are safe;Remote from wars alarms his pastures lye,By mountains inaccessible secur'd:Yet foremost he into the plain descends,Eager to bleed in battles not his own.Such were the heroes of the ancient world:Contemners they of indolence and gain;But still for love of glory, and of arms,Prone to encounter peril, and to liftAgainst each strong antagonist the spear.I'll go and press the hero to my breast.[Exit RANDOLPH.]Manet Lady RANDOLPH and NORVAL.Lady RANDOLPH.The soldier's loftiness, the pride and pompInvesting awful war, NORVAL, I see,Transport thy youthful mind.NORVAL.Ah! should they not?Blest be the hour I left my father's house!I might have been a shepherd all my days,And stole obscurely to a peasant's grave.Now, if I live, with mighty chiefs I stand;And, if I fall, with noble dust I lye.Lady RANDOLPH.There is a gen'rous spirit in thy breast,That could have well sustain'd a prouder fortune.This way with me; under yon spreading beech,Unseen, unheard, by human eye or ear,I will amaze thee with a wond'rous tale.NORVAL.Let there be danger lady with the secret,That I may hug it to my grateful heart,And prove my faith. Command my sword, my life:These are the sole possessions of poor NORVAL.Lady RANDOLPH.Know'st thou these gems?NORVAL.Durst I believe mine eyesI'd say I knew them, and they were my father's.Lady RANDOLPH.Thy father's say'st thou! ah! they were thy father's!NORVAL.I saw them once, and curiously enquir'dOf both my parents whence such splendor came?But I was check'd, and more could never learn.Lady RANDOLPH.Then learn of me, thou art not NORVAL's son.NORVAL.Not NORVAL's son!Lady RANDOLPH.Nor of a shepherd sprung.NORVAL.Lady, who am I then?Lady RANDOLPH.Noble thou art;For noble was thy sire!NORVAL.I will believe—O! tell me farther! Say who was my father?Lady RANDOLPH.DOUGLAS!NORVAL.Lord DOUGLAS, whom to day I saw?Lady RANDOLPH.His younger brother.NORVAL.And in yonder camp?Lady RANDOLPH.Alas!NORVAL.You make me tremble — Sighs and tears!Lives my brave father?Lady RANDOLPH.Ah! too brave indeed!He fell in battle e're thyself was born.NORVAL.Ah me unhappy! e're I saw the light?But does my mother live? I may conclude,From my own fate, her portion has been sorrow.Lady RANDOLPH.She lives; but wastes her life in constant woe,Weeping her husband slain, her infant lost.NORVAL.You that are skill'd so well in the sad storyOf my unhappy parents, and with tearsBewail their destiny, now have compassionUpon the offspring of the friends you lov'd.O! tell me who, and where my mother is!Opprest by a base world, perhaps she bendsBeneath the weight of other ills than grief;And desolate, implores of heav'n, the aidHer son should give. It is, it must be so —Your countenance confesses that she's wretched.O! tell me her condition! Can the sword —Who shall resist me in a parent's cause?Lady RANDOLPH.Thy virtue ends her woe. — My son, my son!I am thy mother, and the wife of DOUGLAS!Falls upon his neck.NORVAL.O heav'n and earth, how wond'rous is my fate!Art thou my mother? Ever let me kneel!Lady RANDOLPH.Image of DOUGLAS! Fruit of fatal love!All that I owe thy sire I pay to thee.NORVAL.Respect and admiration still possess me,Checking the love and fondness of a son.Yet I was filial to my humble parents.But did my sire surpass the rest of men,As thou excellest all of womankind?Lady RANDOLPH.Arise, my son! In me thou dost beholdThe poor remains of beauty once admir'd:The autumn of my days is come already;For sorrow made my summer haste away.Yet in my prime I equal'd not thy father:His eyes were like the eagle's, yet sometimesLiker the dove's; and, as he pleas'd, he wonAll hearts with softness, or with spirit aw'd.NORVAL.How did he fall? Sure 'twas a bloody fieldWhen DOUGLAS died. O I have much to ask!Lady RANDOLPH.Hereafter thou shalt hear the lengthen'd taleOf all thy father's and thy mother's woes.At present this: Thou art the rightful heirOf yonder castle, and the wide domainsWhich now Lord RANDOLPH, as my husband, holds.But thou shalt not be wrong'd; I have the powerTo right thee still: Before the king I'll kneel,And call Lord DOUGLAS to protect his blood.NORVAL.The blood of DOUGLAS will protect itself.Lady RANDOLPH.But we shall need both friends and favour, boy,To wrest thy lands and lordship from the gripeOf RANDOLPH and his kinsman. Yet I thinkMy tale will move each gentle heart to pity,My life incline the virtuous to believe.NORVAL.To be the son of DOUGLAS is to meInheritance enough. Declare my birth,And in the field I'll seek for same and fortune.Lady RANDOLPH.Thou dost not know what perils and injusticeAwait the poor man's valour. O! my son!The noblest blood in all the land's abash'd,Having no lacquey but pale poverty.Too long hast thou been thus attended, DOUGLAS!Too long hast thou been deem'd a peasant's child.The wanton heir of some inglorious chiefPerhaps has scorn'd thee, in the youthful sports;Whilst thy indignant spirit swell'd in vain!Such contumely thou no more shalt bear:But how I purpose to redress thy wrongsMust be hereafter told. Prudence directsThat we should part before yon chiefs return.Retire, and from thy rustick follower's handReceive a billet, which thy mother's care,Anxious to see thee, dictated beforeThis casual opportunity aroseOf private conference. It's purport mark;For as I there appoint we meet again.Leave me, my son! and frame thy manners stillTo NORVAL's, not to noble DOUGLAS' state.NORVAL.I will remember. Where is NORVAL now?That good old man.Lady RANDOLPH.At hand conceal'd he lies,An useful witness. But beware, my son,Of yon GLENALVON; in his guilty breastResides a villain's shrewdness, ever proneTo false conjecture. He hath griev'd my heart.NARVOL.Has he indeed? Then let yon false GLENALVONBeware of me.Exit DOUGLAS.Manet Lady RANDOLPH.There burst the smother'd flame!O! thou all righteous and eternal King!Who father of the fatherless art call'd,Protect my son! — Thy inspiration, Lord!Hath fill'd his bosom with that sacred fire,Which in the breasts of his forefathers burn'd:Set him on high like them, that he may shineThe star and glory of his native land!Then let the minister of death descend,And bear my willing spirit to it's place.Yonder they come. How do bad women findUnchanging aspects to conceal their guilt?When I by reason, and by justice urg'd,Full hardly can dissemble with these menIn nature's pious cause.Enter Lord RANDOLPH and GLENALVON.Lord RANDOLPH.Yon gallant chief,Of arms enamour'd, all repose disclaims.Lady RANDOLPH.Be not, my Lord, by his example sway'd:Arrange the business of to-morrow now,And, when you enter, speak of war no more.Exit Lady RANDOLPH.Manent Lord RANDOLPH and GLENALVON.Lord RANDOLPH.'Tis so by heav'n! her mien, her voice, her eye,And her impatience to be gone, confirm it.GLENALVON.He parted from her now: Behind the mount,Amongst the trees, I saw him glide along.Lord RANDOLPH.For sad, sequester'd virtue she's renown'd!GLENALVON.Most true, my Lord.Lord RANDOLPH.Yet this distinguish'd dameInvites a youth, the acquaintance of a day,Alone to meet her at the midnight hour.This assignation,
(shews a letter)
the assassin freed,Her manifest affection for the youth,Might breed suspicion in a husband's brain,Whose gentle consort all for love had wedded:Much more in mine. MATILDA never lov'd me.Let no man, after me, a woman wed,Whose heart he knows he has not; tho' she bringsA mine of gold, a kingdom for her dowry,For let her seem, like the night's shadowy queen,Cold and contemplative; — He cannot trust her:She may, she will, bring shame and sorrow on him;The worst of sorrow, and the worst of shames!GLENALVON.Yield not, my Lord, to such afflicting thoughts;But let the spirit of an husband sleep,'Till your own senses make a sure conclusion.This billet must to blooming NORVAL go:At the next turn awaits my trusty spy;I'll give it him refitted for his master.In the close thicket take your secret stand;The moon shines bright, and your own eyes may judgeOf their behaviour.Lord RANDOLPH.Thou dost counsel well.GLENALVON.Permit me now to make one slight essay.Of all the trophies which vain mortal's boast,By wit, by valour, or by wisdom won,The first and fairest, in a young mans eye,Is woman's captive heart. Successful loveWith glorious fumes intoxicates the mind;And the proud conqueror in triumph movesAir-born, exalted above vulgar men.Lord RANDOLPH.And what avails this maxim?GLENALVON.Much, my lord!Withdraw a little: I'll accost young NORVAL,And with ironical derisive counselExplore his spirit. If he is no moreThan humble NORVAL, by thy favour rais'd,Brave as he is, he'll shrink astonish'd from me:But if he be the favourite of the fair,Lov'd by the first of Caledonia's dames,He'll turn upon me, as the lion turnsUpon the hunter's spear.Lord RANDOLPH.'Tis shrewdly thought.GLENALVON.When we grow loud, draw near. But let my LordHis rising wrath restrain.Exit RANDOLPH.Manet GLENALVON.'Tis strange by heav'n!That she should run full tilt her fond career,To one so little known. She too that seem'dPure as the winter stream, when ice emboss'dWhitens it's course. Even I did think her chaste,Whose charity exceeds not. Precious sex!Whose deeds lascivious pass GLENALVON's thoughts!NORVAL appears.His port I love; he's in a proper moodTo chide the thunder, if at him it roar'd.Has NORVAL seen the troops?NORVAL.The setting sun,With yellow radiance lighten'd all the vale,And as the warriours mov'd, each polish'd helm,Corslet, or spear, glanc'd back his gilded beams.The hill they climb'd, and halting at it's top,Of more than mortal size, tow'ring, they seem'd,An host angelic, clad in burning arms.GLENALVON.Thou talk'st it well; no leader of our host,In sounds more lofty, speaks of glorious war.NORVAL.If I shall e'er acquire a leader's name,My speech will be less ardent. NoveltyNow prompts my tongue, and youthful admirationVents itself freely; since no part is mineOf praise, pertaining to the great in arms.GLENALVON.You wrong yourself, brave sir; your martial deedsHave rank'd you with the great: but mark me NORVAL;Lord RANDOLPH's favour now exalts your youthAbove his veterans of famous service.Let me, who know these soldiers, counsel you.Give them all honour; seem not to command;Else they will scarcely brook your late sprung power,Which nor alliance props, nor birth adorns.NORVAL.Sir, I have been accustom'd all my daysTo hear and speak the plain and simple truth:And tho' I have been told, that there are menWho borrow friendship's tongue to speak their scorn,Yet in such language I am little skill'd.Therefore I thank GLENALVON for his counsel,Altho' it sounded harshly. Why remindMe of my birth obscure? Why slur my powerWith such contemptuous terms?GLENALVON.I did not meanTo gall your pride, which now I see is great.NORVAL.My pride!GLENALVON.Suppress it as you wish to prosper.Your pride's excessive. Yet for RANDOLPH's sakeI will not leave you to it's rash direction.If thus you swell, and frown at high-born men,Will high-born men endure a shepherd's scorn?NORVAL.A shepherd's scorn!GLENALVON.Yes; if you presumeTo bend on soldiers these disdainful eyes,As if you took the measure of their minds,And said in secret, you're no match for me;What will become of you?NORVAL.If this were told! —
AsideHast thou no fears for thy presumptuous self!GLENALVON.Ha! Dost thou threaten me?NORVAL.Didst thou not hear?GLENALVON.Unwillingly I did; a nobler foeHad not been question'd thus. But such as thee—NORVAL.Whom dost thou think me?GLENALVON.Norval.NORVAL.So I am —And who is NORVAL in GLENALVON's eyes?GLENALVON.A peasant's son, a wandering beggar-boy;At best no more, even if he speaks the truth.NORVAL.False as thou art, dost thou suspect my truth?GLENALVON.Thy truth! thou'rt all a lye; and false as hellIs the vain-glorious tale thou told'st to RANDOLPH.NORVAL.If I were chain'd, unarm'd, and bedrid old,Perhaps I should revile: But as I amI have no tongue to rail. The humble NORVALIs of a race, who strive not but with deeds.Did I not fear to freeze thy shallow valour,And make thee sink too soon beneath my sword,I'd tell thee—what thou art. I know thee well.GLENALVON.Dost thou not know GLENALVON, born to commandTen thousand slaves like thee?NORVAL.Villain, no more:Draw and defend thy life. I did designTo have defy'd thee in another cause:But heaven accelerates it's vengeance on thee.Now for my own and Lady RANDOLPH's wrongs.Enter Lord RANDOLPH.Lord RANDOLPH.Hold, I command you both. The man that stirsMakes me his foe.NORVAL.Another voice than thineThat threat had vainly sounded, noble RANDOLPH.GLENALVON.Hear him, my lord; he's wond'rous condescending!Mark the humility of shepherd NORVAL!NORVAL.Now you may scoff in safety.(Sheaths his sword.)Lord RANDOLPH.Speak not thus,Taunting each other; but unfold to meThe cause of quarrel, then I judge betwixt you.NORVAL.Nay, my good lord, tho' I revere you much,My cause I plead not, nor demand your judgment.I blush to speak; I will not, cannot speakTh' opprobrious words that I from him have borne.To the liege-lord of my dear native landI owe a subject's homage: but ev'n himAnd his high arbitration I'd reject.Within my bosom reigns another lord;Honour, sole judge and umpire of itself.If my free speech offend you, noble RANDOLPH,Revoke your favours, and let NORVAL goHence as he came, alone, but not dishonour'd.Lord RANDOLPH.Thus far I'll mediate with impartial voice:The ancient foe of Caledonia's landNow waves his banners o'er her frighted fields.Suspend your purpose, 'till your country's armsRepel the bold invader: then decide,The private quarrel.GLENALVON.I agree to this.NORVAL.And I.Enter SERVANT.SERVANT.The banquet waits.Lord RANDOLPH.We come.Exit RANDOLPH.GLENALVON.Norval,Let not our variance mar the social hour,Nor wrong the hospitality of RANDOLPH.Nor frowning anger, nor yet wrinkl'd hate,Shall stain my countenance. Smooth thou thy brow;Nor let our strife disturb the gentle dame.NORVAL.Think not so lightly, Sir, of my resentment:When we contend again, our strife is mortal.End of the FOURTH ACT.ACT V.SCENE I.The Wood.Enter DOUGLAS.THIS is the place the centre of the grove.Here stands the oak, the monarch of the wood.How sweet and solemn is this mid-night scene!The silver moon, unclouded, holds her wayThro' skies where I could count each little star.The fanning west wind scarcely stirs the leaves;The river, rushing o'er its pebbled bed,Imposes silence with a stilly sound.In such a place as this at such an hour,If ancestry can be in ought believ'd,Descending spirits have convers'd with man,And told the secrets of the world unknown.Enter Old NORVAL.Old NORVAL.'Tis he. But what if he should chide me hence?His just reproach I fear.DOUGLAS turns and sees him.Forgive, forgive,Can'st thou forgive the man, the selfish man,Who bred Sir MALCOLM's heir a shepherd's son.DOUGLAS.Kneel not to me: thou art my father still:Thy wish'd-for presence now compleats my joy.Welcome to me, my fortunes thou shalt share,And ever honour'd with thy DOUGLAS live.Old NORVAL.And do'st thou call me father? O my son!I think that I could die to make amendsFor the great wrong I did thee. 'Twas my crimeWhich in the wilderness so long conceal'dThe blossom of thy youth.DOUGLAS.Not worse the fruit,That in the wilderness the blossom blow'd.Amongst the shepherds, in the humble cote,I learn'd some lessons, which I'll not forgetWhen I inhabit yonder lofty towers.I, who was once a swain, will ever proveThe poor man's friend; and, when my vassals bow.NORVAL shall smooth the crested pride of DOUGLAS.NORVAL.Let me but live to see thine exaltation!Yet grievous are my fears. O leave this place,And those unfriendly towers.DOUGLAS.Why should I leave them?NORVAL.Lord RANDOLPH and his kinsman seek your life.DOUGLAS.How know'st thou that?NORVAL.I will inform you how.When evening came, I left the secret placeAppointed for me by your mother's care,And fondly trod in each accustom'd pathThat to the castle leads. Whilst thus I rang'd,I was alarm'd with unexpected soundsOf earnest voices. On the persons came:Unseen I lurk'd, and overheard them nameEach other as they talk'd, lord RANDOLPH this,And that GLENALVON: still of you they spoke,And of the lady: threatning was their speech,Tho' but imperfectly my ear could hear it.'Twas strange, they said, a wonderful discov'ry;And ever and anon they vow'd revenge.DOUGLAS.Revenge! for what?NORVAL.For being what you are;Sir MALCOLM's heir: how else have you offended?When they were gone, I hied me to my cottage,And there sat musing how I best might findMeans to inform you of their wicked purpose.But I could think of none: at last perplex'dI issued forth, encompassing the towerWith many a weary step and wishful look.Now providence hath brought you to my sight,Let not your too couragious spirit scornThe caution which I give.DOUGLAS.I scorn it not.My mother warn'd me of GLENALVON's baseness:But I will not suspect the noble RANDOLPH.In our encounter with the vile assassins,In mark'd his brave demeanor: him I'll trust.NORVAL.I fear you will too far.DOUGLAS.Here in this placeI wait my mother's coming: she shall knowWhat thou hast told: her counsel I will follow:And cautious ever are a mother's counsels.You must depart; your presence may preventOur interview.NORVAL.My blessing rest upon thee!O may heav'n's hand, which sav'd thee from the wave,And from the sword of foes, be near thee still;Turning mischance, if ought hangs o'er thy head,All upon mine!Exit Old NORVAL.DOUGLAS.He loves me like a parent;And must not, shall not lose the son he loves,Altho' his son has found a nobler father.Eventful day▪ how hast thou chang'd my state!Once on the cold, and winter shaded sideOf a bleak hill, mischance had rooted me,Never to thrive, child of another soil:Transplanted now to the gay sunny vale,Like the green thorn of May my fortune flowers.Ye glorious stars! high heav'n's resplendent host!To whom I oft have of my lot complain'd,Hear and record my soul's unalter'd wish!Dead or alive, let me but be renown'd!May heav'n inspire some fierce gigantic Dane,To give a bold defiance to our host!Before he speaks it out I will accept;Like DOUGLAS conquer, or like DOUGLAS die.Enter Lady RANDOLPH.Lady RANDOLPH.My son! I heard a voice—DOUGLAS.—The voice was mine.Lady RANDOLPH.Didst thou complain aloud to nature's ear,That thus in dusky shades, at mid-night hours,By stealth the mother and the son should meet?Embracing him.DOUGLAS.No; on this happy day, this better birth-day,My thoughts and words are all of hope and joy.Lady RANDOLPH.Sad fear and melancholy still divideThe empire of my breast with hope and joy.Now hear what I advise.DOUGLAS.First, let me tellWhat may the tenor of your counsel change.Lady RANDOLPH.My heart forebodes some evil!DOUGLAS.'Tis not good. —At eve, unseen by RANDOLPH and GLENALVON,The good old NORVAL in the grove o'er heardTheir conversation: oft they mention'd meWith dreadful threatnings; you they sometimes nam'd'Twas strange, they said, a wonderful discov'ry;And ever and anon they vow'd revenge.Lady RANDOLPH.Defend us gracious God! we are betray'd:They have found out the secret of thy birth;It must be so. That is the great discovery.Sir MALCOLM's heir is come to claim his own;And they will be reveng'd. Perhaps even now,Arm'd and prepar'd for murder, they but waitA darker and more silent hour, to break,Into the chamber where they think thou sleep'st.This moment, this, heav'n hath ordain'd to save thee!Fly to the camp, my son!DOUGLAS.And leave you here?No: to the castle let us go together,Call up the ancient servants of your house,Who in their youth did eat your father's bread.Then tell them loudly that I am your son.If in the breasts of men one spark remainsOf sacred love, fidelity, or pity,Some in your cause will arm. I ask but fewTo drive those spoilers from my father's house.Lady RANDOLPH.O nature, nature! what can check thy force?Thou genuine offspring of the daring DOUGLAS!But rush not on destruction: save thyself,And I am safe. To me they mean no harm.Thy stay but risks thy precious life in vain.That winding path conducts thee to the river.Cross where thou seest a broad and beaten way,Which running eastward leads thee to the camp.Instant demand admittance to Lord DOUGLAS.Shew him these jewels, which his brother wore.Thy look, thy voice, will make him feel the truth,Which I by certain proof will soon confirm.DOUGLAS.I yield me and obey: but yet my heartBleeds at this parting. Something bids me stayAnd guard a mother's life. Oft have I readOf wond'rous deeds by one bold arm atchiev'd.Our foes are two; no more: let me go forth,And see if any shield can guard GLENALVON.Lady RANDOLPH.If thou regard'st thy mother, or rever'stThy father's mem'ry, think of this no more.One thing I have to say before we part:Long wert thou lost; and thou art found, my child,In a most fearful season. War and battlehave great cause to dread. Too well I seeWhich way the current of thy temper sets:To day I've found thee. Oh! my long lost hope!If thou to giddy valour giv'st the rein,To morrow I may lose my son for ever.The love of thee, before thou saw'st the light,Sustain'd my life when thy brave father fell.If thou shalt fall, I have nor love nor hopeIn this waste world! my son, remember me!DOUGLAS.What shall I say? how can I give you comfort?The God of battles of my life disposeAs may be best for you! for whose dear sakeI will not bear myself as I resolv'd.But yet consider, as no vulgar nameThat which I boast sounds amongst martial men.How will inglorious caution suit my claim?The post of fate unshrinking I maintain.My country's foes must witness who I am.On the invaders heads I'll prove my birth,'Till friends and foes confess the genuine strain.If in this strife I fall, blame not your son,Who if he lives not honour'd, must not live.Lady RANDOLPH.I will not utter what my bosom feels.Too well I love that valour which I warn.Farewell, my son! my counsels are but vain.Embracing.And as high heaven hath will'd it all must be.
separate.Lady RANDOLPH.Gaze not on me, thou wilt mistake the path;I'll point it out again.[Just as they are separating, enter from the wood Lord RANDOLPH and GLENALVON.]Lord RANDOLPH.Not in her presence.Now —GLENALVON.I'm prepar'd.Lord RANDOLPH.No: I command thee stay.I go alone: it never shall be saidThat I took odds to combat mortal man.The noblest vengeance is the most compleat.[Exit Lord RANDOLPH.][GLENALVON makes some steps to the same side of the stage, listens and speaks.]GLENALVON.Demons of death come settle on my sword,And to a double slaughter guide it home!The lover and the husband both must die.[Lord RANDOLPH behind the scenes.]Lord RANDOLPH.Draw, Villain! draw.DOUGLAS.Assail me not Lord, RANDOLPH;Not as thou lov'st thy self.[Clashing of swords.][GLENALVON running out.]Now is the time.Enter Lady RANDOLPH at the opposite side of the stage, faint and breathless.Lady RANDOLPH.Lord RANDOLPH hear me; all shall be thine own:But spare! Oh spare my son!Enter DOUGLAS with a sword in each hand.My mother's voice!I can protect thee still.Lady RANDOLPH.He lives, he lives:For this, for this to heaven eternal praise!But sure I saw thee fall.DOUGLAS.It was GLENALVON.Just as my arm had master'd RANDOLPH's sword,The villain came behind me; but I flew him.Lady RANDOLPH.Behind thee! Ah; thou'rt wounded! O my child,How pale thou look'st! and shall I lose thee now?DOUGLAS.Do not despair: I feel a little faintness;I hope it will not last.[Leans upon his sword.]Lady RANDOLPH.There is no hope!And we must part! the hand of death is on thee!O my beloved child! O DOUGLAS, DOUGLAS![DOUGLAS growing more and more faint.]DOUGLAS.Too soon we part: I have not long been DOUGLAS.O destiny! hardly thou dealst with me:Clouded and hid, a stranger to myself,In low and poor obscurity I liv'd.Lady RANDOLPH.Has heav'n preserv'd thee for an end like this?DOUGLAS.O had I fallen as my brave fathers fell,Turning with fatal arm the tide of battle!Like them I should have smil'd and welcom'd death.But thus to perish by a villain's hand!Cut off from nature's and from glory's course,Which never mortal was so fond to run.Lady RANDOLPH.Hear justice! hear! are these the fruits of virtue?[DOUGLAS falls.]DOUGLAS.Unknown I die; no tongue shall speak of me. —Some noble spirits, judging by themselves,May yet conjecture what I might have prov'd,And think life only wanting to my fame:But who shall comfort thee?Lady RANDOLPH.Despair! despair!DOUGLAS.O had it pleas'd high heaven to let me liveA little while! — my eyes that gaze on theeGrow dim apace! my mother —
[Dies.]Enter Lord RANDOLPH and ANNA.Lord RANDOLPH.Thy words, the words of truth, have pierc'd my heart.I am the stain of knighthood and of arms.Oh! if my brave deliverer survivesThe traitor's sword —ANNA.Alas! look there, my lord.Lord RANDOLPH.The mother and her son! How curst I am!Was I the cause? No: I was not the cause.Yon matchless villain did seduce my soulTo frantic jealousy.ANNA.My lady lives:The agony of grief hath but supprestAwhile her powers.Lord RANDOLPH.But my deliverer's dead!The world did once esteem Lord RANDOLPH well.Sincere of heart, for spotless honour fam'd:And, in my early days, glory I gain'dBeneath the holy banner of the cross.Now past the noon of life, shame comes upon me;Reproach, and infamy, and public hate,Are near at hand: for all mankind will thinkThat RANDOLPH basely stab'd Sir MALCOLM's heir.Lady RANDOLPH recovering.Lady RANDOLPH.Where am I now? still in this wretched world!Grief cannot break a heart so hard as mine.My youth was worn in anguish: but youth's strength,With hope's assistance, bore the brunt of sorrow;And train'd me on to be the object now,On which omnipotence displays itself,Making a spectacle, a tale of me,To awe it's vassal, man.Lord RANDOLPH.O misery!Amidst thy raging grief I must proclaimMy innocence.Lady RANDOLPH.Thy innocence!Lord RANDOLPH.My guiltIs innocence, compared with what thou think'st it.Lady RANDOLPH.Of thee I think not: what have I to doWith thee, or any thing? My son! my son!My beautiful! my brave! how proud was IOf thee, and of thy valour! My fond heartO'erflow'd this day with transport, when I thoughtOf growing old amidst a race of thine,Who might make up to me their father's childhood,And bear my brother's and my husband's name:Now all my hopes are dead! A little whileWas I a wife! a mother not so long!What am I now? — I know. — But I shall beThat only whilst I please; for such a sonAnd such a husband make a woman bold.Runs out.Lord RANDOLPH.Follow her, ANNA: I myself would follow,But in this rage she must abhor my presence.Exit ANNA.Enter Old NORVAL.NORVAL.I heard the voice of woe; heaven guard my child!Lord RANDOLPH.Already is the idle gaping croud,The spiteful vulgar, come to gaze on RANDOLPH.Begone.NORVAL.I fear thee not. I will not go.Here I'll remain. I'm an accomplice, Lord,With thee in murder. Yes, my sins did helpTo crush down to the ground this lovely plant.O noblest youth that ever yet was born!Sweetest and best, gentlest and bravest spirit,That ever bless'd the world! Wretch that I am,Who saw that noble spirit swell and riseAbove the narrow limits that confin'd it!Yet never was by all thy virtues wonTo do thee justice, and reveal the secret,Which timely known, had rais'd thee far aboveThe villain's snare. Oh! I am punish'd now!These are the hairs that should have strew'd the ground,And not the locks of DOUGLAS.Tears his hair, and throws himself upon the ground.Lord RANDOLPH.I know thee now: thy boldness I forgive:My crest is fallen. For thee I will appointA place of rest, if grief will let thee rest.I will reward, altho' I cannot punish.Curst, curst GLENALVON, he escap'd too well,Tho' slain and baffled by the hand he hated.Foaming with rage and fury to the last,Cursing his conqueror, the felon dy'd.Enter ANNA.ANNA.My Lord, my Lord!Lord RANDOLPH.Speak: I can hear of horror.ANNA.Horror indeed!Lord RANDOLPH.MATILDA?ANNA.Is no more:She ran, she flew like light'ning up the hill,Nor halted till the precipice she gain'd,Beneath whose low'ring top the river fallsIngulph'd in rifted rocks: thither she came,As fearless as the eagle lights upon it,And headlong down. —Lord RANDOLPH.'Twas I! alas! 'twas IThat fill'd her breast with fury; drove her downThe precipice of death! Wretch that I am!ANNA.O had you seen her last despairing look!Upon the brink she stood, and cast her eyesDown on the deep: then lifting up her headAnd her white hands to heaven, seeming to say,Why am I forc'd to this? She plung'd herselfInto the empty air.Lord RANDOLPH.I will not vent,In vain complaints, the passion of my soul.Peace in this world I never can enjoy.These wounds the gratitude of RANDOLPH gave.They speak aloud, and with the voice of fateDenounce my doom. I am resolv'd. I'll goStraight to the battle, where the man that makesMe turn aside must threaten worse than death.Thou, faithful to thy mistress, take this ring,Full warrant of my power. Let every riteWith cost and pomp upon their funerals wait:For RANDOLPH hopes he never shall return.FINIS.EPILOGUE.Spoken by Mr. BARRY.AN Epilogue I ask'd; but not one wordOur bard will write. He vows 'tis most absurdWith comick wit to contradict the strainOf tragedy, and make your sorrows vain.Sadly he says, that pity is the best,And noblest passion of the human breast:For when its sacred streams the heart o'er-flow,In gushes pleasure with the tide of woe;And when its waves retire, like those of Nile,They leave behind them such a golden soil,That there the virtues without culture grow,There the sweet blossoms of affection blow.These were his words; void of delusive artI felt them; for he spoke them from his heart.Nor will I now attempt, with witty folly,To chace away celestial melancholy.
