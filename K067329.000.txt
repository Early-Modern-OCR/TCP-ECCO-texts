Loyalty and Friendship.By I. WATTS.—Si non Uranie lyramCoelestem cohibet, nec PolyhymniaHumanum resugit tendere barbiton.Horat. Od. 1. Imitat.Pythag. Aur. Carm.LONDON,
Printed by S. and D. Bridge, for John Lawrence at
the Sign of the Angel in the Poultrey. MDCCVI.PREFACE.IT has been a long Complaint of the Vertuous
and Refined World, that Poesie whose Original
is Divine, should be enslav'd to Vice and Profaneness;
that an Art inspired from Heaven should have
so far lost the Memory of its Birth-place, as to be ingaged
in the Interests of Hell: and bring all her resistless
Forces of Metaphor, Wit, Rhyme and Number,
and range them under the Banner of the Great
Malicious Spirit to assault the Honour of God and
the Souls of Men.The Eldest Song which History has brought down
to our Ears was a noble Act of Worship paid to the
God of Israel,When his Right hand became glorious
in Power, when thy Right hand, O Lord,
dashed in pieces the Enemy; the Chariots of Pharaoh
and his Host were cast into the Red-Sea; Thou didst
blow with thy Wind, the Deep covered them, and
they sank as Lead in the mighty Waters, Exod. 15.
This Art was maintain'd Sacred thro' the following
Ages of the Church, and imploy'd by Kings and Prophets,
by David, Solomon, and Isaiah, in breathing
the Life of Angels into the Hearts of Men, and rearing
their Minds Heavenward in warm and tuneful
Devotion.
In the Younger Days of Heathenism the Muses
were devoted to the same Service: The Language in
which Old Hesiod addresses them is this.,In English.
Pierian Muses, fam'd for Heavenly Lays,Descend, and sing the God your Fathers Praise.And the pursues the Subject in ten Pious Lines, which
I could not forbear to Transcribe if the Aspect and
Sound of so much Greek were not terrifying to a nice
Reader.But some of the later Poets of the Pagan World
have more debased this Divine Gift, and many of
the Writers of first Rank in this our Age of National
Christians have to their Eternal Shame surpassed
the vilest of the Gentiles. They have Expos'd
Religion to Drollery, and drest her up in the most
Ridiculous Habit, for the Scorn of the ruder Herd
of Mankind. They have painted the Vices like so
many Goddesses, added the Charms of Wit to Debauchery,
and heightned the Temptation where Nature
needs the strongest Restraints. With Sweetness of
Sound and Delicacy of Expression they have given a
Relish to Blasphemies of the harshest kind, and when
they rant at their Maker in Sonorous Numbers they
fancy themselves to have acted the Hero well.
Thus almost in vain have the Throne and the Pulpit
cried, Reformation, while the Stage and Licentious
Poems have waged open War with the Pious
Design of Church and State. The Press has spread
the Poyson far, and scatter'd wide the Mortal Infection;
Unthinking Youth have been allured to Sin beyond
the Vicious Propensities of Nature, plung'd
early into Diseases and Death, and sunk down to
Damnation in Multitudes. How will these Allies of
the Nether World, the Lewd and Profane Versifiers
stand aghast before the Great Judge, when the Blood
of many Souls whom they never saw shall be laid to
the Charge of their Writings, and be dreadfully requir'd
at their Hands. The Reverend Mr. Collier
has set this Awful Scene before them in just and flaming
Colours; and if the Application were not too
rude and uncivil, that noble Stanza of my Lord Roscommon
on Psal. 148. might be address'd to them,
Ye Dragons, whose Contagious BreathPeoples the dark Retreats of Death,Change your dire Hissings into Heav'nly Songs,And praise your Maker with your Forked Tongues.But alass! there is a deep Silence among these
Men of all Divine Subjects, unless in Banter; The
Wonders of Creating Power, the Mysteries of Redeeming
Love, and the mighty Works of Renewing
Grace are neglected by those, whom Heaven has indued
with a Gift proper to adorn and cultivate 'em:
An Art whose sweet Insinuations might have almost

convey'd Piety into resisting Nature, and melted
Souls of Iron to the Love of Virtue.Will the Writers of this Age cite the French Critic
on their side, and say,
De la Foy d'un Chrétien les Mysteres terriblesD'Ornemens egayez ne sont point susceptibles:
That the Mysteries of Christianity are not capable of
 Ornaments: The Davideis and the two Arthurs broke down this Obstacle, and experimentally
futed the vain pretence.Besides, the Christian Mysteries have no need of
these Tinsel Trappings; the Glories of our Religion
in a plain Narration and a simple Dress have something
brighter and bolder in them, something more
surprizing and Divine, than all the Adventures of
Gods and Heroes, all the dazling Images of false lustre
that compose and garnish a Heathen Poem; here
the Subjects themselves would give wonderful Aids
to the Muse; and the Heavenly Theme would so
relieve a dull Hour and a languishing Genius, that
when the Muse nods, the Sense would burn and
sparkle upon the Reader, and keep him feelingly
awake.With how much less toil and expence might a
Dryden, an Otway, a Congreve, or a Dennis furnish
out a Christian Poem than a Modern Play; there is
nothing amongst all the Ancient Fables or Later
Romances, that have two such Extremes united in
them, as the Eternal God becoming an Infant of
Days, the Possessor of the Pallace of Heaven laid to

Sleep in a Manger, the Holy Jesus who knew no
Sin bearing the Sins of Men in his Body on the
Tree, Agonies of Sorrow loading the Soul of him
who was God over all Blessed for ever; and the Soveraign
of Life stretching his Arms on a Cross,
Bleeding and Expiring: The Heaven and the Hell
in our Divinity are infinitely more delightful and
dreadful than the Childish Figments of a Dog with
three Heads, the Buckets of the Belides, the Furies
with Snaky Hairs, or all the Flow'ry Stories of Elysium.
Aud if we survey the one as Themes Divinely
True, and the other as a Medly of Fooleries which
we can never believe, the advantage for touching the
Springs of Passion will fall infinitely on the side of
the Christian Poet; our Wonder and our Love, our
Pity, Delight, and Sorrow, with the long train of
Hopes and Fears, must needs be under the Command
of an Harmonious Pen, whose every Line makes a
part of the Reader's Faith, and is the very Life or
Death of his Soul.If the trifling and incredible Tales that furnish out
a Tragedy are so arm'd by Wit and Fancy as to become
Soveraign of the Rational Powers, to triumph
over all the Affections, and manage our Smiles and
our Tears at pleasure; how wondrous a Conquest
might be obtain'd over a wild World, and reduce it
at least to Sobriety, if the same Happy Talent were
employed in dressing the Scenes of Religion in their
proper Figures of Majesty, Beauty and Terror. The
Affairs of this Life with their reference to a Life to
come, would shine bright in a Dramatick Description.
The Anguish of inward Guilt, the secret Stings

and Racks and Scourges of Conscience, the sweet retiring
Hours and Seraphical Joys of Devotion, the
Victory of a Resolved Soul over a thousand Temptations,
the Inimitable Love and Passion of a Dying
God, the Awful Glories of the last Tribunal, the
grand Decisive Sentence from which there is no Appeal,
and the Consequent Transports or Horrors of
the two Eternal Worlds. How would such a Performance
call back the dying Piety of the Nation to
Life and Beauty: It would make Religion appear
like it self, and confound the Blasphemies of a profligate
World, ignorant of Pious Pleasures.But we have reason to fear that the Tuneful Men
of our Day have not rais'd their Ambition to so Divine
a Pitch; I should rejoyce to see more of this
Coelestial Fire kindling within them, for the Flashes
that break out in some present and past Writings betray
an Infernal Source. This the Incomparable
Mr. Cowley in the latter End of his Preface, and the
Ingenious Sir Richard Blackmore in the beginning of
his have so pathetically describ'd and lamented; and
I rather refer the Reader to mourn with them than
detain and tire him here. These Gentlemen in their
large and laboured Works of Poesie have given the
World happy Examples of what they wish and incourage
in Prose: The One in a rich Variety of
Thought and Fancy; the Other in all the Beauties
of Profuse and Florid Diction.If shorter Sonnets were compos'd on sublime Subjects,
such as the Psalms of David, and the Holy
Transports interspers'd in the other Sacred Writings,
or such as the Moral Odes of Horace, and the Ancient
Lyricks, I perswade my self that the Christian
Preacher would find abundant Aid from the Poet in
his Design to diffuse Vertue and allure Souls to
God. If the Heart were first inflam'd from Heaven,
and the Muse were not left alone to form the
Devotion and pursue a Cold Scent, but only call'd in
as an Assistant to the Worship, then the Song would
end where the Inspiration ceases; the whole Composure
would be of a Piece, all Meridian Light and
Meridian Fervor. And the same Pious Flame would
be propagated and kept glowing in the Heart of him
that reads. Some of the shorter Odes of the two
Poets now mentioned, and a few of the Reverend
Mr. Norris's Essays in Verse are convincing Instances
of the Success of this Proposal.'Tis my Opinion also that the free and unconfin'd
Measures of Pindar would best maintain the Dignity
of the Theme, as well as give a loose to the Devout
Soul, nor check the Raptures of her Faith and
Love. Tho' in my feeble Attempts of this kind I
have most unhappily fetter'd my Thoughts in the
narrow Numbers of our Old Psalm-Translators, I
have contracted and cramp't the Sense, or render'd
it obscure and feeble by the too speedy and regular
returns of Rhime.If my Friends expect a particular account of this
or any other Circumstance relating to what I here
Publish, they will be pleas'd to accept of this short
one.The TITLEAssures them that Poesy is not the Business of my
Life, and if I seized those Hours of Leisure wherein
my Soul was in a more sprightly and tuneful Frame
to entertain them or my self with a Divine or Moral
Song, I hope I shall find an Easy Pardon.The SONGS Sacred
to DEVOTIONWere never written with a design to appear before
the Judges of Wit, but only to assist the Meditations
and Worship of Vulgar Christians, to whom the Measures
of Hopkins by Custom are grown Familiar and
Natural, and esteemed almost Sacred by being bound
up in the same Volume with Scripture. These are
but a small part of two hundred Hymns of the same
kind which are ready for Public Use if the World
receive favourably what I now present. The Reason
that sent these out first, and divided them from
their Fellows, is, that in most of These there are
some Expressions which are not suited to the plainest
Capacities, and differ too much from the usual

Methods of Speech in which Holy Things are propos'd
to the general Part of Mankind.The ODES to VERTUE &c.Were form'd when the Frame and Humour of my
Soul was just suited to the Subject of my Verse:
The Image of my Heart is painted in them; and if
they meet with a Reader whose Soul is akin to mine,
perhaps they may agreeably entertain him. The
Dullness of the Fancy and Coarseness of Expression
will disappear, the sameness of the Humour will
create a Pleasure, and insensibly overcome and conceal
the Defects of the Muse.The IMITATIONSOf that Noblest Latin Poet of Modern Ages Casimire
Sarbiewski of Poland would need no Excuse,
did they but arise to the Beauty of the Original. I
have often taken the Freedom to add ten or twenty
Lines, or to leave out as many, that I might suit my
Song more to my own Design, or because I found it
Impossible to present the Force, the Fineness, and

the Fire of his Expression in our Language. I wish
some English Pen would import some of the Treasures
of that rich Genius and bless our Nation.The INSCRIPTIONSTo particular Friends are warranted and defended
by the Practise of the two best Lyric Writers Horace
and Casimire: And tho' the Authority of the first be
more Venerable, yet if in some Instances I prefer the
latter, I pray the Criticks to forgive me; and I hope
my Friends will excuse the Freedom of the Address.In the POEMS of HEROIC
MeasureI have attempted in Rhime the same variety of Cadence,
Comma, and Period, which Blank Verse
Glories in as its peculiar Elegance and Ornament.In the PINDARIQUESI have generally conformed my Lines to the shorter
Size of the Ancients, and avoided to imitate the Excessive
Lengths to which some Modern Writers have
stretched their Sentences, and especially the concluding
Verse. In these the Ear is the truest Judge,
nor was it made to be enslav'd to any precise Model
of Elder or Later Times.After all, I must petition my Reader to lay aside
the sowr and sullen Air of Criticism, and to assume
the Friend. Let him come with a design to be entertain'd
and pleas'd, rather than to seek his own Disgust
and Aversion, which will not be hard to find.
I am not so Vain as to think there are no Faults, nor
so Blind as to espy none: There is not one Copy that
intirely pleases me: The best of them sinks vastly
below the Idea which I form of a Divine or Moral
Ode. He that deals in the Mysteries of Heaven, or
of the Muses should be a Genius of no Vulgar Mould;
and as the Name of Vates belongs to both, so the
Furniture of Both is compriz'd in that Line of Horace,—Cui Mens Divinior, atque OsMagna Locuturum—
But what Juvenal spake in his Age abides true in
ours: A compleat Poet or a Prophet is such an one
—Qualem nequeo monstrare, & sentio tantùm.Perhaps neither of these Characters in Perfection
shall ever be seen on Earth, till the Seventh Angel
has sounded his Awful Trumpet, till the Victory be
compleat over the Beast and his Image; when the
Natives of Heaven shall joyn in Triumphal Consort
with Prophets and Tuneful Saints, and Sing unto
their Golden Harps, Salvation Honour and Glory to
him that sits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for
ever.A

Divine Sovereignty.I.GReat God, indulge a Mortal Tongue,Nor let thy Thunders roarWhilst little Notes and feeble SongAttempt th' Eternal Pow'r.II.Life, Death, and Hell, and Worlds unknownHang on thy firm Decree;Thou sit'st on no precarious Throne,Nor Borrowest leave to Be.III.Thy Sovereign Voice bids ancient NightHer Spacious Realms resign,And Lo! ten Thousand Globes of LightIn Fields of Azure shine.IV.Thy Wisdom with Superiour SwayGuides this vast moving Frame;Whilst all the Ranks of Being payDeep Reverence to thy Name.V.Vengeance attends t' obey thy Frown,And Blessings wait thy Smile;A Wreath of Lightning arms thy Crown,But Love adorns it still.VI.Unnumber'd Wonders in thee meet,And various Glory shines;The Crossing Rays too fiercely beatUpon our fainting Minds.VII.Angels are lost in sweet SurprizeIf thou unvail thy Grace;And humble Awe runs thro' the SkiesWhen Wrath arrays thy Face.VIII.When Mercy joyns with MajestyTo spread their Beams abroad,Not all the fairest Minds on highAre Shadows of a God.IX.Thy Mighty Works Great Gabriel SingsIn a too feeble Strain;And labours upon all his StringsTo reach thy Thoughts in vain.X.Created Powers how weak they be!How short our Praises fall!So much akin to Nothing We,And Thou th' Eternal All.THE
Transcendent Glories
OF THE
DEITY.I.GOD is a Name my Soul adores;Th' Almighty Three, th' Eternal One:Nature and Grace with all their PowersConfess the Infinite Unknown.II.From thy Great Self thy Being Springs;Thou art thine own Original;
Made up of Uncreated Things,And Self-Sufficience bears them all.III.Thy Voice hath form'd the Seas and Spheres,Bid the Waves roar, and Planets shine;But Nothing like thy Self appearsThro' all these Spacious Works of thine.IV.Still rolling Nature dies and grows;From Change to Change the Creatures run:Thy Being no Succession knows,And all thy vast Designs are One.V.A Glance of thine runs thro' the Globes,Rules the Bright Worlds, and moves their Frame:Broad Sheets of Light compose thy Robes;Thy Guards are form'd of living Flame.VI.Thrones and Dominions round thee fallAnd Worship in Submissive Forms;Thy Presence shakes this lower Ball,This little Dwelling Place of Worms.VII.Then how shall trembling Mortals dareTo sing thy Glory or thy Grace;Beneath thy Feet we lie so far,And see but Shadows of thy Face?VIII.Who can behold the Blazing Light?Who can approach Consuming Flame?None but thy Wisdom knows thy Might;None but thy Word can speak thy Name.GOD
Appears most Glorious
IN OUR
Salvation by CHRIST.I.FAther, how wide thy Glory shines!How high thy Wonders rise!Known thro' the Earth by thousand Signs,By thousand thro' the Skies.II.Those mighty Orbs proclaim thy Power,Their Motions speak thy Skill;And on the Wings of every HourWe read thy Patience still.III.Part of thy Name Divinely standsOn all thy Creatures writ;They show the Labour of thine Hands,Or Impress of thy Feet.IV.But when We view thy Strange DesignTo save Rebellious Worms,Where Vengeance and Compassion joynIn their Divinest Forms:V.Our Thoughts are lost in Reverend Awe,We Love and we Adore;The tallest Angel never sawSo much of God before.VI.Here the whole Deity is known,Nor dares a Creature guessWhich of the Glories brightest shone,The Justice or the Grace.VII.When we transgress'd the Fathers Laws,The dying Son atones;Oh the Dear Mysteries of his Cross!The Triumph of his Groans!VIII.Now the full Glories of the LambAdorn the Heavenly Plains;And the Young Cherubs learn his Name,And try their choicest Strains.IX.O may I bear some humble PartIn that Immortal Song;Wonder and Joy shall tune my Heart,And Love command my Tongue.AN
Hymn of Praise
TO
The God of ENGLAND,
FOR
Three Great Salvations.(VIZ.)I. From the Spanish Invasion, 1588.II. From the Gunpowder-Plot, Nov. 5.III. From Popery and Slavery by King William of
Glorious Memory, who landed Nov. 5. 1688.Compos'd Nov. 5. 1695.I.INfinite God, whose Counsels standLike Mountains of Eternal Brass,Pillars to prop our Sinking Land,Or Guardian Rocks to break the Seas.II.From Pole to Pole thy Name is known,Thee a Whole Heaven of Angels praise,Our Laboring Tongues would strike thy ThroneWith the Loud Triumphs of thy Grace.III.Part of thy Church by thy CommandStands rais'd upon the Brittish Isles,There, said the Lord, to Ages standFirm as the Everlasting Hills.IV.In vain the Spanish Ocean roar'd,And roll'd its Billows to our Shore;The Billows sunk beneath thy Word,And all the Floating War they bore.V.Come, said the Sons of bloody Rome,Let us provide new Arms from Hell,And down they digg'd thro' Earth's dark Womb,And ransack'd all the burning Cell.VI.Old Satan lent them fiery Stores,Infernal Coal, and Sulph'rous Flame,And all that burns, and all that roars,Outrageous Fires of dreadful Name.VII.Beneath the Senate and the ThroneEngines of Hellish Thunder lay,There the dark Seeds of Fire were sownTo spring a Bright, but dismal Day.VIII.Thy Love beheld the black Design,Thy Love that Guards thine England round;Strange! how it quench'd the fiery Mine,And crush'd the Tempest under Ground.THE
Second Part.I.ASsume my Tongue a Nobler Strain,Sing the New Wonders of the Lord;The Foes revive their Pow'rs again,Again they die beneath his Sword.II.Dark as our Thoughts our Minutes rollWhile Tyranny possest the Throne;And Murtherers of an Irish SoulRan threatning Death thro' every Town.III.The Roman Priest and Brittish PrinceJoyn'd their best Force and blackest Charms;And the fierce Troops of neighbouring FranceOffer'd the Service of their Arms.IV.'Tis done, they cry'd, and laught aloud,The Courts of Darkness rang with Joy,Th' Old Serpent hiss'd, and Hell grew proud,While Zion mourn'd her Ruine nigh.V.But lo! The great Deliverer SailsCommission'd from Jehovah's Hand;And Smiling Seas, and wishing GalesConvey him to the longing Land.VI.The happy Day and happy Year Nov. 5. 1688.Both in our new Salvation meet:The Day that quencht the Burning Snare, Nov. 5.And Year that burnt th' Invading Fleet. 1588.VII.Now did thine Arm, O God of Hosts,Now did thine Arm shine dazling bright;The Sons of Might their Hands had lost,And Men of Blood forgot to fight.VIII.Brigades of Angels lin'd the way,And guarded William to his Throne;There, ye Celestial Warriours, stay,And make his Palace like your own.IX.Thus, Mighty God, thy Praise DivineFrom Heaven and Earth at once shall flow;Angels and Men conspire and joynIn Hallelujahs, here below.X.All Hallelujah, Heavenly King,Tis thy Victorious Arm we sing;Fly round the Globe, ye Ecchoing Joys,And vaulted Skies repeat the Noise.GOD Incomprehensible.I.FAR in the Heav'ns my God retires,My God, the point of my Desires,And hides his Lovely Face;When he descends within my ViewHe charms my Reason to pursue,But leaves it tir'd and fainting in th' unequal Chase.II.Or if I reach unusual height,Till near his Presence brought;There Floods of Glory check my Flight,Cramp the bold Pinions of my WitAnd all untune my Thought;Plung'd in a Sea of Light I roll,Where Wisdom, Justice, Mercy Shines;Infinite Rays in Crossing LinesBeat thick Confusion on my Sight, and overwhelm
my Soul.III.Come to my aid, ye Fellow-Minds,And help me reach the Throne,(What single Strength in vain designs,United Force hath done;Thus Worms may Joyn, and grasp the Poles,Thus Atoms fill the Sea,)But the whole Race of Creature-Souls,Stretch'd to their last extent of Thought plunge and
are lost in Thee.IV.Great God; behold my Reason liesAdoring; yet my Love would riseOn Pinions not her own:Faith shall direct her humble FlightThro' all the trackless Seas of LightTo Thee th' Eternal Fair, the Infinite Unknown.SICKNESS
GIVES A
Sight of HEAVEN.I.OFT have I sat in Secret SighsTo feel my Flesh decay,Then groan'd aloud with frighted EyesTo view this tott'ring Clay.II.But I forbid my Sorrows now,Nor dares the Flesh complain,Diseases bring their Profit too;The Joy o'recomes the Pain.III.My chearful Soul now all the DaySits waiting here and Sings;
Looks thro' the Ruins of her Clay,And practises her Wings.IV.Faith almost changes into Sight,While from afar she SpiesHer fair Inheritance in LightAbove created Skies.V.Had but the Prison-Walls been strong,And firm without a flaw,In Darkness she had dwelt too long,And less of Glory saw.VI.But now the Everlasting HillsThro' every Chink appear,And something of the Joy she feelsWhile she's a Pris'ner here.VII.The Shines of Heaven rush sweetly inAt all the Gaping Flaws,Visions of Endless Bliss are seen,And Native Air she draws.VIII.O may these Walls stand tott'ring still,The Breaches never close,If I must here in Darkness dwell,And all this Glory lose.IX.Or rather let this Flesh decay,The Ruins wider grow,Till glad to see the Enlarged wayI stretch my Pinions thro'.THE

Appear in all your Dreadful Forms,And speak his awful Hand.VIII.Shout to the Lord, ye Surging Seas,In your Eternal Roar,Let Wave to Wave resound his Praise,And Shore reply to Shore:IX.While Monsters rolling on the FloodIn Scaly Silver shine,Speak terribly their Maker-God,And lash the foaming Brine.X.But Gentler Things shall tune his NameTo softer Notes than these,Young Zephyrs breathing o're the Stream,Or whispering thro' the Trees.XI.Wave your tall Heads, ye lofty Pines,To him that bid you grow,Sweet Clusters, bend the fruitful VinesOn every Thankful Bough.XII.Let the shrill Birds his Honour raise,And tune it in the Sky:While groveling Beasts attempt his PraiseWith hoarser Harmony.XIII.Thus while the meaner Creatures sing,Ye Mortals take the Sound,Eccho the Glories of your KingThro' all the Nations round.XIV.Th' Eternal Name must fly abroadFrom England to Japan;And the whole Race shall bow to GodThat owns the Name of Man.THE

On His THRONE.I.NOW let my Faith grow strong and rise,And view my Lord in all his Love;Look back to hear his Dying Cries,Then mount and see his Throne above.II.See where he Languish'd on the Cross;Beneath my Sins he groan'd and dy'd;See where he fits to plead my CauseBy his Almighty Father's Side.III.If I behold his Bleeding Heart,There Love in Floods of Sorrow reigns,He triumphs o're the Killing Smart,And buys my Pleasure with his Pains.IV.Or if I climb th' Eternal HillsWhere the dear Conqueror sits enthron'd,Still in his Heart Compassion dwellsNear the Memorials of his Wound.V.How shall a pardon'd Rebel showHow much I Love my Dying God?Lord, here I banish every Foe,I hate the Sins that Cost thy Blood.VI.I hold no more Commerce with Hell,My dearest Lusts shall all depart;But let thine Image ever dwellStampt as a Seal upon my Heart.DEATH
A
Welcome Messenger.I.LORD, when we see a Saint of thineLie gasping out his Breath,With Longing Eyes, and Looks Divine,Smiling, and pleas'd in Death;II.How we could e'en contend to layOur Limbs upon that Bed,And ask thine Envoy to conveyOur Spirits in his stead.III.Our Souls are rising on the WingTo venture in his Place,
For when grim Death has lost his Sting,He has an Angels Face.IV.Jesus, then purge my Crimes away,'Tis Guilt creates my Fears,'Tis Guilt gives Death its fierce Array,And all the Arms it bears.V.Oh, if my threatning Sins were gone,And Death had lost his Sting,I could invite the Angel on,And chide his lazy Wing.VI.Away these interposing Days,And let the Lovers meet;The Angel has a cold Embrace,But kind, and soft, and sweet.VII.I'de leap at once my Seventy Years,And fly into his Arms,And  and all my Careseavenly Charms.VIII.Joyful I'd lay this Body down,And leave the lifeless Clay,Without a Sigh, without a Groan,And Stretch and soar away.Sincere Praise.I.ALmighty Maker God!How wondrous is thy Name!Thy Glories how diffus'd abroadThro' the Creations Frame!II.Nature in every DressHer humble Homage Pays,And takes a Thousand Ways t' expressThine Undissembled Praise.III.In Native White and RedThe Rose and Lilly stand,
And free from Pride their Beauties spreadTo show thy skilful Hand.IV.The Lark mounts up the SkyWith Unambitious Song,And bears her Maker's Praise on highUpon her Artless Tongue.V.My Soul would rise and SingTo her Creator too,Fain would my Tongue adore my King,And Pay the Worship due.VI.But Pride that busie SinSpoils all that I perform,Curs'd Pride, that creeps securely in,And swells a haughty Worm.VII.Thy Glories I abate,Or praise thee with Design;Some of thy Favours I forget,Or would have something mine.VIII.The very Songs I frameAre Faithless to thy Cause,And steal the Honours of thy NameUnto their own Applause.IX.Create my Soul anew,Else all my Worship's vain;This wretched Heart will ne'er be trueUntil 'tis form'd again.X.Descend Celestial Fire,And seize me from above,Melt me in Flames of pure DesireA Sacrifice to Love.XI.Let Joy and Worship spendThe Remnant of my Days,And to my God my Soul ascendIn sweet Perfumes of Praise.GOD's Infinity.I.SOME Seraph, lend your Heavenly Tongue,Or Harp of Golden String,That I may raise a lofty SongTo our Eternal King.II.Thy Names, how Infinite they be!Great Everlasting One!Boundless thy Might and Majesty,And Unconfin'd thy Throne.III.Thy Glories shine of Wondrous Size,And wondrous Large thy Grace,Immortal Day breaks from thine Eyes,And Gabriel Vails his Face.IV.Thine Essence is a vast AbyssWhich Angels cannot sound,
An Ocean of InfinitiesWhere all our thoughts are drownd.V.The Mysteries of Creation lieBeneath Enlightned Minds,Thoughts can ascend above the Sky,And fly before the Winds.VI.Reason may grasp the Massie Hills,And stretch from Pole to Pole,But Half thy Name our Spirit fills,And Overloads our Soul.VII.In vain our Haughty Reason swells,For Nothing's found in TheeBut Boundless Unconceivables,And Vast Eternity.LONGING FOR
The Second Coming
OF
CHRIST.I.WHEN shall thy Shining Face be seen?When shall our Eyes behold our God?What lengths of Distance lie between,And Hills of Guilt, a Heavy Load!II.Our Months are Ages of Delay,And slowly every Minute wears;Fly winged Time, and roll awayThese tedious Rounds of Sluggish Years.III.Ye Heavenly Gates, loose all your Chains,Let the Eternal Pillars bow,
Dear Saviour, Cleave the Starry Plains,And make the Chrystal Mountains flow.IV.Hark how thy Saints unite their Cries,And pray and wait the General Doom,Come, thou the Soul of all our Joys,Thou the Desire of Nations, come.V.Put thy bright Robes of Triumph on,And bless our Eyes, and bless our Ears,Thou absent Love, thou Dear Unknown,Thou Fairest of ten thousand Fairs.VI.Our Heart-strings groan with deep Complaint,Our Flesh lies panting, Lord, for thee,And every Limb and every JoyntStretches for Immortality.VII.Our Spirits shake their Eager Wings,And burn to meet thy rolling Throne,We rise away from Mortal thingsTo attend thy Shining Chariot down!VIII.Now let our Chearful Eyes surveyThe blazing Earth and melting Hills,And smile to see the Lightnings play,And flash along before thy Wheels.IX.O for a shout of Violent JoysTo Joyn the Trumpets thundring sound!The Angel Herald shakes the Skies,Awakes the Graves, and tears the Ground.X.Ye Slumbring Saints, a Heavenly HostStands waiting at your gaping Tombs,Let every Sacred Sleeping DustLeap into Life, for Jesus comes.XI.Jesus the God of Might and LoveNew moulds our Limbs of Cumbrous Clay,Quick as Seraphick Flames we move,Active and Young and Fair as they.XII.Our airy Feet with unknown flightSwift as the motions of DesireRun up the Hills of Heavenly Light,And leave the Weltring World in Fire.THE
Sufferings and Glories
OF
CHRIST.A SONG In Trisyllable Feet.I.I Long for a Consort of Heavenly Praise,To Jesus the God, the Omnipotent Son,My Voice should awake in Harmonious Lays,Could it tell half the Wonders that Jesus has done.II.I would sing how he left his own Palace of Light,And Robes made of Glory that dress'd him above;Yet pleas'd with his Journey, and swift was his Flight,For he rode on the Pinions of Infinite Love.III.Far down to the Place of our distant AbodeHe came (we adore him) to raise us on high;He came to attone the Revenge of a God,And he took up a Life to be able to die.IV.All Hell and its Lyons stood Roaring around,His Flesh and his Spirit with Malice they tore;While Worlds of Sorrow lay pressing him down,As vast as the Burden of Sins that he bore.V.Fast bound in the Chains of Imperious DeathThe Infinite Captive a Prisoner lay,The Infinite Captive arose from the Earth,And leap't to the Hills of Ethereal Day.VI.Then mention no more of the Wrath of a God;Of the Lyons of Hell and their Roarings no more;We lift up our Eyes to his Shining Abode,And our loudest Hosannahs his Name shall adore.VII.We crown the Triumpher with the Honours he won,Hosannah thro' all the Coelestial Groves!The God and the Man! how he fills up his Throne!How He sits! how He shines! how He looks! how
He Loves!VIII.O happy ye Heavens, and happy ye HillsWhere he treads with his Feet and diffuseth his Grace,While Mercy and Majesty, Glories and SmilesPlay gently around the sweet Air of his Face.IX.Amongst a  Choir of Archangels and SongsThe Mighty Redeemer Eternally reigns,And the Sound of his Name from a Million of
TonguesFlies o're the bright Mountains and blesses the Plains.THE
Day of Judgment.An ODE,
Attempted in English Sapphick.I.WHEN the Fierce North-wind with his
Airy ForcesRears up the Baltick to a foaming Fury,And the red Lightning with a Storm of Hail comesRushing amain down,II.How the poor Sailers stand amaz'd and tremble!While the hoarse Thunder like a Bloody TrumpetRoars a loud onset to the gaping WatersQuick to devour them.III.Such shall the Noise be and the Wild disorder,(If things Eternal may be like these Earthly)Such the dire Terror when the great ArchangelShakes the Creation,IV.Tears the strong Pillars of the Vault of Heaven,Breaks up old Marble the Repose of Princes;See the Graves open, and the Bones arising,Flames all around 'em.V.Hark the shrill Out-cries of the Guilty Wretches!Lively bright Horror and amazing AnguishStare thro' their Eyelids, while the living Worm liesGnawing within them.VI.Thoughts like old Vultures prey upun their Heartstrings,And the smart twinges, when their Eye beholds theLofty Judge frowning, and a Flood of VengeanceRolling afore him.VII.Hopeless Immortals! how they scream and shiverWhile Devils push them to the Pit wide YawningHideous and gloomy, to receive them headlongDown to the Centre.VIII.Stop here my Fancy: (All away ye horridDoleful Ideas;) Come arise to Jesus,How he sits Godlike! And the Saints around himThron'd and adoring!IX.O may I sit there when he comes TriumphantDooming the Nations: Then arise to Glory,While our Hosannahs all along the PassageShout the Redeemer.Confession and Pardon.I.ALAS my aking Heart!Here the keen Torment lies;It racks my waking Hours with Smart,And frights my Slumbring Eyes.II.Guilt will be hid no more,My Griefs take vent apace,The Crimes that blot my Conscience o'reFlush Crimson in my Face.III.My Sorrows like a FloodImpatient of RestraintInto thy Bosom, O my God,Pour out a long Complaint.IV.This impious Heart of mineCould once defie the Lord,Could rush with Violence on to SinIn presence of thy Sword.V.As often have I stoodA Rebel to the Skies,The Calls, the Tenders of a God,And Mercies Loudest cries.VI.He offers all his Grace,And all his Heaven to me;Offers! But 'tis to senseless BrassThat can nor feel nor see.VII.Jesus the Saviour standsTo court me from above,And looks and spreads his wounded Hands,And shows the Prints of Love.VIII.But I, a stupid Fool,How long have I withstoodThe Blessings purchas'd with his Soul,And paid for all in Blood?IX.The Heav'nly Dove came downAnd tender'd me his Wings,To mount me upward to a CrownAnd bright Immortal things.X.Lord, I'm asham'd to sayThat I refus'd thy Dove,And sent thy Spirit griev'd awayTo his own Realms of Love.XI.Nor all thine Heav'nly Charms,Nor thy revenging HandCould force me to lay down my Arms,And bow to thy Command.XII.Lord, 'tis against thy FaceMy Sins like Arrows rise,And yet, and yet (O matchless Grace)Thy Thunder silent lies.XIII.O shall I never feelThe Meltings of thy Love?Am I of such Hell-harden'd SteelThat Mercy cannot move?XIV.Now for one powerful GlanceDear Saviour, from thy Face!This Rebel-heart no more withstands,But sinks beneath thy Grace.XV.O'recome by dying Love I fall,And at thy Cross I lie;I throw my Flesh, my Soul, my All,And Weep, and Love, and Die.XVI."Rise, says the Prince of Mercy, rise;With Joy and Pity in his Eyes:"Rise and behold my wounded Veins,"Here flows the Blood to wash thy Stains.XVII."See, my Great Father's reconcil'd:He say'd, and Lo the Father smil'd;The Joyful Cherubs clapt their Wings,And sounded Grace on all their Strings.JESUS
THE
Only SAVIOUR.I.ADAM, our Head, our Father fell,And Justice doom'd the Race to Hell:The fiery Law speaks all Despair,There's no Reprieve, nor Pardon there.II.Call a bright Council in the Skies:"Seraphs, the Mighty and the Wise,"Say, what Expedient can you give"That Sin be damn'd and Sinners live?III."Speak, are you strong to bear the Load,"The weighty Vengeance of a God?"Which of you loves our wretched Race,"Or dares to venture in our Place?IV.In vain we ask: For all aroundStands Silence thro' the Heavenly Ground:There's not a glorious Mind aboveHas half the Strength, or half the Love.V.But, O unutterable Grace!Th' Eternal Son takes Adam's place;Down to our World the Saviour flies,Stretches his naked Arms and Dies.VI.Justice was pleas'd to bruise the God,And pay its Wrongs with Heavenly Blood;Infinite Racks and Pangs He bore,And rose. The Law could ask no more.VII.Amazing Work! Look down, ye Skies,Wonder and gaze with all your Eyes,Ye Heavenly Thrones stoop from above,And bow to this Mysterious Love.VIII.See, how they bend! See, how they look!Long they had read th' Eternal Book,And study'd dark Decrees in vain,The Cross and Calvary makes them plain.IX.Now they are struck with deep Amaze,Each with his Wings conceals his Face;Now clap their sounding Plumes, and cry,"The Wisdom of a Diety.X.Low they adore th' Incarnate Son,And sing the Glories he hath won,Sing how he broke our Iron Chains,How deep he sunk, how high he reigns.XI.Triumph and reign Victorious Lord,By all thy flaming Saints ador'd;And say, dear Conqueror, say, how long'Ere we shall fly to joyn their Song?XII.Lo, from afar the promis'd DayShines with a well-distinguish'd Ray:But my wing'd Passion hardly bearsThese tedious Rounds of rolling Years.XIII.Send down a Chariot from aboveWith fiery Wheels, and pav'd with Love;Raise me beyond th' Ethereal Blue,To Sing and Love as Angels do.A
Song of Praise
TO
GOD.PSALM C. In Trissyllable Feet.I.SIng aloud to the Lord: Let the two Frozen PolesAwake to the Song, and dissolve in the Praise;At the Fiery Line will we kindle our Souls,Nor the Worship be quench't by the Western Seas.II.Come Nations adoring the Infinite King,With Zeal in your Bosoms, and Joy in your Eyes:His Wonderful Name should eternally ringRound the broad Globe of Earth to the Circling Skies.III.'Twas he that gave Life to our Souls with a Breath,He fashion'd our Clay to the Figure of Men;And when we had stray'd to the Regions of Death,He reduc'd his own Sheep to his Pastures again.IV.We enter his Gates with Hosannahs and Songs,The Arches resound with the Notes that we raise;Thus while our Devotions are paid with our Tongues,Thy Temple adores by repeating the Praise.V.Thy Power shakes the World, and makes it self known;Thy Love like Eternity has ne're a Bound;The Truth of our God must stand firm as his ThroneWhen the Wheels of old Time shall cease to go round.An Essay on a few of DAVID's
PSALMS Translated into Plain Verse,

Revelations of the Gospel.THE
HAPPY SAINT
AND
Cursed Sinner.PSALM I.I.BLEST is the Man, whose cautious FeetShun the broad Path which Sinners chuse,Who hates the House where Atheists meet,And dreads the Words that Scoffers use.II.He loves t' employ his Morning LightReading the Statutes of the Lord,And spends the wakeful Hours of NightWith Pleasure pond'ring o're the Word.III.He like a Plant by gentle StreamsShall Flourish in Immortal Green;And Heav'n will shine with Kindest BeamsOn every Work his Hands begin.IV.But Sinners find their Counsels cross'd:As Chaff before the Tempest flies,So shall their Hopes be blown and lostWhen the last Trumpet shakes the Skies.V.In vain the Rebel crouds to standIn Judgment with the Pious Race;The dreadful Judge with Stern CommandDivides him to a different Place.VI."Strait is the Way my Saints have trod,"I blest the Path and drew it plain:"But you would chuse the crooked Road,"And it leads down t' Eternal Pain.Doubts and Fears
SUPPRES'D.PSALM III.I.LOOK, Gracious God, how numerous theyWhose envious Power and RageConspiring my Eternal DeathAgainst my Soul engage.II.The lying Tempter would perswadeThere's no Relief in Heaven;
And all my swelling Sins appearToo big to be forgiven.III.But God my Glory and my StrengthShall tread the Tempter down,And drown my Sins beneath the BloodOf his Dear Dying Son.IV.I cry'd, and from his Sacred HillHe bow'd a list'ning Ear;I call'd my Father and my God,And he dispers'd my Fear.V.He threw soft Slumbers on mine EyesIn sight of all my Foes,I 'woke, and wondred at the GraceThat guarded my Repose.VI.What, tho' the Hosts of Death and HellAll arm'd against me stood,Terrors no more shall shake my Soul,Nor Tremblings chill my Blood.VII.Lord, I adore thy Wondrous Love,And thy Salvation sing:My God hath broke the Serpents Teeth,And Death has lost his Sting.VIII.Salvation to the Lord belongs,The Lord alone can save;Blessings attend thy People here,And reach beyond the Grave.Praise to the LORD
FROM
All NATIONS.PSALM C.I.SING to the Lord with Joyful Voice,Let every Land his Name adore,The Brittish Isles shall send the NoiseAcross the Ocean to the Shore.II.With gladness bow before his Throne,And let his Presence raise your Joys,Know that the Lord is God alone,And form'd our Souls, and fram'd our Voice.III.Infinite Power without our aidFigur'd our Clay to humane Mould;And when our Wandring Feet had stray'd,He brought us to his Sacred Fold.IV.Enter his Gates with Thankful Songs,Thro' his Wide Courts your Voices raise;Almighty God, our Joyful TonguesShall fill thine house with sounding Praise.V.Wide as the World is thy Command,Vast as Eternity thy Love,Firm as a Rock thy Truth must standWhen rolling Years shall cease to move.Brotherly Love.PSALM CXXXIII.I.LO, what an entertaining SightAre Brethren that agree,Brethren whose chearful Hearts uniteIn Bands of Piety.II.When Streams of Love from Christ the SpringDescend to every Soul,And Sacred Peace with Balmy WingShades and bedews the whole;III.'Tis like the Oyl on Aaron shedWhich choice Perfumes compose,Down softly from his Reverend HeadIt trickled to his Toes.IV.Tis pleasant as the Morning DewsThat fall on Zion's Hill;Where God his mildest Glory shews,And makes his Grace distil.THE
PLEASURE
OF
Love to CHRIST
Present or Absent.I.OF all the Joys we Mortals knowJesus, thy Love exceeds the rest;Love, the best Blessing here below,And nearest Image of the Blest.II.Sweet are my Thoughts, and soft my CaresWhen the dear Heav'nly Flame I feel; all my Hopes and all my FearsThere's something kind and pleasing still.III.While I am held in his EmbraceThere's not a Thought attempts to rove;Each Smile he wears upon his FaceFixes and charms and fires my Love.IV.He speaks, and strait Immortal JoysRun thro' my Ears, and reach my Heart;My Soul all melts at that dear Voice,And Pleasure shoots thro' every Part.V.If he withdraw a Moments spaceHe leaves a Sacred Pledge behind,Here in this Breast his Image stays,The Grief and Comfort of my Mind.VI.While of his Absence I complain,And long, and weep as Lovers do,There's a strange Pleasure in the Pain,And Tears have their own Sweetness too.VII.When round his Courts by Day I rove,Or ask the Watchmen of the NightFor some kind Tidings of my Love;His very Name creates Delight.VIII.Jesus my God; yet rather come;Mine Eyes would dwell upon thy Face;'Tis best to see my Lord at Home,And feel the Presence of his Grace.The Substance of the following
Copy, and many of the Lines as they
here stand were sent me by an Esteemed
Friend Mr. W. Nokes, with a desire that
I would form them into a Pindarick
Ode; but I retain'd his Measures least
I should too much alter his Sense.A
Sight of CHRIST.ANgels of Light, your God and King surroundWith Noble Songs; in his Exalted FleshHe claims your Worship; while his Saints on EarthBless their Redeemer-God with humble Tongues.Angels with lofty Honours crown his Head;We bowing at his Feet, by Faith may feelThis distant Influence, and confess his Love.Once I beheld his Face, when Beams DivineBroke from his Eyelids, and unusual LightWrap't me at once in Glory and Surprize.My Joyful Heart high leaping in my BreastWith Transport cry'd, This is the Christ of God;Then threw my Arms around in sweet Embrace,And clasp'd, and bow'd Adoring low, till I was lost
in him.While he appears no other Charms can holdOr draw my Soul asham'd of former things,Which no Remembrance now deserve or NameTho' with Contempt, best in Oblivion hid.But the bright Shine and Presence soon withdrew;I sought him whom I Love, but found him not;I felt his Absence; and with strongest criesProclaim'd, Where Jesus is not, all is vain.Whether I hold him with a full Delight,Or seek him panting with Extream Desire,'Tis He alone can please my Wondring Soul;
To hold or seek him is my only Choice.If he refrain on me to cast his EyeDown from his Palace, nor my longing SoulWith upward Look can spy my Dearest LordThro' his Blue Pavement, I'll behold him stillWith sweet reflection on the peaceful Cross,All in his Blood and Anguish, groaning deep,Gasping and dying there.—This Sight I ne're can loose, by it I live:A Quickning Vertue from his Death inspir'dIs Life and Breath to me; His Flesh my Food;His Vital Blood I drink, and hence my Strength.I Live, I'm Strong, and now Eternal LifeBeats quick within my Breast; my Vigorous MindSpurns the dull Earth, and on her fiery WingsReaches the Mount of Purposes Divine,Counsels of Peace betwixt th' Almighty ThreeConceiv'd at once, and Sign'd without DebateIn perfect Union of the Eternal Mind.With vast Amaze I see the Unfathom'd Thoughts,Infinite Schemes, and Infinite Designs
Of God's own Heart in which he ever rests.Eternity lies open to my View;Here the Beginning and the End of allI can discover; Christ, the End of all,And Christ the great Beginning; He my Head,My God, my Glory, and my All in All.O that the Day, the joyful Day were comeWhen the first Adam from his Ancient DustCrown'd with new Honours shall revive, and seeJesus his Son and Lord; while shouting SaintsSurround their King, and God's Eternal SonShines in the midst but with Superior Beams,And like himself; Then the Mysterious WordLong hid behind the Letter shall appearAll Spirit and Life, and in the fullest LightStand forth to publick View, and there discloseHis Father's Sacred Works and wondrous Ways:Then Wisdom, Righteousness and Grace DivineThro' all the Infinite Transactions pastInwrought and shining shall with double blaze
Strike our astonish't Eyes, and ever reignAdmir'd and Glorious in Triumphant Light.Death and the Tempter, and the Man of SinNow at the Bar arraign'd, in Judgment cast,Shall vex the Saints no more, but perfect LoveAnd loudest Praises perfect Joy create,While ever-circling Years maintain the blissful State.LONGING FOR
HEAVEN,
OR, THE
Song of Angels Above.I.EARTH has detain'd me Prisoner long,And I'me grown weary now;My Heart, my Hand, my Ear, my Tongue,There's nothing here for you.II.Tir'd in my Thoughts I stretch me down,And upward glance mine Eyes,Upward (my Father) to thy Throne,And to my Native Skies.III.There the dear Man my Saviour sits,The God, how bright he shines!
And scatters Infinite DelightsOn all the happy Minds.IV.Seraphs with elevated StrainsCircle the Throne around,And Move and Charm the Starry PlainsWith an Immortal Sound.V.Jesus the Lord their Harps employs,Jesus my Love they sing,Jesus the Name of both our JoysSounds sweet from every String.VI.Hark, how beyond the narrow BoundsOf Time and Space they run,And speak in most Majestick SoundsThe Godhead of the Son.VII.How on the Father's Breast he layThe darling of his Soul,Infinite Years before the Day,Or Heavens began to roll.VIII.And now they sink the lofty Tone,And milder Notes they play,And bring th' Eternal Godhead downTo dwell in humble Clay.IX.O the dear Beauties of that Man!(The God resides within)His Flesh all pure without a Stain,His Soul without a Sin.X.Then, how he look't, and how he smild,What wondrous things he said,Sweet Cherubs, stay, dwell here a while,And tell what Jesus did.XI.At his Command the Blind awake,And feel the gladsome Rays;He bids the Dumb attempt to speak,They try their Tongues in Praise.XII.He shed a thousand Blessings roundWhere 'ere he turn'd his Eye;He spake, and at the Sovereign SoundThe Hellish Legions fly.XIII.Thus while with unambitious StrifeTh' Ethereal Minstrels roveThro' all the Labours of his Life,And Wonders of his Love.XIV.In the full Quire a broken StringGroans with a strange Surprize;The rest in silence mourn their KingThat Bleeds and Loves and Dies.XV.The little Saints with dropping WingsCease their harmonious Breath,No blooming Trees, nor bubbling Springs,While Jesus sleeps in Death.XVI.Then all at once to living StrainsThey summon every Chord,Break up the Tomb, and burst his Chains,And show their rising Lord.XVII.Around the flaming Army throngsTo guard him to the Skies,With loud Hosannahs on their Tongues,And Triumph in their Eyes.XVIII.In awful State the Conquering GodAscends his shining Throne,While tuneful Angels sound abroadThe Vict'ries he has won.XIX.Now let me rise, and Joyn their Song,And be an Angel too;My Heart, my Hand, my Ear, my Tongue,Here's Joyful Work for you.XX. would begin the Musick hereAnd so my Soul should rise,Oh for some Heavenly Notes to bearMy Spirit to the Skies!XXI.There, ye that love my Saviour, sit,There I would fain have place,Amongst your Thrones, or at your Feet,So I might see his Face.XXII. am confin'd to Earth no more,But mount in haste aboveTo bless the God that I adore,And sing the Man I Love.GOD
Sovereign and Gracious.I.THE Lord! how fearful is his Name?How wide is his Command?Nature with all its Mighty FrameLies rolling in his Hand.II.Immortal Glory forms his Throne,And Light his Awful Robe;Whilst with a Smile or with a FrownHe manages the Globe.III.A Word of His Almighty BreathCan swell or sink the Seas;Build the vast Empires of the Earth,Or break 'em as he please.IV.Adoring Angels round him fallIn all their Shining Forms,His Sovereign Eye looks thro' them all,And pities Mortal Worms.V.His Bowels to our Worthless RaceIn sweet Compassion move;He Cloaths his Looks with softest Grace,And takes his Title, Love.VI.Now let the Lord for ever Reign,And Sway us as he will,Sick or in Health, in Ease or Pain,We are his Favourites still.VII.No more shall peevish Passion rise,The Tongue no more Complain;'Tis Sovereign Love that lends our Joys,And Love resumes again.THE
HAZARD
OF
Loving the Creatures.I.WHERE'ere my Flatt'ring Passions roveI find a lurking Snare;'Tis dangerous to let loose our LoveBeneath th' Eternal Fair.II.Souls whom the Tye of Friendship binds,And Things that share our BloodSeize a large Portion of our Minds,And leave the less for God.III.Nature hath soft but powerful Bands,And Reason She controuls;
While Children with their little HandsHang closest to our Souls.IV.Thoughtless they act th' Old Serpent's Part;What tempting things they be!Lord, how they twine about our Heart,And draw it off from thee!V.Our hasty Wills rush blindly onWhere rising Passion rolls,And thus we make our Fetters strongTo bind our Slavish Souls.VI.Dear Sovereign, break these Fetters off,And set our Spirits free;God in himself is Bliss enough,For we have all in thee.Christ's Amazing Love
AND
My Amazing Coldness.I.COME let me Love: or is my MindHarden'd to Stone, or froze to Ice?I see the Blessed Fair One bendAnd stoop t' embrace me from the Skies!II.O 'tis a Thought would melt a Rock,And make a Heart of Iron move,That those sweet Lips, that Heavenly LookShould seek my Kisses and my Love.III.I was a Traytor doom'd to Fire,Bound to sustain Immortal Pains;He flew on Wings of strong DesireAssum'd my Guilt, and took my Chains.IV.Infinite Grace! Almighty Charms!Stand in Amaze, ye rolling Skies,Jesus the God with naked ArmsHangs on a Cross of Love and Dies.V.Did Pity ever stoop so lowDrest in Divinity and Blood?Was ever Rebel courted soIn Groans of an Expiring God?VI.Again He lives; and spreads his Hands,Hands that were nay l'd to tort'ring Smart;"By these dear Wounds, says He, and standsAnd prays to clasp me to his Heart.VII.Sure I must Love; or are my EarsStill Deaf, nor feel the Passion move?Then let me melt my Heart to Tears,And Die because I cannot Love.Wishing him ever with me.I.NOW be that smiling Moment blestWhen First I saw my Love,Jesus, the Fairest and the BestOf all the Forms above.A thousand Graces ever riseAnd bloom upon his Face,A thousand Arrows from his EyesShoot thro' my Heart with sweet Surprize,And stand to guard the Place.II.All Natures Art shall never cureThe Heavenly Pains I found,And 'tis beyond all Beauties PowerTo make another Wound:Earthly Beauties grow and fade,Nature may heal the Wounds She made,But Charms so much Divine
Hold a long Empire of the Heart,What Heaven has joyn'd shall never part,And Jesus must be mine.III.In vain the envious Shades of Night,Or Flatteries of the DayWould vail his Image from my Sight,Or tempt my Soul away;Jesus is all my Waking Theme,His Lovely Form meets every Dream,And knows not to depart:The Passion reignsThro' all my Veins,And floating round the Crimson StreamStill finds him at my Heart.IV.Dwell there, for ever dwell, my Love;Here I confine my Sence,Nor dare my Wildest Wishes rove,Nor stir a Thought from thence.Let me be lost in thine EmbraceAs Rivers in the Sea;
Or live Eternity of DaysTo spend them all with thee.Still I would lie in those dear ArmsDissolving still among thy Charms,And as the Moments fly,I'de Breathe away successive Souls,So Billow after Billow rollsTo kiss the Shoar, and Dye.THE
Absence of the Beloved.I.COME, lead me to some lofty ShadeWhere Turtles moan their Loves;Tall Shadows were for Lovers made,And Grief becomes the Groves.II.Tis no mean Beauty of the GroundThat has inslav'd mine Eyes,

There at a Humble distance from the ThroneBeauteous She lies; Her Lustre all her own,Ungarnish'd; yet not blushing, nor afraid,Nor knows Suspicion, nor affects the Shade.In Words of Solemn Form, or with a freer CryWarm as our Zeal for Thee, We Both address the Sky,Vow for thy Safety Both, and live beneath thine Eye.PRINCESS, the World already owns thy Name;Go, mount the Chariot of Immortal Fame,Nor Die to be Renown'd: Fames loudest BreathToo dear is purchas'd by an Angels Death.The Thunder of thy Hand with general JoyShall crush Rebellion and the Rival Boy:Thy Sounding Arms his Gallick Patron hears,And speeds his Flight; nor overtakes his FearsTill hard Despair wring from the Tyrant's SoulThe Iron Tears out. Let thy Frown controulOur Angry Jarrs at Home, till Wrath submitHer Bloody Banners to thine Awful Feet▪
Mad Zeal and Frenzy with their Murtherous TrainFlee these Blest Realms in thine Auspicious Reign,Envy expire in Rage, and Treason bite the Chain.Let no black Scenes affright the Brittish Stage,Thy Thread of Life prolong our Golden Age,Long bless the Earth: Then rise and shine on highThe fairest Glory of the Western Sky;There check the Rays of each Malignant Star,Heal the dire Pestilence, forbid the War,Warm the chill North, Sooth the two Rugged Bears,And stretch thy Peaceful Influence to the Southern
Spheres.TO

afflict her whom we Honour and Love: I know also
that your Hurries of Business must be more than doubled

behind us: The past Temptations shall vex us no more,

the Months that are gone return not, and the Sorrows
that we hourly feel lessen the decreed Number;
every Pulse beats a Moment of Pain away, and thus by
Degrees we arrive nearer to the sweet Period of Life
and Trouble.Bear up (my dear Ones) thro' the ruffling StormsOf a vain vexing World: Tread down the CaresThose ragged Thorns that lie across the Road,Nor spend a Tear upon 'em. Trust me, Sisters,The Dew of Eyes will make the Briars grow.Nor let the distant Phantom of DelightToo long allure your Gaze, or swell your HopeTo dangerous size: If it approach your FeetAnd court your Hand, forbid the Intruding JoyTo sit too near your Heart: Still may our SoulsClaim Kindred with the Skies, nor mix with DustOur betterborn Affections: Leave the GlobeA Nest for Worms, and hasten to our Home.O there are Gardens of th' Immortal KindThat Crown the Heavenly Edens rising HillsWith Beauty and with Sweets; no Lurking MischiefDwells in the Fruit, nor Serpent twines the Boughs:

Stands firm on its own Base, and reigns as wide,As Absolute; and sways ten thousand Slaves,Lusts and wild Fancies with a Soveraign Hand.We are a little Kingdom: But the ManThat chains his Rebel Will to Reasons ThroneForms it a large one, ATWOOD, whilst his MindMakes Heaven its Council, from the Rolls aboveDraws his own Statutes, and with Joy obeys.'Tis not a Troop of Well-appointed GuardsCreate a Monarch, not a Purple RobeDy'd in the Peoples Blood, not all the CrownsOr dazling Tiars that bend about the Head,Tho' Gilt with Sun-Beams and beset with Stars.A Monarch He that Conquers all his FearsAnd treads upon them; when he stands alone,Makes his own Camp; four Guardian Virtues waitHis Nightly Slumbers and secure his Dreams.Now dawns the Light; He ranges all his ThoughtsIn square Battalions, bold to meet th' AttacksOf Time and Chance, himself a numerous Host,
All Eye, all Ear, all wakeful as the Day,Firm as a Rock, and moveless as the Centre.In vain the Harlot Pleasure spreads her CharmsTo lull his Thoughts in Luxuries fair LapTo sensual Ease, (the Bane of little Kings,Monarchs whose waxen Images of SoulsAre moulded into Softness) still his MindWears its own Shape, nor can the Heavenly FormStoop to be model'd by the wild DecreesOf the mad Vulgar, that unthinking Herd.He lives above the Crowd, nor hears the NoiseOf Wars and Triumphs, nor regards the ShoutsOf Popular Applause, that empty Sound,Nor feels the flying Arrow of Reproach,Or Spite, or Envy. In himself secure,Wisdom his Tower, and Conscience is his Shield,His Peace all Inward, and his Joys his Own.Now my Ambition swells, my Wishes soar,This be my Kingdom; sit above the Globe
My 'Rising Soul, and dress thy self aroundAnd shine in Virtues Armour; Climb the heightOf Wisdoms lofty Castle, there resideSafe from the Smiling and the Frowning World.Yet once a Day drop down a gentle LookOn the great Molehill, and with pitying EyeSurvey the Busie Emmets round the HeapCrowding and Bustling in a Thousand FormsOf Strife and Toil, to purchase Wealth and Fame,A Bubble or a Dust: Then call thy ThoughtsUp to thy self to feed on Joys unknown,Rich without Gold, and Great without Renown.PART II.

The Bold Stoick.HOnour demands my Song. Forget the GroundMy Generous Muse, and sit amongst the Stars;There sing the Soul, that Conscious of her BirthLives like a Native of the Vital WorldAmongst these dying Clods, and bears her StateJust to her self: How nobly she maintainsHer Character, Superiour to the Flesh,She weilds her Passions like her Limbs, and knowsThe Brutal Powers were only born't obey.This is the Man whom Storms could never makeMeanly complain, nor can a flatt'ring GaleMake him talk proudly: He hath no DesireTo read his Secret Fate; yet unconcern'd
And calm could meet his unborn DestinyIn all its Charming or its Frightful Shapes.He that unshrinking and without a GroanBears the first Wound may finish all the WarWith meer Couragious Silence, and come offConqueror: For the Man that well concealsThe heavy Strokes of Fate he bears 'em well.He, tho' th' Atlantick and the Midland SeasWith adverse Surges meet, and rise on highSuspended 'twixt the Winds, then rush amainMingled with Flames upon his Single HeadAnd Clouds and Stars and Thunder, he would stand▪And from the lofty Castle of his MindSublime look down and Joyfully SurveyThe Ruins of Creation; he aloneHeir of the Dying World: A piercing GlanceShoots upwards from between his closing LidsTo reach his Birth-place, then without a SighHe bids his batter'd Flesh lie gently downAmongst its Native Rubbish; while his Soul
Breaths and flies upward, an undoubted GuestOf the third Heaven, th' unruinable Sky.Thither when Fate has brought Our willing Souls,No matter whether 'twas a Sharp Disease,Or a sharp Sword that help'd the Travellers on,And push'd us to our Home. Bear up my Friend,My ATWOOD, and break thro' the Surging BrineWith steddy Prow; Know, we shall once arriveAt the fair Haven of Eternal BlissTo which we ever steer; whether as KingsOf wide Command we've spread the Spacious SeaWith a broad Painted Fleet, or Row'd alongIn a thin Cockboat with a little Oar.There let my narrow Plank shift me to LandAnd I'll be happy, thus I'll leap AshoreJoyful and fearless on the Immortal Coast,Since all I leave is Mortal, and it must be lost.Free Philosophy.To the much Honoured

How they grow grey in trifling Cares,Or wast the Motions of the SpheresUpon Delights as vain!II.A Puff of Honour fills the Mind,And Yellow Dust is solid Good;Thus like the Ass of Savage KindWe snuff the Breezes of the Wind,Or steal the Serpents Food.Could all the ChoirsThat charm the PolesBut strike one doleful Sound,'Twould be imploy'd to mourn our Souls,Souls that were fram'd of Sprightly FiresIn Floods of Folly drown'd.Souls made of Glory seek a Brutal Joy,How they disclaim their Heavenly Birth,Melt their Bright Substance down with drossy Earth,And hate to be refin'd from that impure Alloy.III.Oft has thy Genius rouz'd us henceWith Elevated Song,
Bid us renounce this World of Sence,Bid us divide th' Immortal PrizeWith the Seraphick Throng:"Knowledge and Love make Spirits blest,"Knowledge their Food and Love their Rest;But Flesh, the unmanageable Beast,Resists the Pity of thine EyesAnd Musick of thy Tongue.Then let the Worms of groveling MindRound the short Joys of Earthy KindIn restless Windings Roam;HOWE hath an ample Orb of Soul,Where shining Worlds of Knowledge roll,Where Love the Center and the PoleCompleats the Heaven at Home.TO

CALL'D,
Advice to a Painter,
Written chiefly against
King WILLIAM III.
Of Glorious Memory.1697.PART I.AND must the Hero that redeem'd our LandHere in the Front of Vice and Scandal stand?The Man of Wondrous Soul, that Scorn'd his EaseTempting the Winters and the faithless Seas,
And paid an Annual Tribute of his LifeTo guard his England from the Irish KnifeAnd crush the French Dragoon? Must WILLIAM's
NameThat brightest Star that gilds the Wings of Fame,WILLIAM the Brave, the Pious, and the JustAdorn these gloomy Scenes of Tyranny and Lust?POLHILL, my Blood's a Fire, my Spirits flame;Vengeance and Darkness on the Poets Name:Why smoak the Skies not? Why no Thunders roll?Nor kindling Lightnings blast his guilty Soul?Audacious Wretch! to stab a Monarch's Fame,And fire his Subjects with a Rebel-Flame,To call the Painter to his Black DesignsTo draw our Guardian's Face in Hellish Lines:Painter beware! the Monarch can be shownUnder no Shape but Angels or his own,GABRIEL or WILLIAM on the Brittish Throne.Oh! could my Thoughts but grasp the vast Design,And Words with Infinite Ideas joyn,
I'de rouse Apelles from his Iron Sleep,And bid him trace the Warriour o're the Deep:Trace him Apelles, o're the Belgian Plain,Fierce, how he climbs the Mountains of the SlainScattering Just Vengeance thro' the Red Campaign.Then dash the Canvas with a flying StrokeTill it be lost in Clouds of Fire and Smoak,And say, 'Twas thus the Conqueror thro' the Squadrons
broke.Mark him again emerging from the CloudFar from his Troops; there like a Rock he stoodHis Countries Single Barrier in a Sea of Blood.Calmly he leaves the Pleasures of a Throne,And his MARIA Weeping; whilst aloneHe wards the Fate of Nations, and provokes his own:But Heav'n secures its Champion; o're the FieldPaint hov'ring Angels; tho' they fly conceal'd,Each intercepts a Death, and wears it on his Shield.Now, noble Pencil; lead him to our Isle,Mark how the Skies with Joyful Lustre smile,
Then imitate the Glory; on the StrandSpread half the Nation longing till he Land.Wash off the Blood, and take a peaceful Teint,All Red the Warriour, White the Ruler paint,Abroad a Hero, and at Home a Saint.Throne him on high upon a shining Seat,Lust and Prophaneness dying at his Feet,While round his Head the Lawrel and the Olive
meet,The Crowns of War and Peace; and may they blowWith Flow'ry Blessings ever on his Brow.At his right Hand pile all the English LawsIn Sacred Volumes; thence the Monarch drawsHis Wise and Just Commands—Rise ye Old Sages of the Brittish Isle,On the fair Tablet cast a reverend SmileAnd bless the Peice; these Statutes are your own,That sway the Cottage, and direct the Throne;People and Prince are one in WILLIAM's Name,Their Joys, their Dangers, and their Laws the same.
Let Liberty and Right with Plumes display'dClap their glad Wings around their Guardian's
Head,Religion o're the rest her Starry Pinions spread.Religion guards him; round the Imperial Queen,Place waiting Vertues, each of Heav'nly Mien;Learn their bright Air, and paint it from his Eyes,The Just, the Bold, the Temperate, and the WiseDwell in his Looks: Majestick, but Serene;Sweet, with no Fondness; Cheerful, but not Vain:Bright without Terror; Great, without Disdain.His Soul inspires us what his Lips command,And spreads his brave Example thro' the Land,Not so the former Reigns;—Bend down his Ear to each afflicted Cry,Let Beams of Grace dart gently from his Eye;But the bright Treasures of his Sacred BreastAre too Divine, too Vast to be exprest,Colours must fail where Words and Numbers faint,And leave the Hero's Heart for Thought alone to
paint.PART II.NOW Muse, pursue the Satyrist again,Wipe off the Blotts of his Invenom'd Pen;Hark, how he bids the Servile Painter drawIn monstrous Shapes the Patrons of our Law;At one slight Dash he cancels every NameFrom the white Rolls of Honesty and Fame:This Scribbling Wretch marks all he meets for Knave,Shoots sudden Bolts promiscuous at the Base and
Brave,And with unpardonable Malice shedsPoison and Spite on undistinguish'd Heads.Painter, forbear; or if thy bolder HandDares to attempt the Villains of the Land,Draw first this Poet, like some baleful StarWith silent Influence shedding Civil War;Or Factious Trumpeter, whose Magick SoundCalls off the Subjects to the Hostile Ground,And scatters Hellish Feuds the Nation Round.
These are the Imps of Hell, that cursed TribeThat first create the Plague, and then the Pain describe.Draw next above, the Great Ones of our Isle,Still from the Good distinguishing the Vile;Seat 'em in Pomp, in Grandeur, and Command,Feeling the Subjects with a greedy Hand:Paint forth the Knaves that have the Nation sold,And tinge their greedy Looks with sordid Gold.Mark what a selfish Faction underminesThe Pious Monarch's generous Designs,Spoil their own Native Land as Vipers do,Vipers that tear their Mothers Bowels thro'.Let great NASSAW beneath a careful CrownMournful in Majesty, look gently down,Mingling soft Pity with an Awful Frown:He grieves to see how long in vain he stroveTo make us blest, how vain his Labours proveTo save the stubborn Land he condescends to Love.TO THE

We rise to see and to be seen,Gaze on the World a while, and thenWe Yawn and Stretch to Sleep again.But FANCY, that uneasie GuestStill holds a Lodging in our Beast;She finds or frames Vexations still,Her self the greatest Plague we feel.We take strange Pleasure in our Pain,And make a Mountain of a Grain,Assume the Load, and pant and sweatBeneath th' Imaginary Weight.With our dear selves we live at strife,While the most constant Scenes of LifeFrom Peevish Humours are not free;Still we affect Variety:Rather than pass an Easie Day,We Fret and Chide the Hours away,Grow weary of this Rolling Sun,And vex that he should ever runThe same old Track; and still, and stillRise red behind yon Eastern Hill,
And chide the Moon that darts her LightThro' the same Casement every Night.We shift our Chambers and our HomesTo dwell where Trouble never comes:Sylvia has left the City Croud,Against the Court exclaims aloud,Flies to the Woods; a Hermit-Saint!She loaths her Patches, Pins, and Paint,Dear Diamonds from her Neck are torn:But HUMOUR, that Eternal ThornSticks in her Heart: She's hurry'd still'Twixt her Wild Passions and her Will:Haunted and hagg'd where're she rovesBy purling Streams, and silent Groves,Or with her Furies, or her Loves.Then our own Native Land we hate,Too Cold, too Windy, or too Wet;Change the thick Climate, and repairTo France or Italy for Air;
In vain we change, in vain we fly;Go Sylvia, mount the Whirling Sky,Or ride upon the Feather'd Wind;In vain; If this Diseased MindClings fast and still sits close behind.Faithful Disease, that never failsAttendance at her Ladies sideOver the Desart or the TideOn rolling Wheels or flying Sails.Happy the Soul that Vertue showsTo fix the place of her Repose,Needless to move; for she can dwellIn her Old Grandsire's Hall as well.VERTUE that never loves to roam,But sweetly hides her self at Home,And easy on a Native ThroneOf humble Turf sits gently down.Yet should Tumultuous Storms ariseAnd mingle Earth and Seas, and Skies,
Should the Waves swell, and make her rollAcross the Line or near the Pole,Still She's at Peace; for well She knowsTo lanch the Stream that Duty shows,And makes her Home wher'ere She goes.Bear her, ye Seas, upon your Breast,Or waft her, Winds, from East to WestOn the soft Air; She cannot findA Couch so easie as her Mind,Nor breathe a Climate half so kind.TO

While Hope and Fear are in a doubtful StrifeWhether this Opera of LifeBe acted well to gain the Plaudit of my God.IV.There's a Day hastning, ('tis an Awful Day)When the great Sovereign shall at large reviewAll that we speak and all we do,The several Parts we act on this wide Stage of Clay:These he approves, and those he blames,And Crowns perhaps a Porter, and a Prince he DamnsO if the Judge from his tremendous SeatShall not condemn what I have done,I shall be Happy tho' unknown,Nor need the gazing Rabble, nor the shouting Street.V.I hate the Glory, Friend, that springsFrom Vulgar Breath and empty Sound;Fame mounts her upward with a Flatt'ring GaleUpon her Airy WingsTill Envy Shoots, and Fame receives the Wound;Then her flagging Pinions fail,
Down Glory falls and strikes the GroundAnd breaks her batter'd Limbs.Rather let me be quite conceal'd from Fame;How happy I should lyeIn Sweet Obscurity,Nor the Loud World pronounce my little Name!Here I could live and dye alone;Or if Society be dueTo keep our Tast of Pleasure new,GVNSTON, I'de live and die with you,For both our Souls are one.VI.Here we could sit and pass the pleasing Hour,And Pity Kingdoms and their Kings,And smile at all their shining Things,Their Toys of State, and Images of Power;Vertue should dwell within our Seat,Vertue alone could make it sweet,Nor is her self secure but in a close Retreat.While she withdraws from publick PraiseEnvy perhaps would cease to rail,Envy it self may innocently gazeAt Beauty in a Vail.But if she once advance to Light,Her Charms are lost in Envy's Sight,And Vertue is the Mark of Universal Spight.TO

Young HARTOPP knows this Noble Theme,That the wild Scenes of Busie Life,The Noise, th' Amusements, and the StrifeAre but the Visions of the Night,Gay Phantoms of delusive Light,Or a Vexatious Dream.II.Flesh is the vilest and the leastIngredient of our Frame,We're born to live above the Beast,Or quit the Manly Name:Pleasures of Sence we leave for Boys,Be shining Dust the Miser's Food,Let Fancy feed on Fame and Noise;Souls must pursue Diviner Joys,And seize th' Immortal Good.EPISTOLA.

Funeral POEM
ON
Thomas GunstonEsqPresented to
The Right Honourable
The Lady ABNEY
Lady Mayoress of London.July 1701.MADAM,HAD I been a common Mourner at the Funeral of
the Dear Gentleman deceased, I should have
labour'd after more of Art in the following
Composition to supply the defect of Nature and to feign

a Sorrow; but the uncommon Condescension of his
Friendship to Me, the Inward Esteem I pay his Memory,
and the vast and tender Sence I have of our
Loss make all the Methods of Art needless, whilst natural
Grief supplies more than all.I had resolv'd indeed to lament in Sighs and Silence,
and frequently check'd the forward Muse when she
brought me Grief in Numbers, and urg'd me to a tuneful
Mourning; but the Importunity was not to be resisted:
Long Lines of Sorrow flow'd in upon my Fancy
'ere I was aware, whilst I took many a Solitary Walk
in the Garden adjoyning to his Seat at Newington:
Nor could I free my self from the Melancholy Idea's
that crowded themselves upon me, and your Ladyship
will find throughout the Poem that the fair and unfinish'd
Building which he had just raised for himself
gave almost all the turns of Mourning to my Thoughts,
for I pursue no other Topicks of Elegy then what my
Passion and my Senses led me to.The Poem roves as my Eyes and Thoughts did, from
one part of the Fabrick to the other: It rises from the
Foundation, salutes the Walls, the Doors, and the
Windows, drops a Tear upon the Roof, and climbs the
Turret that dear Retreat, where I promis'd my self
many sweet Hours of his Conversation; there my Song
wanders amongst the delightful Subjects Divine and
Moral which used to Entertain our happy leisure, and
thence flings her self down to the Fields and the Shady
Walks where I so often injoy'd his pleasing Discourse,
and my Sorrows diffuse themselves there without a limit:

I had quite forgotten what I was writing, till I correct
my self and rise to the Turret again to lament that Desolate
Seat, and how vainly shines the Golden Ball
that Crowns it: Thus I have written without rule and
with a negligence becoming Woe unfeigned.Had I design'd a compleat Elegy on your Dearest
Brother and intended it for publick View, I should
have followed the usual Forms of Poetry, spent whole
Pages in the Character and Praises of the Deceased,
and thence took occasion to call Mankind to Complain
aloud of the Universal and Unspeakable Loss: But I
wrote meerly for my self as a Friend of the Dead and
to ease my full Soul by breathing out my own Complaint:
I knew his Character and Vertues so well that
there was no need to mention 'em while I talk'd only
with my self, for the Image of them was ever present
with me, which kept my Sorrow lively and my Tears
flowing with my Numbers.Perhaps your Ladyship will expect some Divine
Thoughts and Sacred Meditations mingled with a Subject
so solemn as this is: Had I form'd a Design of
offering it to your Hands I had compos'd a more Christian
Poem: But 'twas Grief purely natural for a Death
so surprizing that drew all the Lines of it, and therefore
my highest Reflections are but of a Moral Strain;
Such as it is, your Ladyship requires a Copy of it, but
let it not touch your Soul too tenderly, nor renew your
own Mournings. Receive it, Madam, as a Sacrifice
of Love and Tears offer'd at the Tomb of a Departed
Friend, and let it abide with you as a Witness of that

Affectionate Respect and Honour that I bore him, all
which as your Ladyships most rightful Due both by Merit
and Succession, is now humbly offered byMADAM,Your Ladyships most Hearty
and Obedient Servant,
I. Watts.TO THE
Dear Memory of my Honoured Friend
Thomas GunstonEsq Who Died November 11. 1700. When he had just Finish't his Seat at
NEWINGTON.OF blasted Hopes and of short withering JoysSing Heavenly Muse. Try thine Ethereal
VoiceIn Funeral Numbers and a doleful Song;GUNSTON the Just, the Generous, and the Young,GUNSTON the Friend is dead. O Empty NameOf Earthly Bliss! 'Tis all an Airy Dream,All a Vain Thought! Our Soaring Fancies riseOn treacherous Wings; and Hopes that touch the
Skies
Drag but a longer Ruine thro' the downward Air,And plunge the falling Joy but deeper in Despair.How did our Souls stand flatter'd and prepar'dTo shout him welcome to the Seat he rear'd!There the Dear Man should see his Hopes Compleat,Smiling and tasting every lawful SweetThat Peace and Plenty brings, while numerous YearsRoll'd happy Circles round the Joyful Spheres:Revolving Suns should still renew his strength,And draw th' uncommon Thread to an unusual
Length.But hasty Fate thrusts her dread Shears between,Cuts the Young Life off, and shuts up the Scene▪Thus Airy Pleasure dances in our SightAnd spreads fair Images of Gay DelightT' allure our Souls, till just within our ArmsThe Vision dies, and all the painted CharmsFlee quick away from the pursuing Sight,Till they are lost in Shades, and mingle with the
Night.
Muse, stretch thy Wings and thy sad Journey bendTo the fair The House. Fabrick that thy Dying FriendBuilt Nameless: 'Twill suggest a thousand thingsMournful and Soft as my Urania Sings.How did he lay the deep The Foundations. Foundations strong,Marking the Bounds, and rear the The Walls. Walls alongSolid and Lasting; there a numerous TrainOf Happy GUNSTON's might in Pleasure reignWhile Nations perish and long Ages run,Nations unborn, and Ages unbegun:Not Time it self should waste the Blest Estate,Nor the Tenth Race rebuild the Ancient Seat:How fond our Fancies are! The Founder DiesChildless: His Sisters weep, and close his Eyes,And wait upon his Herse with never-ceasing Cries.Lofty and Slow it moves unto the Tomb,While weighty Sorrow nods on every Plume;
A Thousand Groans his dear Remains conveyTo his cold Lodging in a Bed of Clay,His Countries Sacred Tears well-watering all the
Way.See the dull Wheels roll on the Sable Load,But no dear Son to tread the Mournful Road,And fondly kind drop his young Sorrows there,The Father's Urn bedewing with a Filial Tear.O had he left us One behind to playWanton about the Painted The Hall. Hall, and say"This was my Father's, with Impatient JoyIn my fond Arms I'de clasp't the Smiling Boy,And call'd him my Young Friend: But Awful FateDesign'd the mighty Stroke as lasting as 'twas great.And must this Building then, this costly FrameStand here for Strangers? Must some unknown
NamePossess these The Rooms. Rooms, the Labours of my Friend?Why were these Walls rais'd for this hapless End?
Why these Apartments all adorn'd so Gay?Why his rich Fancy lavish't thus away?Muse, view the The Paintings. Paintings, how the hovering LightPlays o're the Colours in a wanton Flight,And mingled Shades wrought in by soft DegreesGive a sweet Foyl to all the Charming Piece;But Night, Eternal Night hangs black aroundThe dismal Chambers of the hollow Ground,And Solid Shades unmingled round his BedStand Hideous: Earthy Fogs embrace his Head,And noysom Vapours glide along his FaceRising perpetual. Muse, forsake the place,Flee the raw Damps of the unwholsome Clay,Look to his Airy spacious Hall, and sayHow has he chang'd it for a loathsome Cave,Confin'd and Crowded in a narrow Grave!Th' Unhappy House looks desolate and mourns,And every The Doors. Door groans doleful as it turns;The Pillars languish, and each lofty WallStately in Grief, laments the Master's Fall
In drops of Briny Dew; the Fabrick bearsHis faint Resemblance and renews my Tears.Solid and square it rises from below;A Noble Air without a Gaudy ShowReigns thro' the Model, and adorns the Whole,Manly and Plain just like the Builders Soul.O how I love to view the Stately Frame,That dear Memorial of the best-lov'd Name!Then could I wish for some prodigious CaveVast as his Seat, and silent as his Grave,Where the tall Shades stretch to the hideous Roof,Forbid the Day, and guard the Sun-beams off;Thither, my willing Feet, shou'd ye be drawnAt the gray Twilight, and the early Dawn;There sweetly sad shou'd my soft Minutes roll,Numbring the Sorrows of my drooping Soul.But these are Airy Thoughts! Substantial GriefGrows by those Objects that should yield Relief;Fond of my Woes I heave my Eyes around,My Grief from every Prospect courts a Wound;
Views the green Gardens, views the Smiling Skies,Still my Heart sinks, and still my Cares arise;My wandring Feet round the dear Mansion rove,And there to sooth my Sorrows I indulge my Love.Oft have I laid the Awful Calvin by,And the sweet Cowley, with Impatient EyeTo see those Walls, pay the sad Visit there,And drop the Tribute of an hourly Tear:Still I behold some Melancholy Scene,With many a Pensive Thought, and many a Sigh
between.Two Days ago we took the Evening Air,I, and my Grief, and my Urania there;Say, my Urania, how the Western SunBroke from Black Clouds, and in full Glory shoneGilding the Roof, then dropt into the Sea,And sudden Night devour'd the sweet remains of DayThus the dear Youth just rear'd his shining HeadFrom Obscure Shades of Life, and sunk among 
Dead.
The rising Sun adorn'd with all his LightSmiles on these Walls again: But endless NightReigns uncontroul'd where the dear GUNSTON
lies,He's set for ever, and must never rise.Then why these Beams, Unseasonable Star,These lightsome Smiles descending from afarTo greet a Mourning House? In vain the DayBreaks thro' the The Windows. Windows with a joyful Ray,And marks a shining Path along the FloorsBounding the Evening and the Morning Hours;In vain it bounds 'em: While vast EmptinessAnd hollow Silence reigns thro' all the Place,Nor heeds the cheerful change of Nature's Face.Yet Natures Wheels will on without controul,The Sun will rise, the tuneful Spheres will roll,And the two Nightly Bears walk round and watch
the Pole.See while I spèak, high on her Sable WheelOld Night comes rolling up the Eastern Hill:
Troops of dark Clouds prepare her way; behold,How their brown Pinions Edg'd with Evening GoldSpread Shaddowing o're the House, and glide awaySlowly pursuing the declining Day;O're the broad The Roof. Roof they fly their Circuit still,Thus Days before they did, and Days to come they
will;But the Black Cloud that Shaddows o're his EyesHangs there immoveable, and never flies:Fain would I bid the Envious Gloom be gone,Ah fruitless Wish! how are his Curtains drawnFor a long Evening that despairs the Dawn!Muse, view the The Turret. Turret: Just beneath the SkiesLonesome it stands, and fixes both mine EyesAs it would ask a Tear. O Sacred Seat,Sacred to Friendship! O Divine Retreat!Here did I hope my happy Hours t' employ,And fed beforehand on the promis'd Joy,When weary of the noisy Town, my FriendFrom Mortal Cares retiring shou'd ascend
And lead me thither. We Our Conversation there. alone wou'd sit,Free and secure of all Intruding Feet:Our Thoughts shou'd stretch their longest Wings
and rise,Nor bound their Soarings by the lower Skies:Our Tongues shou'd aim at everlasting Themes,And speak what Mortals dare, of all the NamesOf Boundless Joys and Glories, Thrones, and SeatsBuilt high in Heaven for Souls: We'd trace the StreetsOf Golden Pavement, walk each happy Field,And climb and tast the Fruits the spicy Mountains
yield:Then would we swear to keep the Sacred Road,And walk right upwards to the blest Abode:We'd charge our parting Spirits there to meet,There Hand in Hand approach th' Almighty's Seat'And bend our Heads adoring at our Maker's Feet.Thus should we mount on bold adventrous Wings,In high Discourse, and dwell on Heavenly things,
While the pleas'd Hours in sweet Succession move,And Minutes measur'd as they are aboveBy ever-circling Joys, and ever-shining Love.Anon our Thoughts should lower their lofty
Flight,Sink by degrees, and take a pleasing SightA large round Prospect of the spreading Plain,The Wealthy River, and his Winding Train,The Smoaky City, and the Busie Men.How we should smile to see degenerate WormsLavish their Lives, and fight for Airy FormsOf Painted Honour, Dreams of empty sound,Till Envy rise, and shoot a secret WoundAt swelling Glory; strait the Bubble breaks,And the Scenes vanish as the Man awakes:Then the tall Titles Insolent and ProudSink to the Dust, and mingle with the Crowd.Man is a restless Thing: Still vain and wild,Lives beyond Sixty, nor outgrows the Child:His hurrying Lusts still break the Sacred Bound,
To seek new Pleasures on forbidden Ground,And buy them all too dear. Unthinking Fool,For a short dying Joy to sell a Deathless Soul!'Tis but a Grain of Sweetness they can Sow,And reap the long sad Harvest of Immortal Woe.Another Tribe toyl in a different Strife,And banish all the lawful Sweets of LifeTo sweat and dig for Gold, to hoard the Oar,Hide the dear Dust yet darker than before,And never dare to use a Grain of all the Store.Happy the Man that knows the Value justOf Earthly Things, nor is enslav'd to Dust.'Tis a rich Gift the Skies but rarely sendTo Fav'rite Souls. Then happy thou, my Friend,For thou hadst learnt to Manage and CommandThe Wealth that Heaven bestow'd with Liberal
Hand:Hence this fair Structure rose; and hence this SeatMade to invite my not unwilling Feet;In vain 'twas made! for We shall never meet,
And Smile, and Love, and Bless each other here,The Envious Tomb forbids thy Face t' appear,Detains thee GVNSTON from my longing Eyes,And all my hopes lie buried where my GVNSTON
lies.Come hither all ye tenderest Souls that knowThe heights of Fondness and the depths of Woe,Young Mothers, who your darling Babes have foundUntimely Murd'red with a ghastly Wound;Ye frighted Nymphs, who on the Bridal Bed,Claspt in your Arms your Lovers Cold and Dead,Come; in the Pomp of all your wild DespairWith flowing Eyelids and disorder'd Hair,Death in your Looks; come mingle Grief with me,And drown your little Streams in my unbounded Sea.You Sacred Mourners of a Nobler MouldBorn for a Friend, whose dear Embraces holdBeyond all Natures Ties; you that have knownTwo happy Souls made intimately One,
And felt a parting Stroke, 'tis you must tellThe Smart, the Twinges, and the Racks I feel:This Soul of mine that dreadsul Wound has born,Off from its Side its dearest Half is torn,The Rest lies bleeding, and but lives to mourn.Oh Infinite Distress! Such raging GriefShou'd command Pity, and despair Relief.Passion methinks should rise from all my Groans,Give Sense to Rocks, and Sympathy to Stones.Ye dusky The adjacent Country. Woods and ecchoing Hills aroundRepeat my Cries with a perpetual Sound:Be all ye flowry Vales with Thorns o'regrown,Assist my Sorrows, and declare your own,Alas! your Lord is dead. The humble PlainMust ne're receive his Courteous Feet again:Mourn ye gay smiling Meadows, and be seenIn Wintry Robes instead of Youthful Green:And bid the The Brook. Brook that still runs warbling byMove silent on, and weep his useless Channel dry.
Hither methinks the lowing Herds shou'd come,And moaning Turtles murmur o're his Tomb:The Oak shou'd wither, and the curling The Trees. VineWeep his Young Life out, while his Arms untwineTheir Amorous Folds, and mix his Bleeding Soul
with mine.Ye stately Elms in your long Order mourn,Strip off your Pride to dress your Master's Urn:Here gently drop your Leaves instead of Tears;Ye Elms, the Reverend Growth of Ancient Years,Stand tall and naked to the Blustring RageOf the mad Winds; thus it becomes your AgeTo show your Sorrows. Often ye have seenOur Heads reclin'd upon the rising Green;Beneath your Sacred Shade diffus'd we lay,Here Friendship reign'd with an unbounded sway:Hither our Souls their constant Off'rings brought,The Burthens of the Breast, and Labours of the
Thought;Our opening Bosoms on the Conscious GroundSpread all the Sorrows, all the Joys we found,
And mingled every Care; nor was it knownWhich of the Pains or Pleasures were our own;Then with an equal Hand and honest SoulWe share the Heap; yet both possess the Whole,And all the Passions there thro' both our Bosoms roll.By turns We Comfort, and by turns Complain,And Bear and Ease by turns the Sympathy of Pain.Friendship! Mysterious Thing, what Magick PowersSupport thy Sway, and charm these Minds of ours?Bound to thy Foot we boast our Birth-right still,And dream of Freedom when we've lost our Will,And chang'd away our Souls: At thy CommandWe snatch new Miseries from a Foreign HandTo call them ours, and thoughtless of our EasePlague the dear Self that we were born to please.Thou Tyranness of Minds, whose Cruel ThroneHeaps on poor Mortals Sorrows not their own;As tho' our Mother Nature cou'd no moreFind Woes sufficient for each Son she bore,Friendship divides the Shares, and lengthens out
the Store.
Yet are we fond of thine Imperious Reign,Proud of the Slavery, wanton in our Pain,And chide the courteous Hand when Death dissolves
the Chain.Vertue, forgive the Thought! The raving MuseWild and despairing knows not what she does,Grows mad in Grief, and in her Savage HoursAffronts the Name she Loves and she adores.She is thy Votaress too; and at thy ShrineO Sacred Friendship! offer'd Songs DivineWhile GUNSTON liv'd, and both our Souls
were thine.Here to these Shades at solemn Hours we cameTo pay Devotion with a mutual Flame,And roll'd in Pleasures, while the Evening BreezeFann'd the Leaves gently, sporting thro' the Trees,And the declining Sun with sloping WheelsRoll'd down the Golden Day behind the Western
Hills.Mourn ye young The Gardens. Gardens, ye unfinish't Gates,Ye Green Inclosures and ye growing Sweets,Lament, for ye our Midnight Hours have known,And watch'd us walking by the silent MoonIn Conference Divine, while Heavenly FireKindling our Breasts did all our Thoughts inspireWith Joys almost Immortal; then our ZealBlaz'd and burnt high to reach th' Ethereal Hill,And Love refin'd like that above the PolesThrew both our Arms round one anothers SoulsIn Rapture and Embraces. Oh forbear,Forbear, my Song! this is too much to hear,Too dreadful to repeat; such Joys as theseFled from the Earth for ever!Oh for a general Grief! let all things shareOur Woes that knew our Loves. The Neighbouring
The Air. AirLet it be laden with Immortal Sighs,And tell the Gales, that every Breath that flies
Over these Fields shou'd murmur and complain,And kiss the fading Grass, and propagate the Pain▪Weep all ye Buildings, and ye The Groves. Groves aroundFor ever Weep, This is an endless WoundVast and Incurable. Ye Buildings knewHis Silver Tongue, ye Groves have heard it too:At that dear Sound no more shall ye rejoyce,And I no more must hear the Charming Voice,Wo to my drooping Soul! that Heavenly BreathThat could speak Life lies now congeal'd in Death;While on his folded Lips all Cold and PaleEternal Chains and heavy silence dwell.Yet my fond Hope would hear him speak again;Once more at least, one gentle Word; and thenGUNSTON aloud I call: In vain I cryGUNSTON aloud; for he must ne're reply.In vain I mourn, and drop these Funeral Tears,Death and the Grave have neither Eyes nor Ears:
Wandring I tune my Sorrows to the Groves,And vent my swelling Griefs, and tell the Winds our
Loves;While the dear Youth Sleeps fast and hears 'em not;He has forgot me: In the lonesome VaultMindless of WATTS and Friendship there he liesDeaf and Unthinking Clay.But whither am I led? This Artless GriefHurries the Muse on obstinate and deafTo all the nicer Rules, and bears her downFrom the tall Fabrick to the Neighbouring Ground:The pleasing Hours and the dear Moments pastIn these sweet Fields reviving on my TastSnatch me away resistless with Impetuous hast.Spread thy strong Pinions once again my Song,And reach the The Turret. Turret thou hast left so long:O're the wide Roof its lofty Head it rears,Waiting for our Converse; but only hearsThe noisie Tumults of the Realms on high;The Winds salute it Whistling as they fly,
Or jarring round the Windows; Rattling ShowersLash the fair Sides, above loud Thunder roars,But still the Master Sleeps; nor hears the VoiceOf Sacred Friendship, nor the Tempests noise:An Iron Slumber sits on every Sence,In vain the Heavenly Thunders strice to rouze it
thence.One Labour more, my Muse, the Golden The Golden Ball. SphereSeems to demand: See thro' the Dusky AirDownward it shines upon the rising Moon,And as she labours up to reach her Noon,The Ball pursues her Orb with streaming Light,And shoots a Golden Dày on the Pale Queen of
Night:But not one Beam can reach the darksome Grave,Or pierce the solid Gloom that fills the CaveWhere GUNSTON dwells in Death. My waking
EyesSaw the last Midnight reigning o're the Skies,
And Old Bootes drove his shining CarrThro' the Midheaven: Behold the Glittering SphereBright as a Burning Meteor born on high,Or some new Comet glaing thro' the SkyIt flam'd and mingled with the larger Stars;In vain (said I) the Golden Comet Glares,In vain it stands; while with a dismal FallHe sunk beneath the Ground that rais'd the Lofty
Ball.Now let me call the Joyful Day to mind;'Twas a fair Morning; and the Blustring WindSlept in its peaceful Caverns, while he cameGazing and pleas'd to see the Noble FrameCrown'd with that shining Orb. "Stand there, he
cries,"Thou little Emblem of the boundless Skies"Whither my Soul with fiery Passion tends;The Emblem stands; and tells surviving FriendsOf the bright Palace and the Golden ThroneWhere the Dear GUNSTON's better part is
gone:
His eager Thoughts bent on their shining wayLet the Clay drop to mingle with the Clay;But his great Soul beyond the Stars is fled:Then why, my Heart, why should we Mourn him
Dead?Strangely, my Thoughts, ye let this cozening GriefWith a false Name impose on your Belief:It saw the Flesh sink down with closing EyesTo the cold Earth, and cry'd, 'tis GUNSTON
Dies:Mistaken Grief! to call the Flesh the Friend!The Heavenly Court saw the Bright Youth ascend,Flew to embrace him with Immortal Love,And sung his Welcome to the Seats above.The Building firm, and all the Mansions bright,The Roof high-Vaulted with Aethereal Light:Beauty and Strength on the tall Bulwarks SateIn Heavenly Diamond: And for every GateOn Golden Hinges a broad Ruby turns,Guards off the Foe, and as it moves it burns.Millions of Glories Reign thro' every part;Infinite Power and Uncreated Art
Stand here display'd, and to the Stranger showHow it out-shines the Noblest Seats below;The Stranger just look'd down, and Smil'd upon
'em too.Come, my Urania, leave the doleful Strain,Let Heavenly Notes resume their Joys again;In Everlasting Numbers sing, and say,"GUNSTON the Friend lives still, and wipe
our Tears away.AN
ELEGY
ON THE
Reverend Mr. Tho. Gouge.TO
Mr. Arthur Shallett Merchant.Worthy SIR,THE Subject of the following Elegy was high
in your Esteem and enjoy'd a large share of
your Affections. Scarce doth his Memory need
the Assistance of the Muse to make it perpetual,

But when She can at once pay her Honours to the
Venerable Dead, and by this Address acknowledge the
Favours She has received from the Living, 'tis a double
Pleasure toSIR,Your obliged humble Servant,TO THE
MEMORY
OF THE
Reverend Mr. Tho. Gouge,
Who Died January 8. 1699/1700.I.YE Virgin Souls, whose Sweet ComplaintCould teach Psalm Cxxxvii.Euphrates not to flow,Could Lam: 1. 2, 3.Sion's Ruine so Divinely PaintArray'd in Beauty and in Woe;Awake, ye Virgin Souls, to mourn,And with your Tuneful Sorrows dress a Prophet's
Urn.
O could my Lips, or Flowing EyesBut imitate such Charming Grief,I'de teach the Seas, and teach the SkiesWailings, and Sobs, and Sympathies,Nor should the Stones, or Rocks be deaf;Rocks shall have Eyes, and Stones have Ears,While GOUGE's Death is Mourn'd in Melody
and Tears.II.Heaven was impatient of our Crimes,And sent his Minister of DeathTo Scourge the bold Rebellion of the Times,And to demand our Prophet's Breath;He came commission'd for the FatesOf Awful MEAD, and Charming BATES,There he essay'd the Vengeance first,Then took a dismal Aim and brought great GOUGE
to Dust.III.Great GOUGE to Dust! How Doleful is the
Sound?How vast the Stroke is? And how wide the Wound?
Yes, 'tis a vast uncommon Death,Yes, 'tis a Wound unmeasurably wide;No Vulgar Mortal Dy'dWhen he resign'd his Breath.The Muse that Mourns a Nations FallShou'd wait at GOVGE's Funeral,Should mingle Majesty and GroansSuch as she Sings to sinking Thrones,And in deep-sounding Numbers tellHow Sion trembled when this Pillar fell.Sion grows Weak, and England Poor,Nature her self with all her StoreCan furnish such a Pomp for Death no more.IV.The Reverend Man let all things mourn;Sure he was some Aethereal Mind,Fated in Flesh to be confin'd,And order'd to be Born.His Soul was of th' Angelick frame,The same Ingredients, and the Mould the same,When the Creator makes a Minister of Flame;
He was all form'd of Heavenly Things,Mortals, believe what my Urania Sings,For she has seen him rise upon his Flamy Wings.V.How would he mount, how would he fly,Up thro' the Ocean of the SkyTow'rd the Coelestial Coast!With what amazing swiftness soarTill Earth's dark Ball was seen no moreAnd all its Mountains lost.Scarce could the Muse pursue him with her Sight,But, Angels, you can tell,For oft you met his Wondrous Flight,And knew the Stranger well;Say, how he past the radiant SpheresAnd visited your happy Seats,And trac'd the well known Turnings of the Golden
Streets,And walk'd among the Stars.VI.Tell how he climb'd the Everlasting HillsSurveying all the Realms above,
Born on a Strong-wing'd Faith, and on the Fiery
WheelsOf an Immortal Love.'Twas there he took a glorious SightOf the Inheritance of Saints in Light,And read their Title in their Saviour's Right.How oft the humble Scholar came,And to your Songs he rais'd his EarsTo learn the Unutterable Name,To view the Eternal Base that bearsThe New Creations Frame.The Countenance of God he sawFull of Mercy, full of Awe,The Glories of his Power, and Glories of his
Grace:There he beheld the Wondrous SpringsOf those Eternal Sacred ThingsThe Peaceful Gospel and the Fiery LawIn that Majestic Face.That Face that all his Gazing Powers employWith most profound Abasement and exalted Joy.
The Rolls of Fate were half unseal'd,He stood adoring by;The Volumes open'd to his Eye,And sweet Intelligence he heldWith all his shining Kindred of the Sky.VII.Ye Seraphs that surround the Throne,Tell how his Name was thro' the Pallace known,How warm his Zeal was, and how like your own:Speak it aloud, let half the Nation hear,And bold Blasphemers shrink and fear:Impudent Tongues, to blast a Prophet's Name!The Poison sure was fetch'd from HellWhere the old Blasphemers dwell,To taint the purest Dust, and blot the whitest
Fame.Impudent Tongues! You should be darted thro',Nail'd to your own Black Mouths, and lieUseless and Dead till Slander die,Till Slander die with you.VIII."We saw him, say th' Ethereal Throng,"We saw his warm Devotions rise,"We heard the fervour of his Cries,"And mixt his Praises with our Song:"We knew the secret Flights of his retiring Hours,"Nightly he wak'd his inward Powers,"Young Israel rose to Wrestle with his God,"And with unconquer'd Force scal'd the Coelestial
Towers"To reach the Blessing down for those that sought
his Blood."Oft we beheld the Thunderer's Hand"Rais'd high to crush the Factious Foe;"As oft we saw the rolling Vengeance stand"Doubtful t' obey the dread Command,"While his ascending Pray'r witheld the falling
Blow.IX.Draw the past Scenes of thy DelightMy Muse, and bring the Wondrous Man to Sight.
Place him surrounded as he stoodWith Pious Crowds, while from his TongueA Stream of Harmony ran soft along,And every Ear drank in the flowing Good:Softly it ran its Silver Way,Till warm Devotion rais'd the Current strong;Then fervid Zeal on the sweet Deluge rode,Life, Love, and Glory, Grace, and JoyDivinely roll'd promiscuous on the Torrent-Flood,And bore our Raptur'd Sense away, and Thoughts
and Souls to God.O might we dwell for ever there!No more return to breath this grosser Air,This Atmosphere of Sin, Calamity, and Care.X.But Heavenly Scenes soon leave the SightWhile we belong to Clay,Passions of Terror and DelightDemand alternate Sway.Behold the Man whose awful VoiceCould well proclaim the Fiery Law,
Kindle the Flames that Moses saw,And swell the Trumpets Warlike noise.He stands, the Herald of the Threatning Skies,Lo, on his Reverend Brow the Frowns Divinely
rise,All Sinai's Thunder on his Tongue, and Lightning
in his Eyes.Round the high Roof the Cursès flewDistinguishing each guilty Head,Far from th' unequal War the Atheist fled,His Kindled Arrows still pursue,His Arrows strike the Atheist thro',And fix him down to Dread.The Marble Heart groans with an inward Wound:Blaspheming Souls of harden'd SteelShriek out amaz'd at the new Pangs they feel,And dread the Eccho's of the Sound.The Lofty Wretch Arm'd and Array'dIn gaudy Pride sinks down his Impious Head,Plunges in dark Despair, and mingles with the Dead.XI.Now Muse assume a softer Strain,Now sooth the Sinners Raging Smart,Borrow of GOVGE the wondrous ArtTo calm the Surging Conscience, and asswage the
Pain.He from a Bleeding God derivesLife for the Souls that Guilt had slain,And strait the dying Rebel lives,The Dead arise again.The opening Skies almost obeyHis powerful Song, a Heavenly RayAwakes Despair to Light, and sheds a cheerful Day.His wondrous Voice rolls back the Spheres,Recalls the Scenes of Ancient YearsTo make the Saviour known;Sweetly the flying Charmer rovesThro' all his Labours and his Loves,The Anguish of his Cross, and Triumphs of his
Throne.XII.Hark, he invites our Feet to tryThe steep ascent of Calvary,And sets the fatal Tree before our Eye:See here Coelestial Sorrow reigns;Rude Nails and ragged Thorns lay byTing'd with the Crimson of Redeeming Veins.In wondrous Words he sung the Vital FloodWhere all our Sins were drown'd,Words fit to heal and fit to wound,Sharp as the Spear, and Balmy as the Blood.In his Discourse DivineAfresh the Purple Fountain flow'd,Our falling Tears kept Sympathetick TimeAnd trickled to the Ground,While every Accent gave a doleful Sound,Sad as the breaking Heart-strings of th' Expiring
God.XIII.Down to the Mansions of the DeadWith trembling Joy our Souls are lead,The Captives of his Tongue;
There the dear Prince of Light reclines his HeadDarkness and Shades among.With pleasing Horror we surveyThe Caverns of the Tomb,Where the Belov'd Redeemer layAnd shed a sweet Persume.Hark, the Old Earthquake roars againIn GOUGE's Voice, and breaks the ChainOf heavy Death, and tears the Tombs;The Rising God! he comes, he comes,With Throngs of waking Saints, a long triumphing
Train.XIV.See the bright Squadrons of the Sky,Downward on Wings of Joy and Hast they fly,Meet their returning Sovereign and attend him high.A shining Carr the Conqueror fillsForm'd of a Golden Cloud;Slowly the Pomp rolls up the Azure Hills,Old Satan foams and yells aloud,And gnaws th' Eternal Brass that binds him to the
Wheels.
The opening Gates of Bliss receive their King,The Father-God Smiles on his Son,Pays him the Honours he has won,The lofty Thrones adore, and little Cherubs Sing.Behold him on his Native Throne,Glory sits fast upon his Head;Dress't in new Light and Beamy RobesHis Hand rolls on the Seasons and the shining
Globes,And sways the living Worlds and Regions of the
Dead.XV.GOUGE was his Envoy to this Realm below,Vast was the Trust, and great his Skill,Bright the Credentials he could show,And Thousands own'd the Seal.His Hallowed Lips could well impartThe Grace, the Promise, and Command:He knew the Pity of EMMANUEL's Heart,And Terrors of JEHOVAH's Hand.How did our Souls start out to hearThe Embassies of Love he bore,
While every Ear in Rapture hungUpon the Charming Wonders of his Tongue.Lifes busie Cares a Sacred Silence bound,Attention stood with all her Powers,With fixed Eyes and Awe profound,Chain'd to the Pleasure of the Sound,Nor knew the flying Hours.XVI.But Oh! my everlasting Grief!Heaven has recall'd his Envoy from our Eyes,Hence Deluges of Sorrow rise,Nor hope th' Impossible Relief.Ye Remnants of the Sacred TribeWho feel the Loss, come share the Smart,And mix your Groans with mine:Where is the Tongue that can describeInfinite Things with Equal Art,Or Language so Divine?Our Passions want the Heavenly Flame,Almighty Love Breaths faintly in our Songs,And Awful Threatnings languish on our Tongues;HOWE is a Great, but single Name.
Amidst the Crowd he stands alone;Stands yet, but with his Starry Pinions on,Dress't for the Flight and ready to be gone:Eternal God, command his Stay,Stretch the dear Months of his Delay;O we could wish his Age were one Immortal Day!But when the Flaming Chariot's comeAnd shining Guards t' attend thy Prophet Home,Amidst a thousand Weeping EyesSend an Elisha down, a Soul of Equal Size,Or burn the Worthless Globe, and take us to the
Skies.AN
