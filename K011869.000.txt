And pray, what are you about, Neddy Nimblewrist?Ned.Twisting whipcord and wire—to give you a red waistcoat.Dar.Whipcord and wire. Oh, dear—well if I must be whipp'd—If I don't like it, you shall leave off.Pat.Pray, Sir, what's his crime?Adj.Only suspicion of drunkenness, and sleeping on his post.Dar.Yes, sleeping on my post—but I never dreamt that I should be flogg'd for it.Pat.Who is your Captain?Adj.At present, Sir; we have no Captain, he that was our captain was preferr'd prior to the review, and our new one is not arrived yet from Berlin.Pat.Yes, Sir, but he is arrived, and honour'd with his Majesty's commission. I am he.Dar.Captain Pat—Patty—yes it is, did I not say I should see Captain Patty?Pat.Adjutant—I think this business may be deferr'd.Adj.Why, Sir, we had not the honor to knew of your arrival—and, Sir, to oblige you, we'll postpone his punishment.Cap.By all means.Dar.By all means—Postpone, ay and pardon it too—the devil a bit of hurt will it do to any body.Adj.Release him.Dar.Ay release me—don't you hear, my dear friends—pot-companions, brother messmates, and brother soldiers, Neddy Nimblewrist, and Tommy Tickleback—I am not for the red waistcoat—so you may go and find another mouse for your cat o-nine-tails. Get out, get along. Ah, ha!Exeunt soldiers and drummers.Adj.And if you please, Sir, I'll go and inform the Marshal of your arrival—Sir, you are welcome to out corps—I am very glad to see you.Exit.Dar.Yes, Sir, I am very glad to see you—but my dear Pat, how you came like my good guardian angel, to save me!—let me see—arn't you an angel?Looking round with pleasure and taking hold of his hand.Pat.But how is all this, Darby?—you ingenious rogue you, how did you bring all this about?—I left you at the plow tail in Ireland—and here I find you at the whipping post in Silesia.Dar.Ay, 'twas you that did it—for when Captain Fitzroy made you a present of the colours, it set me all agog for a General's staff—and when that jade Kathleen jilted me.Pat.Away went carts and waggons—plows and flails.—Dar.Ay, and because I could not do as I would, while I was worth a farthing, sold off all—and up to Dublin I came, mounted on a long tail'd dobin—and to be sure I did not do things neatly—did not trim myself out in a smart suit of cloaths, and shew them the soul of an Irish lad—but hearing that there were some pretty boys of the Shamrock in London, I thought I'd see that too; I don't know how it was, but in taking leave of this body and that body, I muddled a little, and the blundering waterman, instead of putting me into a Parkgate Packet—launched me on board a ship bound for the Baltic—and I never discover'd the mistake 'till I found myself landed at Dantzick; but how came you to sell your English commission, and turn Prussian soldier?Pat.Why at present my country does not want my services, and I thought if it should want them, that they would not prove less deserving of George by being for the present under the tuition of so regular a disciplined a master as Frederick.—The Prussian arms were ever fam'd for regularity—pray how comes it they have made you so irregular?Dar.Irregular—the most regular—as regular to my two half gallons every day, as I was to Dermot's brown jug—But Patty, tho' you are my Captain, you and I may crack a joke now and then—the devil a harm will it do our strict Prussian discipline, for you and I, when we are snug, to talk over our merry meetings with our singing pot companions, Dermot and Father Luke, at the shoulder of murton.—Oh your honour [seeing Olmutz.] likes a shoulder of mutton—Enter OLMUTZ.I shall give orders to the sutler to dress you a nice one.Olm.Marshal Fehrbellin's complimenta—glad— hear of your arrival—expect you at camp—half an hour.Pat.Give my respectful compliments, and I'll do myself the pleasure to wait on him.Olm.Tell him so.Exit.Pat.Tall fellow—but of very few words.Dar.Very few, but he found enough to inform against me—but if I am not even with him for it, there are no potatoee in Munster.Pat.Eh, Darby—yonder's a fine lovely girl passing along there—do you know her?Dar.Oh, yes, she is a very fine girl—but we have flocks of such in Prussia—Lord, Sir, if you'll come along with me, I'll introduce you a-la-millitare.Darby going first, recollects himself, bows and follows.Pat.By all means, Darby.Exit.SCENE II.

Oh, pray what have you done with Norah?Pat.Norah I have left her to the care of Father Luke.Dar.What, old two to one, that brings mutton to his mouth by means of the multiplication table.Pat.But, Darby—where can I find apartments— where can I put on my shoes?Dar.We all wear boots in the camp—we shoe none but the horses.—But you shall lodge for the present at Mable Flourishes, where the officers mess—I'll order your baggage there, and to be sure to-morrow I won't it you up the smartest booth in the camp—so come along—Pat—come along Patty—oh, dear—this way, Captain—Captain Patty.Exit Darby.Pat.Very well, Mr. Darby; you seem very accommodating truly—and indeed if the girls are so handsome, and come much in my way, I shall stand in need of all my constancy.SONG.Away, ye giddy smiling throngOf tempting beauties, fair and young.My heart be true, altho' my tongueShou'd sing of lovely Flora;Or shou'd I gaze with fond desire,Shou'd breath of roses fan the fire;And tho' I on a touch expire,My soul is thine, sweet Norah.The bonds of Hymen o'er my mind,My constant soul must ever bind,To that dear woman left behind,My kind, my tender Norah;But, Oh! I fear each mortal part,Nay, e'en this true, this faithful heart,Resstless to the Urchin's dart,Shot by the eyes of Flora.Illusive vapour, transient blaze,Oh! vanish, while I wandering gaze,But shine like Dian's silver rays,My passion chaste for Norah;Yet Hymen winks, and Venus smiles,And passion ev'ry sense beguiles,And Cupid with his thousand wiles,Assist my charming Flora.Exit Pat.SCENE Outside of MABEL FLOURISHES.Wrote over the Door—The Officers Mess-House, by MABEL FLOURISH.Enter DARBY.Dar.I am strangely puzzl'd how to get this girl for Pat—she's so very modest.

Eh, here he comes, and little Quiz with him—that fellow always keeps company with great people—how high he carries his head with his hairy cap.
