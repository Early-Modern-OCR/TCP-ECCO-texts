Price one Shilling and Six-pence.]PROLOGUE.TELL me, ye matchless Fair! Ye fearless Brave!Is there one Briton— born to be a Slave?No.—While your Prince half Europe's Rihts maintains,Nor Souls, nor Bodies, here, can stoop to Chains.Angels, and Englishmen, like Homage, pay:Bow, but, from Love,—and, but by Choice obey:I oyal, to keason's Rights, not Slavery's Awe,The Sons of Freedom serve the Kings, of Law.Act, with no Clogs on Sense, no Clouds on Art,But let in Truth's whole Light, to hear the Heart.Such, once, was Rome-to Strength, not Luxury, train'd:Then Liberty was Hers, and Virtue reign'd:Safe, in her own felt Power, and bluntly brave,She scorn'd alike to be— or make— a Slave.No puny Popeling, yet, Man's Birth-right Stole:Foe, to th' invaded Empire—of the SOUL!Plain, prideless Rule bound short Ambition's Plea:But left Thought, Art, Faith, Hope, and Conscience free.Far other Fame was hers, when Church-craft reign'd,Then, every Cherub's Face, with Gall, was stain'd:Sweet-ey'd Religion, sow'rd, by priestly Leaven,Frown'd on pale Peace—and shook her Keys at Heaven.More than her Maker's Rights, She found too small,And murmur'd, that his Grants cou'd give —but ALL.Wil'd, Inconsistent, Blasphemous, and Vain,Revers'd God's Laws—to propogate his Reign!Her Creeds taught Curses.—Her proud Schools DebateNothing, but Fool, a Flattery, 'scap'd her Hate.She lov'd Obedience,—but she lov'd it, blind:And, safelier to subdue, debas'd Mankind.No Pardon, there, let Britain's Sins presume;Freedom, and Truth, are HERETICS—at Rome.Religion's Darkners will no Reverence feelFor Faith, that bears no Craft, and blinds no Zeal:Learning, uncurb'd by Cant; Truth, wash'd from Wiles,An Earth, that Reasons—and a Heaven that smiles:Homage, that no Sedition can betray,Yet Liberty, that laughs at lawless Sway.Such had the World's vain Mistress, then, been fram'd,When this Night's Story Rome's Attention claim'd;Freedom had nurs'd no Son, to blast her Reign,And Caesar had a Soul, without one Stain.Persons Represented.MEN.Julius Caesar, Dictator.Marcus Brutus, his Son by Servilia, but not knowing himself to be so.Marc Antony, Consul of Rome.Tabilius; A Roman Poet, favour'd by Brutus.Cassius,Cber,Demus,Casca,Cinna,Marcellus,
 Conspirators against Caesar.Trinovantius, A British Tribune, faithful to Caesar.Curio A Roman Tribune, in his Confidence.An Augur: Officers, Lictors, and Plebeians.WOMEN.Calphurnia, Caear's Wife.Portia, Wife to Brutus.Flavia, A Lady, Attendant on Calphurnia.SCENE.

What persidious Friendships cheat Mankind!CASSIUS.Laugh, and be wise.—So, to betray, gives Greatness.—Forget not thou, mean-while, to speed thy Charge:Prepare cold Brutus for the Day's Impression:Swell him, with all his prais'd Forefather's Pride;
Fume his enhaling Soul with Flatte'ry's Incence,And share divided Rome's best Hopes, with CassiusTORBILIUS.Why must Rome's Hopes depend on One Man's Aid?CASSIUS.All Men are Ours in Brutus.—Thou, and I,And every Roman, leagu'd, to cut off Caesar,Hate Caesar.—Every burning Breast, but His,Has sep'arate, inselt, private Cause, for Malice:Who will believe, we strike for Rome.—So known,So mark'd, malignant to the Name of Caesar?Brutus is Caesar's Idol!—and loves Caesar!His Aid will consecrate Revenge to Virtue.He can, when Caesar bleeds, turn Tears to Triumph,And blot the whitest Star, that lights his Character.TORBILIUS.But this is Baseness, Cassius!—grant it needful,The Man shou'd die—why must we kill his Virtues?Why, to oppose his reigning, must we robHis natural Rights?—why shade the Soul, he shines by?No—let us own the Beauties of his Heart:Weeping, confess his Brave'ry, Tempe'rence, Pity,Long patient Courtings of rejected Peace—Yet—dreadful Darings, in Contempt of Danger?Else, we shall spot Laws Face, with Marks of Envy,Treating this vastness of a Mind, like Heaven's,As if keen-ey'd for Guilt, but blind to Goodness.CASSIUS.Perish his Goodness!—grind my Ear no moreWith his curst Qualities:—I hate his Power:
I hate myself—hate Rome—hate Life, Joy, Victory,Hate every Hope, but one.—to make Him feel,That slighted Cassius drew down Fate on Caesar.This let me live to teach him—Then,—tho' Rome,Sunk, round me, till her tumbling CapitalSmoak'd, for my funeral Pile.—'Twere Death, with Glory.TORBILIUS.Cassius! my Soul, less fiery, cannot strainResentment into Frenzy:—In my Sense,Reason, not Rage, shou'd measure Plotter's Passions.Be temperate, orCASSIUS.Hastily.By Heaven! he comes! you GallerySounds, with his Step.—The holy Farce is ended:Poet,—farewell.—Exit Cassius.TORBILIUS.alone.Farewell, detested Envy!Motives like thine, turn Justice into Murder.Something shall, strait, be done.—Caesar! be safe:He, who forgave my Guilt, demands my Virtue.Exit.SCENE II.CAESAR, Preceded by Lictors, and Officers, and follow'd at some Distance, by an Augur.AUGUR.Caesar! imperial Caesar! hear the Gods.CAESAR.Go:—Thou art known.—The Gods, thou serv'st, are Senators:Cassrus, thy Phaebus—and his Gold, thy Jove.AUGUR.Rest, from this fatal March, restrain'd by Heaven,And, by such unpropitious Auguries, warn'd.CAESAR.Shame on your pious Frauds! they tire Indulgence.AUGUR.Check not the Voice of Truth: 'twas form'd, for Plainness.CAESAR.Own it with conscious Shame.—If Truth loves Plainness.Why are the God's clear Wills perplex'd, by Art?AUGUR.Speaks Rome's high Pontiff This?CAESAR.He does, bold Augur!'To rescue Zeal, from Pride's unhallow'd Claim;That robs, to reve'rence Heaven.AUGUR.Heaven calls for Faith.CAESAR.How dare you, then, make Infidels, by Falsehood?Wou'd you, o're Reason, stretch the Chain of Faith,Gild it, with Heaven's broad Light: Touch the taught Heart.Nobly, speak out:—and tell th' attracted World,Nothing is from the Gods, that shakes Man's Honesty.AUGUR.Oh! stay thy fatal March—change thy rash Views;Bid thy rais'd Eagles fall the expanded Wing:Air's plumy People, screaming from the Left,Stoop in their Flight, to warn Thee:—Omens on Omens,Bode unauspecious Doom—and teem, with Death.CAESAR.No more.Augurthe GodsCaesaraway—I know 'em, best,Who know 'em Friends to Virtue.—AUGUR.Virtue is Liberty.The Foes of Freedom can attract no Gods,To prop their falling Standards;—Heaven begloomsThy Star, with some dire Fate:—but what, is Darkness.CAESAR.Go: search it, in the Air,—and, if thou find'st it,Arm'd, in its ugliest Menace, bring it hither.—When Screams of Birds can shake a Soldier's Heart,Thou shalt lead Priests to fight, for feeble Rome,And lend their Arts, to Caesar.AUGUR.Tremble.—CAESAR.Away.Exit Augur.SCENE III.CAESAR alone.CAESAR.I wou'd, be happy.—Why, then, am I Great?Men, who desert their Peace, to serve their Glory,Toil, for the Malice of oblig'd Mankind:

That makes Men Siaves, at Soul.—THINK freely, BrutusAnd let us argue, like unbiass'd Romans:Thou talk'st of Rights—Rome's Rights:—are not the PeopleThe assembled People; ROME? Is not Law Theirs?Counsel, that, not complied with, would compell,Turns Law to Tyranny.BRUTUS.Shall Tumult reign?Shall high-born Senates serve, and Groundlings govern?CAESAR.No.—Mark the Senate's Bounds—and mark the People's:Foresight, and Guardian Care, and weigh'd Advice.Debated Means, and Remedies propos'd,These and these only, are the SENATE's Rights:Propounded Laws accepted, or refus'd,This is the PEOPLE's Claim: and both are Rome.BRUTUS.Thanks to the Gods, Rome boasts some Patriots, still.CAESAR.Yes—grasping Hopes undue and check'd of Aim,Patriots, in Aid of Vengeance! they combine,To clog the Wheels, they can no longer guide:Hiding low-self, behind the Public Cause,They Murmur, till they purchase private Ease,Then, License General Pain, to curse Mankind.BRUTUS.Held not the Senate Sale most Weight, in Rome?CAESAR.Rome felt it, Brutus—till my Arms relive'd her.BRUTUS.He, who, by Arms, rules Freemen, teaches Slaves—By Arms, to rule that Ruler.CAESAR.Trust a try'd Sword.BRUTUS.Curse its bold Use—in any Hand, but Caesar's,When, to the vulgar Herd, it levels Nobles,Born, to be Great—and mixes Hinds with Consuls.CAESAR.Born did'st thou say?—mark, how thy partial Pride,Barring the Gates of Hope, wou'd shut out Merit!No Man was ever Born, but form'd to Greatness:Who, but aspiring—Hinds—were—Rome's first Fathers?Unvulgar Spirit rais'd their Deeds to Fame,And, thence, unvulgar Reverence mark'd 'em Noble.—But, in our Hands, diminish'd Honour ShrinksTo bare Degree,—and shames the Rights of Rank.Heaven!—what a difference 'twixt Old Rome, and Ours?Our first fam'd Ancestors gave worth—to Blood:—We, from a worthless Birth, wou'd steal Distinction.Pensions, with us, take Place:—with them, 'twas Virtue.Our Av'rice Plunders Friends: Their conquering BountyTook nothing, ev'n from Foes—but Power of Insult.BRUTUS.Grant us less worthy; still Their Claims are Ours:And Sons, who basely quit their Father's Rights,Deserve to live, like Slaves—or die, like Traitors.CAESAR.Fie!—let us Blush, to name our Father's Right's,Who leave their Claim to Honesty, forgot!BRUTUS.Oft, in sunk States, when Power presumes, on Vice,New Crimes call out new Virtues.CAESAR.Rome's new VirtuesMatch her new Maxims: Mark their Grandeur, BrutusActive, in other's Industry, we build,—Race, Game, Dress, Dance, Feast, and drink deep, for Glory:Ours are the Tastes of Life: Let humbler StatesLearn its lean Duties:—We, to lighten Joy,Have, elegantly painless! cast off Care:—Hunger, and Thirst, and loose Desires—anticipate:Posponing nothing—but Thought, Fame, and Justice.Vallies we teach to rise: O'er levell'd HillsStretch the tir'd Sight:—But, inward turn no Eye:Ourselves the darkest Part of our own Prospect.Well say they, Rome is chang'd.—'Tis chang'd, indeed!Women are chang'd to Men,—and Men to Women.Anger has chang'd its Mark:—Roman's shock Roman's,Yet, tame to Parthian Insults, hold back Vengeance,That Robbers may have Rest,—and Bribery Leisure.ANTONY.To Sons of Faction, screen'd but by Rome's Crimes,Why name we Roman Virtues?BRUTUS.—On Thy VoiceDwells Eloquence, that make ev'n Error charming,O, too persuasive Caesar!—But Thou, Antony,
Shalt know, that, when fall'n Rome's degenerate ConsulsLive,—a King's Slaves,—Brutus shall die—a Roman.Exit.SCENE VIII.CAESAR. ANTONY.

There shou'd not:CALPHURNIA.Why is Ambition, then, too hard for Peace?Why, always busy, to be never blest,Does restless Caesar sacrifice, unthank'd,The Taste, the Quiet, the Serene, of Life,For an ungrateful World, that hates his Bounty?CAESAR.'Tis the great Mind's expected Pain, CalphurniaTo Labour for the Thankless:—He, who seeksReward in Ruling, makes Ambition Guilt:And, living for Himself, disclaims Mankind.CALPHURNIA.Alas!—the Friend to All obliges none.CAESAR.'Tis nobler to protect Mankind, than please.CALPHURNIA.Is it a Crime, when Virtue loves itself?CAESAR.Princes shou'd widen self:—Their Power, and Heart,Alike Receptive, must make room for All:'Tis theirs, to Sigh, for every Sufferer's Woe;Lend their own Joys, that others may be glad:Think ev'en for unborn Ages; and transmitBlessings unshar'd—and quiet, not their own.CALPHURNIA.Virtues, so rais-d, as these, but waste their Warmth,And shine, unfelt, in Rome.—The Vulgar EyeSees, by its own low Level:—As Men act,They judge: and, by corrupt Self-Interest weigh'd,Goodness, like Heaven's, wou'd seem Self-Interest, too.CAESAR.No Matter.—Virtue Triumphs, by Neglect:Vice, while it darkens, lends but Foil, to Brightness:And juster Times, removing Slander's Veil,Wrong'd Merit, after Death, is help'd to live.CALPHURNIA.Can present Pain be cur'd, by future Ease?CAESAR.Who wou'd not, once, look dim, to shine, for ever?CALPHURNIA.How happy is it for a Wife, who loves,When lowlier Prospects bound her Lord's Desires,And Home-felt Quiet fills his peaceful Heart!Why wou'd you be a King?—wait, till some KingAspires, to be a Caesar:—Lend not Envy
New Props to lean against: This threat'ning NameBeats on the Roman's unaccustom'd Ear,Like a black Storm—and blasts the Hope of Liberty.CAESAR.Never, henceforth, disturb thy gentle Breast,With false Forebodings, from a regal Toy!Know me above its Want:—beyond its Glory:Given, tho' unheld, It meets the Parthian Prophesy;Bids the rous'd Legion's superstitious HeartsResume lost Ardor:—and fure Victory's, Theirs.CALPHURNIA.Tho' Parthia fell, there's a Patrician Envy,That, never quench'd, burns but with fiercer Blaze,From each new Proof, that Old Injustice wrong'd thee:Taink of those Midnight Haunters of my Fancy!Think, how I saw thee bleed, at every Vein:While, at each spouting Stream, a murderous RomanStain'd his extended Arm, and roar'd for Liberty.Cassius!—stern Cassius!—starting up—Blast him, Heaven!—methinks,I see him, there,—full, in my Eyes, he glares!Pale, in the horrid Transport of his Vengeance;And, dreadfully, enjoys the ghastly Scene!—Kneels.Oh! grant thyself, to live: Grant sad CalphurniaThat Prayer:—She begs it, but for Rome, and Nature.CAESAR.Why wilt thou kneel?-What coud'st thou ask, in vain!CALPHURNIA.Death—instant Death, to that malignant Cassius!CAESAR.Since thou were't first my Wife, I never saw theeCruel, till this strange Moment!—Dovelike gentle,Healing Compassion sooth'd thy Heart, to Softness:And, on thy sparkling Eye, sat weeping Mercy.CALPHURNIA.'Tis Mercy, to Mankind, to punish Villains.CAESAR.Rise: and relieve me, from this new Distress.Bell rings without.CALPHURNIA.Rising.I will:—And thou shalt owe to Woman's FearA Safety, manly Confidence had lost Thee.CAESAR.How art thou heated, by an idle Dream,To strike at fansied Guilt, with real Anger!CALPHURNIA.The Wife of Caesar wrongs not, even his Foes.Flavia! Lucilia! here—who waits, without?Enter a Lady.The Man, with whom I held Discourse, this Morning!Bid him Re-enter.Exit Lady.CAESAR.Who!—What Man is this?CALPHURNIA.Torbilius—the sow're Satirist:—Thy Enemy.—CAESAR.No Enemy of mine—if Wit's his Friend.CALPHURNIA.Once, when condemn'd, for libelling my Caesar,
Thy all-permitting Mercy, not aloneForgave—but, bad him claim distinguish'd Bounty;Till Wit, misled, cou'd find the way to Judgment.CAESAR.I know him not:—What can'st thou hope, Calphurnid,From these slight Men?—So bold, yet, blind of Soul,That Wit, with them, supplies the Place of Virtue;And, censuring other's Faults, absolves their own.CALPHURNIA.Staying, when Portia went, his trembling Gratitude.Pray'd Audience, in a Cause, that touch'd the LifeOf threat'ned Caesar:—For the Rest, he comes:Let his own Tongue retrace the horrid Tale.SCENE II.CAESAR, CALPHURNIA, TORBILIUS.TORBILIUS.Hail, Caesar! more than Victor!—Common ConquerorsVanquish but Power: Caesar subdues the Will.CAESAR.Why dost thou flatter!—Stranger to my Passions,Whence wou'd thy Skill presume, to judge my Virtue?Take heed, thou sell'st not Praise, to purchase Scorn!Encomium is a bold, and dange'rous Province!It calls for Reason:—Slander asks but Rage:Who drt Thou?—what is thy Pretence, in Rome?TORBILIUS.Touch'd by the Muse's Love, I, there, indulgeThe tuneful Transports of Satiric Fire:Rome is a fruitful Field, for Themes, like mine!And Brutus, wit's kind Patron! loves my Verse.CAESAR.Where Wit wants Patronage—a State wants Wisdom.Keen, tho' the Darts, by angry Genious thrown,The Wise can Guide 'em, while the Base Restrain:Satire, in honest Hands, is Murmuring Virtue:And He, who fears its Hiss, deserves its Sting.Yet, tis a dangerous, and malignant, Good!Tho' Freedom's Property, 'tis Faction's Spoil.Where justly bold, 'tis Reason's manliest Impulse:Where blindly virulent, 'tis Wit's Disease.Think, and distinguish:—Are thy Censures weigh'd?Dost thou Proportion Anger, to its Cause?TORBILIUS.Had I done that, I had not wrong'd thy Name:I was not just:—For, I was Caesar's Foe.—Can Caesar have forgot Torbilius Asper?CAESAR.Why wonder'st thou at that?—For my own Sake,My Friend imprints Remembrance;—but my Foe,For His, shou'd be FORGOTTEN.TORBILIUS.Generous Caesar,Forgetting me, forgets the Guilt, he pardon'd,And Claims not his own Virtues!CAESAR.Roman! learnTo measure Truth, more justly:—Benefits,From their Receiver only, claim Remembrance:He, who bestows, and not forgets—resumes 'emTORBILIUS.Perish the Mem'ory, and the Man, together,When I forget such Greatnef?—CALPHURNIA.Spare thy Words:—And hasten to disclose thy Thanks, in Action.CAESAR.What know'st Thou, that deserv'd Attention, here?TORBILIUS.Cassius, whose Love of Rome, is Hate of Caesar,Lists an implicit Clan of warm Resenters:Men, who, with dim Discernment, tracing Liberty,Plunge headlong in Sedition.—Among these,He stoop'd his active Bribe'ry, ev'n to me:Courting my humble Aid, to influence Brutus,Whose Name, and Power, might Mask the Face of Murder.CAESAR.Whom would they Murder?TORBILIUS.—Rome's last Hope, in Caesar.CALPHURNIA.Now, Caesar! now, am I an idle Dreamer?CAESAR.Does Brutus know this Purpose?TORBILIUS.—Yet he does not:And Caesar, still, might guard the generous HeartOf his belov'd: And save him, from the Vile.All Flatter'y's full-try'd Power Unites, to shake him:That done, the Tempter ply's his Master Engine;Draws him, this Day, to meet the assassin Faction:Then—but that Heaven defends Thee—join'd by Brutus,Th' encourag'd Murde'rers strike:—not join'd forbear.CAESAR.If Caesar's Death must wait, till Brutus strikes,His Life wou'd prove immortal!—Men, of Heat,Like Cassius, torture their distemper'd Reason,To Act their Passion's Impulse:—Brutus weighsDesire's warm Pleas, in the cool Scale of Justice:Finds Force, in Other's Claims, against Himself,And loves the Virtue. that condemns him.CALPHURNIA.Go on, Torbilius!—Set, in Caesar's View,What Cassius loves; and Point us out His Virtues.CAESAR.It shall not need:—He stands condemn'd, already.CALPHURNIA.Joyfully.To what condemn'd?CAESAR.Condemn'd to live, Calphurnia.CALPHURNIA.What! and not tortur'd?CAESAR.—Pride's severest RackIs that sharp Mercy, which descends from Scorn.Think it a Fault, to fear these choleric Praters:Their hot, slight, Threat'nings waste themselves, in Slander;And rail away Revenge, to gradual Peace:But, there's a cold, slow, silent, patient Malice,That carries Mischief with it!—Such a Soul,As Brutus Acts by—had it Will, for Murder:Cool, in its govern'd Hate, might call for Cruelty.—What read'st Thou?TORBILIUS.—Silent Summoners, to MurderThese Cassius Causes to be dropt, with Art,Where Brutus must be sure to find, and read 'em.CALPHUREIA.What wiles has Malice!CAESAR.Poor, and petty, Crafts!They want but my Regard, to lend 'em Weight.Returning the Paper.Torbilius, meet 'em:—and, with strictest Note,Mark, what Impression Cassius makes on Brutus.All, Thou canst learn of That, be swift to bring me;And trust the Claims of Gratitude, to Caesar.TORBILIUS.The grateful make no Claims.—A mindful DebtorPays—not obliges:—Never met, in one,The Poet, and the Miser:—The same Fire,]That sparkles, in his Fancy's native Blaze,Glows, at his honest Heart; and burns out Baseness:True Genious will not—cannot; stoop to Bribes:And He, who sells his Passions, ne're had Wit,—Or had it, for a Curse, unmix'd with Judgment.CAESAR.'Tis nobly said;—and, with a warmth, that onlySuspected Virtue feels.—Henceforth, be mine:On modest Merit, not to force Reward,Were to degrade Supremacy.CALPHURNIA.Where meet They?TORBILIUS.In the cool Grot, behind the Platan Grove:There Brutus, oft alone, and oft with Friends,Steals an unbusied Hour, for reasoning deeply:Or, in free Mirth, dilates the slack'ning Soul.CALPHURNIA,What was the appointed Time?TORBILIUS.The fatal Choice,Yet doubtful, must depend alone on Brutus.Some Three Hours, hence, I look to find 'em met,CALPHURNIA.Go, good Tarbilius.—Wait within my Call:For I shall Try thy Faith in Caesar's Cause.Exit TorbiliusSCENE III.CAESAR, CALPHURNIA.CALPHURNIA.I am alarm'd. for Brutus!CAESAR.Doubt him not:CALPHURNIA.Is he ambitious?CAESAR.No,—but he is vain.CALPHURNIA.Then, beyond Hope, he's lost.—Ambitious MenLead, and discern—but vain Ones follow, blind.CAESAR.Thou hast contagious Power, in that Suspicion:
Great Minds, on some unguarded Quarter, weak,Find their try'd Virtue, there, sublimely frail:Were Cassius artful!—Had his Malice, Coldness,—Cou'd he first praise,—and, then, attack, where warmest,The Public-hearted Brutus.CALPURNIA.Nay he does;'Tis from that Point, he levels all his Aim.—Who knows not Brutus proud!—and Flattery's ArtSets Pride at work, to sap her own Foundation:And pull down Character, to build up Name.CAESAR.Then, Cassius merits my regard:—and dies:Light, in himself, he, yet, deserves but Scora:Awak'ning Danger, in corrupted Brutus,He makes his own rais'd Mischief worth Revenge.CALPHURNIA.But, can I trust a Doubt, like this, to chance?Th' unsure Conversion of a rash Man's Spleen?Who knows, but, feigning Penitence, TorbiliusCourts you to Confidence, he would betsay?No.—It shall ne'er be said, that Caesar's WifeLeft Caesar's Safety, to Another's Faith.She, who, too lightly weighs a Husband's Danger,Takes Arms, at Heart, against him.CAESAR.Trust Torbillius,He will deserve thy Faith:—Reflecting Minds,By Gratitude once gain'd, relapse no more.CALPHURNIA.Thus will I sound his Purpose:—then, confide.—Portia, this Morning, press'd a Visit, from me:Oft, thro' her Garden's private Gate, unmark'd,Ent'ring alone, that Grot, invites my Notice:There, silently conceal'd, where Art-form'd RocksLend jutting Umbrage to the cavy Screen,I hear, what Cassius moves:—What Brutus yields:This, if the Satrist dissuades:—he's false:This, if he aids, Calphurnia judges Cassius:And Life, or Death, be His, as Justice Dooms.CAESAR.In Love, and Anger, Woman's Will is deaf;I know, thy gen'rous Purpose is too firm,To let my Fears for Thee, forbid this Danger.Yet, while, in Dread of mine, thou dar'st thus rashly,Be it my Care to interpose, in Thine.Curio, the Tribune, with a Guard, must wait Thee.CALPHURNIA.Their Number will detect me.CAESAR.No,—let Torbilius,Singly, and slow, unnotic'd, introduce 'em;Thro' the lone Postern, that adjoins the Grove.CALPHURNIA.Bless the kind Thought!—And now, shou'd Murder dareOne Glance, at thy dear Bosom, bloody CassiusShall, on the guilty Spot, that Moment die.CAESAR.Spare thy disorder'd Heart.—Cassius is hasty!
But, Brutus shall with mild Reproof, reduceThe Madman's Rage, and shame him into Safety.I dread to arm Thee.—Prejudice is rash.—CALPHURNIA.Have I been subject, then, to rash Impressions?CAESAR.Thy Reason, I cou'd trust—but not thy Anger:Religion's Curb, in Hert's, like Thine, binds surest:Swear, by some sacred Tye.—CALPHURNIA.Hear me, whole Heaven!By Rome's raiss'd Fate!—By her Forefather's God's!By aweful Vesta's unexpiring Flame!By Venus, Mther of thy Race, o' Caesar!If Treason leaves out Time to reach thy Ear,E're Danger catch thy Life—Cassius shall live,To learn his Doom from Thee.—and 'scape my Vengance.CAESAR.See! the concurring Gods have sent Thee Curio!SCENE IV.CAESAR, CALPHURNIA, CURIO.CURIO.Shouts, from patient Crowds, demand a King;And royal aesar glads the Streets of Rome.CAESAR.after writing in a Table-Book.Curio!—Joy's flattering Sounds are loud Deceivers:—Clphurnia's busy Fears have trac'd a Traitor,Brn to high Rank, and fam'd for Arms, and Envy.Go, with due Strength; guard thou the Wife of Caesar:
And, if this Blank, that, now, conceals his Name,Fill'd, by her Hand, points out the guilty Roman,Weigh Caesar's Life, with His:—and be this WarrantThy Sword's Authority, to do me Right.giving the Table-Book to Curio.CURIO.Where e're your Danger warrant's me to strike,If Treason 'scape my Sword—let Flight in War,Want—and eternal Infamy, Revenge,The Cause of Caesar, on his Soldier's Name!CAESAR.Marc Antony return'd!CALPHURNIA.Curio! thy Ear.—SCENE V.CAESAR, ANTONY.ANTONY.All is prepar'd;—pale Cassius Looks, still paler:And starts at every Shout, that Shakes the Forum:Never, henceforth, let Noise be call'd Sedition:Rome's public Mouth outroars a hundred Senates!One loud Consent unites her grateful Tribes,And Parthia's Fall takes Date, from Caesar's Crown.CAESAR.Join'd Brutus, in that Voice.—ANTONY.No Roman hop'd it:Reserves, they know, must guard the Stoick's Gravity:What sowre Solemnity of Look, like His,
Stoops a lost Smile, to grace Plebeian Lightness!Men, who can laugh, as I do—jovial Thinkers!Fram'd for their Ease, and born, to hate Affliction!See Things, but as they are! void of the Wit,That hunts for cover'd Anguish! long, sound Sleepers!Dull, satisfied, glad Rogues! they trust their Senses,Love their Friend's, best: and wish, but what they want.Brutus is deep:—dives farther into Bliss—Shakes his superior Brow, and pities Fools,Who dare be happy, against Rules of Policy,CAESAR.Where coud'st thou find him, now?ANTONY.Immur'd, at Home,Sagely despising his good Lords,—the People:—And shutting Caesar's Triumph, from his Ear.CAESAR.Take this Occasion, Antony, to visit him;Bid his wish'd Presence grace thy publick Zeal!If he declines it, sting him, to Resentment:Watch, in that Warmth of Heart. what Thoughts escape him;Sound the dark Depth of his Designs;—and tell him,That to the Capitol, thou mean'st to bring me:Rome's Crown, by Freemen given to guard their Liberty,ANTONY.How noisy is that Nothing! All its VirtueDwells in its Sound:—It means but covered Tyranny.CAESAR.Ever distinguishing Substances, from Sound:
There is in Liberty, what God's approve;And only Men, like Gods, have Taste, to share.There is in Liberty, what Pride perverts,To serve Sedition, and perplex Command:True Liberty leaves all Things free,—but Guilt;And fetters every Thing,—but Art and Virtue.False Liberty holds nothing bound, but Power,And lets loose every Tye, that strengthens Law.ANTONY.Caesar, in Science, as in Power, Supream,Calls Lustre, out of Darkness!—But to Me,What seems most strange, of Faction's strange Effects,Is, that among those Crowds, she tempts to Mischeif,I see good Men, belov'd for every Virtue!Blindly misdrawn, to hate the peace they wish.CAESAR.Boast fully blind, a Bigot's Proof is Trust;Faultless in Purpose, yet—his Choice unjust!Active, that erring Zeal may Truth invade,Enthusiast Pride obtrudes her blund'ring Aid.Fierce to the Field, keen Disputants she draws,Implicit Props of some unreasoning Cause!Th' absur'd Reformer Order overthrows,And works up Discord—for the World's Repose!Jealous of Enemies, disquiets Friends,Groans, without Wound; and without Fruit, contends,Wildly sincere! unprevalently strong!Struggling for Right—and introducing Wrong:End of the Second Act.ACT III.SCENE I.A Grand Apartment in the House of Brutus.BRUTUS, ANTONY.BRUTUS.URGE it no more—I am fix'd.ANTONY.Think wiselier BrutusBRUTUS.Consul! when bold Oppression grapples Law,Men, who protect the Oppressor, stab the State.ANTONY.Men, who so roughly dare Mischarge their Lord,Pretending Liberty, pursue but Pride.BRUTUS.Caesar, however rais'd, is less than Lord.ANTONY.Caesar however wrong'd, is more than Friend:Even Gratitude has made Respect, a Duty:Present, or absent Thou—the Tribes will crown him.BRUTUS.Crown? whom?ANTONY.One, whom if Brutus knew but rightly,BRUTUS.I fear I do!ANTONY.No—if you did, you'd tremble.BRUTUS.I have already, trembled Antony!Trembled—to hear a Roman tempt a Roman,And dare corrupt a Patrsot, yet unsold!ANTONY.Corrupt, I wou'd not.—All I wou'd, I dare.BRUTUS.The basely bold shou'd learn, to dread the Just.ANTONY.When Brutus bids me dread—I hear and Smile.BRUTUS.Smile on your King: Flattery was made for Thrones.The rough, wrong'd Roman frowns, with honest scorn.ANTONY.Brutus, I rev'erence Firmness; but despiseTh' Hypocrisy of Envy! I have a heart,That being human, feels for humankind.I tow're not to the Gods:—Virtue, once rais'dAbove Compassion, ceases to be Virtue:Aiming at more than Man, thou sink'st to less.BRUTUS.I wou'd be less than King; and more than Slave.ANTONY.Farewell:—rash Zealots blindly grow unjust;And Pride inflexible,, and deaf, as Thine,Professing Virtue, make's ev'n Virtue hateful.Exit.SCENE II.BRUTUSalone.Heaven! what a Change in Rome!—breathe these her SouOh! griev'd Quirinus! what Reproach wero Thine,Did not thy fellow Gods disdain to note us!Rome has no Remnant, now, of Roman Greatness:Sold, or seduced, we give up Claim by Claim,Till even our Virtues are engros'd by Caesar!O, Souls of long lost Glory!

Thou intrud'st on my Retirement:The Muse, and my sad Heart are, now, not social,TORBILIUS.Cassius approaches.—There's a Name, indeed,Unsocial!—Every Muse wou'd start, to hear it.BRUTUS.Thou wrong'st him.—Cassius is a noble Roman.TORBILIUS.There is a Jaundice, in thy Judgment, Brutus,That lends him Golden Colour, from thy own:I know him, to the Soul.—Have sounded allThe Shallows of his Envy;—and I cou'd,But that an Oath, injoin'd, has bound my Tongue,
Convince thee, that he dares assault thy Honour;And plots, to blast thee to the World, for ever.BRUTUS.Who bound thee, by such Oath?TORBILIUS.Calphurnia's Piety.BRUTUS.What had Calphurnia's Piety to doWith Plots? and Oaths? and Secrecy? and Brutus?TORBILIUS.Earnest, herself, to warn endanger'd BrutusWith Consequence, she fear'd, my Words might lose,She claims your instant Ear:—Be swift—incline it.Shun the too near Approach of Cassius, hither:And, hast'ning to the House of Caesar, weigh,What her Wish forms, to guard thy Fame, and Virtue.BRUTUS.Thou art too bold, Torbilius:—Tell Calphurnia,I, best, myself, defend my Honour's Claims:And grasp, too hard, to need a Woman's Aiding.Torbilius!—Rome has lost thee.—Caesar's BountiesHave brib'd thy Gratitude, to slander Honesty.TORBILIUS.Ill am I known, where, most, my Heart lies open,If, after all my rash Contempts of Power,Brutus can doubt me Venal:—Yet, doubt on:No undeserv'd Reproach adheres to Virtue.No Matter what bold Slander wounds Torbilius,Where he, who Wrongs him, has the Rights of Friendship.BRUTUS.I will not see Calphurnia.TORBILIUS.Oh! revoke those fatal Words, lestBRUTUS.By the Gods! I will not; till Cassius, and his Friends have, first, been heard.TORBILIUS.Cassius is Caesar's Enemy.BRUTUS.But I am Brutus;- and thou know'st me Caesar's Friend.Let that Truth, known, content thee.TORBILIUS.—No.—It cannot:Brutus not fearing, I must fear for Brutus.Greatness of Soul, confiding in itself,Exposes an unguarded Side, to Baseness.BRUTUS.What woud'st thou lead me to?TORBILIUS.To one kind Promise:I urge it but to save thee.—I conjure thee;By every Claim of long, untir'd Adherence!By every Recompence, thou ow'st my Dangers!By every grateful Sense of every Duty!Love, Friendship, Reverence, Faith, Advice, and Service!Promise, whatever dire Result the GodsPermit,—for Cassius comes on no light Errand!Previous to any Deed, thy will may purpose,To hear my Thoughts:—Intrust me with thy own:And teach my willing Hand, and Heart, to aid thee.BRUTUS.I see the strangely mov'd:—I will, by Heaven!Intrust thee, unreserv'd, and seek thy Counsel.TORBILIUS.Bark on, ye Dogs of envy!

And War's brave Guider!".Timely, to cool this Madness, at its Height,So Heaven decreed it!—In Stalks Antony;Blast him, deaf Genius of devoted Rome!A cushion'd Crown, and Scepter, sham'd his Hands:
Yet, was his venal Eye fix'd bold, on Caesar.Down sunk, at once, the Tempest of Applause;Hush'd, as a Coward, in his Midnight Bush,The sick'ning People flatter'd into Silence;He, 'midst a horrid Glare of wide-stretch'd Eyes,Unheeding, on his Master's Brow, set, soft,The regal Gew-gaw:—Then, with abject Knee,Bent, for inflructive Homage,—be a KING,He cry'd—and reign o'er Rome, that rules the World,Caesar, mean while, who watch'd the public Eye,And read Reluctance, Grief, and Terror, there;Starting indignant with well-acted Scorn,Hurl'd, from his Front, the uninclining Toy;And cry'd—"I am not King, my Friend—but Caesar.BRUTUS.O, Truth!—Beyond all Pride of kingly Greatness!CIMBER.Then, general Joy new-voic'd the gaping Press;And shook the distant Roofs, with loud Concurrence;Even Antony, then, blush'd.CASSIUS.—And did not Caesar?CIMBER.Caesar smil'd sweet Contempt:—And then, again,Th' unfeeling Fools, more charm'd, renew'd their Shouting:I laugh'd, aloud: to mark him thanking Rome,For finding Virtues in him, which he had not!At length, disdainful of the hard Constraint,Parting, he frown'd Sincerity.—The RestYou'l learn, when I do.BRUTUS.What means That?CIMBER.—Anon,The Senate sits.BRUTUS.What then?CIMBER.Why then, Six HoursMay pass, betwixt his pushing back the Crown,And our exacted Votes, to bid him take it.BRUTUS.Holds he that Hope?DECIMUS.Yes: And who helps us?CASSIUS.—Death.BRUTUS.Death is, indeed, the Slave's last Hope:—but, he,Who dares embrace that Help, might find a better.CASSIUS.While my doom'd Country had a Gasp for Life,I struggled on, to live:—Now, World, farewell!No God sustain'd me, to support the State:But, to die, with it, still, is left to Freedom.To Heaven's imperial Rome, from ours, I go;There, no bold Caesar sways:—There Pompey serves!No Roman, there, need blush to owne a Master:Where even a Cato finds, and fears, a Lord!These will I follow, thus.Drawing his Sword.BRUTUS.Disarming him.—Follow we none:'Tis ours, to lend, not borrow, brave Example.
'Tis ours, to stem the Tide of a bad World,And justify to Time the Roman Greatness.Much is to Anger due—but more to Rome.Cato had died, unblam'd—first, killing Caesar;But, turning on himself, his erring Sword,He fell, unjustly:—For, he punish'd Innocence.CASSIUS.What can we, in a World, despairing, round us?BRUTUS.Shewing a Billet.See! What the Friends of Liberty expect!See! What they hope from Romans!CASSIUS.This ReproachI, too, have met with:—And 'twas hard to bear!BRUTUS.Cassius!—'twas harder, far,—to have deserv'd it.CIMBER.Good Talkers might attract a Gown-man's Praise:And had Time Ears—fine Words were Marks of Wisdom:But lose this Day, no Orator, in Rome,Must be admir'd, but Caesar.BRUTUS.—E're this DayYet passes,—Twenty Tyrant's Fortunate,As ours—but never Greatness equall'd Caesar!Might expiate, with their Lives, their bold Ambition.CIMBER.Ay! That's a Flower of Speech, my Rhetoric reaches!CASSIUS.Rome lives again! She breath'd, in that rais'd Voice!

And think, by whom!Ingratitude's a Guilt, that startles Nature,And, with a Fury's Foulness, stains Mankind!Constrain her, Curio!—Force her gently, on:PORTIA.Stay, Stay—I will be heard,—cruel Calphurnia!CALPHURNIA.Alas! What woud'st thou say?PORTIA.—Wou'd I cou'd tell!Wou'd I were skill'd in Woe, to touch thy Pity!Perhaps, I shou'd be Humbler?—Teach me, tell me.Oh! I'm not stubborn.—If the Queen of Caesar,Waits for the bended Knee; and, looking downTo suppliant Homage, tastes the Flatterer's Prayer:See! Portia, prostrate on the Dust, implores thee,Kneels.See her Soul agoniz'd,—and ease her Terrors.Grant him but Life! Spare his mistaking Virtue:Banish him—far from Rome, and Power, and Caesar.To unhous'd Seythia's bleakest Wilds, expose him:Leave him one—one—but one! Sad, humble Shelter!His Portia's aching Bosom!—Never—ah?—Never,Will she forsake him!—Off, ye glittering Trifles!Tears off her Jewels.Ye Toys! That help to blind unbless'd Distinction!Come—in their Place—Despair! Affliction! Penitence!Be these my Claims!—For these my Brutus shares in.Shuddering, and bare, I'll trace th' unsheltry DesertTread the bleak Wilderness of Want, unsighing,Unwishing Comfort, and content with Pain.Sleepless, myself, I'll watch his weary Slumbers,Feed his pale Fire, hang o'er his heedless Bosom:Break ye rude Snow-drifts, which the Storm blows round him,And love him into Taste of safe Distress.CALPHURNIA.To the Soldiers.Why will ye wound Compassion, by Delay?The Sorrows of a suffering Friend, are Torture,
None, but a Devil, at once can cause, and bear.Relieve me, and, with tenderest Force, obey.PORTIA.To the Soldiers,Reverence, ye Slaves of Power! The Race of Cato:His unsubmitting Soul survives, in mine:And swells against Compulsion.Soldiers step back.—Dare not think,I dread to die.—But know, that Portia's DeathShall be the Choice of Portia.At a Signal from Calphurnia, they seize her Hands.—Hope, as soon,To claim impassive Spirit!—High Disdain,Resisting Insult, at a Thousand Doors,Can let out Life, and laugh at vain Restraint!I will, with stubborn Pain, imprison Breath,And burst, indignant, from a World, that holds me.I will, on stony Pavements, hard and cold,As deaf Calphurnia! Dash my dizzy Brain:I'll swallow Fire:—Rend, with impatient Teeth,This suffering Flesh, and plunge from hated Light:Unhand me, Torturers! Murderers!—Help! HELP!I will extend my Voice, if Brutns hears not,Till the forgetful Gods are rous'd to Justice!CASSIUS.From the Garden.Where are you? say!

A Change, like this, might prompt weak Minds,To justify Despair, and give up Virtue.But I, who trust the Gods, with good Men's Safety,Know, that, in Caesar's Triumphs, Heaven but guardsTh' assaulted Greatness, which, Itself, inspir'd:Rising against Distress, Calphurnia smilesAt Traitor's Threats, and brightens from Eclipse.Fearless, to persevere her Lord has taught her;And, from meant Evil, force unwilling Good.All, Thou must hope, when Caesar's cloudless StarMeets, and shines through, and burns above this Tempest;Is—that my Sentence may remain suspended,Till the Dictator's never-wearied MercyPours Penitence, on the touch'd Heart of Brutus.PORTIA.Slow Blessings come too late, and bring new Curses:This, but a Moment past, had sav'd us, Both:Now, Portia rules not, here:—Tis angry Cassius:The proud Conspirators possess my Gates,And Brutus, absent, leaves me to their Power,He flew, to warn those rash, discover'd, Romans:But hasty Rage makes frustrate every Care.
—Yet, claim what e're my Weakness can:—Tis dueTo kind Forgiveness of a Friend's first Fault:To our past Wish's, and our present Fears:For, ah! Who knows, what dire Events impend,To blast eluded Hope, and make both wretched?—Come, to my Chamber, let us sadly move,Pensive, from Fear, and terrified for Love:There, let us mourn Ambition's restless Rage,And mutual Mise'ry mutual Help engage.CALPHURNIA,Warm, from my willing Heart, I join that Prayer,Ne're may Ambition waste a good Man's Care!Vain are his Hopes reluctant Foes to bless:And still, the more his Toils, his Praise the less.End of the Fourth ACT.ACT.V.SENEI.A Court before the Capitol.CASSIUS, CIMBER, CINNA, CASCA.CIMBER.Sure! Never Day ran back, like this, before!So sweet a Dawn, so chang'd, at once to Tempest:CASSIUS.Chang'd, like the Fate of Rome! Above, tis Sunshine:Beneath, tis, all, due Darkness!—Senate's PowerShall brighten, and plebeian Clouds ride low.What hasty Footstep that?CIMBER.—'Tis Decimus!Enter Decimus.CASSIUS.Alone! Why comes not Brutus?DECIMUS.—Near thy HouseI met him hast'ning to suppend our Meeting:And urg'd the general Cause, that claim'd his Presence.CASSIUS.He shou'd not, yet, have heard of Portia's Danger,Nor Caesar's Warrant, found.—DECIMUS.I told no moreThan that Torbilius, trusted with our Names,Lodg'd 'em, in Caesar's Hand.—So, what, before,Was common Glory, common Safety, now,Demanded instant:—therefore, here we met,No more to part, till Rome, or Caesar fall.CASSIUS.Heard he that, firmly?DECIMUS.He's at Hand, to join us.CASSIUS.Then Fate is Ours: And this proud Climber's HeightSinks to the Level, where his Name shall rot:Mark, with what Ease a Tyrant's Empire falls!But yesterday, this Man's exalted PraiseTrod on the Stars: and Caesar was a God!
To Day, the insulting Foot of Rome shall spurn him,And mix his powerless Ashes with the Dust.CIMBER.Hark! Was not that a Scream?CASSIUS.Some Prophet Raven,That, conscious, on the Dome's high moold'ring Roos,Feels, and foretells, that Caesar's Ghost is rising.A Noise hear'd, without, like the Fall of a BuildingCIMBER.Some horrid Ruin that!CASSIUS.Look out, good Decimus.DECIMUS.Looking outAmazement! The long, venerable, LineOf Statues,—All Rome's old, and aweful ChiefsLie fallen! And shapeless Fragments load the Floor!Long, and loud Thunder.CIMBER.Shoud not a Change, like this, that mixes PalacesWith the up heaving Center, at the Moment,When our bold Purpose moves, alarm our Caution?CASSIUS.Blow, till ye burst, ye big-mouth'd Menacers!'Tis but a Breeze, to Hearts, inflam'd for Glory.CIMBER.Breeze!—In such Breezes, Furies imp their WingsDeath! The Storm howls, as if the Winds felt Envy;And woudd out-mouth the Thunder!—Call ye ThisA Breeze?—my Feet want Steadiness!—The Pavement,
Heav'd, in disjointed Surge, rolls loose beneath me.CASSIUS.By Heaven, tis Glorious Ruin!—Round our HeadsFall Rome's imperial Turrets:—Earthquake, and TempestPlow the mix'd Elements: Noises, far heard,Live, in the Winds, and Voice the frantic Air.Day darkens: and the Eye of Heaven seems quench'd.Nature's wide-loos'ning Fabrick shakes, about us!While we, with Nerves of Steel, press on to Vengeance.Oh! my brave Friends! What future Fame is Ours!What Cato cou'd not—what nor Asia's Aid,Nor Pompey's failing Fleets—not tawny Afric,With all her Sun-defying Swarms of War!We few—we, Roman Few—have done—this Day!CIMBER.One Way, or other, we shall serve the Senate:Living, we set it free.—And, if we die,We teach it to vote safe;—and rail, in private.DECIMUS.See! What a pensive Visage Brutus brings!CASSIUS.Save us! He looks, as if the tumbling StatuesHad crush'd him into Cowardice!SCENE II.CASSIUS, CIMBER, DECIMUS,CINNNA, CASCA, BRUTUS.BRUTUS.Rome's lost.CIMBER.Then, Coesar timely warn'd, has shun'd his Danger.BRUTUS.No.—The last Thing, Caesar will shun, is Danger.—Roman's! Attnd; and weep your Country's Fate:I swore the Death of Caesar:—Curse me not,Ye Parent Gods!—I thought it due, to Rome.To Law—to Liberty—to Man's lost Rights;To Power's Restraint, and a deliver'd World.The Hour—the dreadful Hour, high Heaven! I nam'd!Ev'n now, its, last dire Moment calls on Brutus:And now, ev'n now, Brutus is Caesar's—SON!Conspirator's, all start, and look down, in a speechless Astonishment.BRUTUSafter a long Pause.Servilia was in secret wedlock join'd—And gave Heself, and me—to Caesar's Love.Conspirators still silent, fix'd, and amaz'd.BRUTUS.After another short Pause.Is there a Roman, so benumb'd of Soul,So firm, so passionless, so steel'd a Stoick!So nerv'd, beyond all vulgar Strength of Man!That he dares urge what Brutus swore to do?Cassius!—Thou tremblest.—CASSIUS.Thou shalt tremble, too,At the last Counsel, I will live, to give thee.BRUTUS.Think, e're thou speak'st—for Nature is at Stake;And, list'ning, dreads th' Advice, thou dar'st obtrude.CASSIUS.Mark then—were Brutus of Plebeian Mould,Cassius wou'd say, serve on: The Tyrant Son
Shou'd aid th' Ambition of the Tyrant Father.Rome had but mark'd two Caesar's for one Fate.But thou wer't born her Friend—thy Name is Brutus,And every Brutus breath'd, to bless Mankind.Thy changeless Heart, inflexible for Virtue,Patriots a Tyrant Blood, tho' drawn from Caesar.BRUTUS.Be dumb—be warn'd—'twere impious more to hear thee,CASSIUS.Nay mark—thou know'st what Cataline propos'd,When, with a Rebel Hand, he shook his Country:BRUTUS.I know it, Cassius!CASSIUS.—On that lawless Day,When, desp'rate, he presum'd an Act, like Caesar's,Suppose—all—wily, with a Tyrant's Craft,This Catiline had claim'd thee, for his Son?BRUTUS.Roman thou wrong'st me.—CASSIUS.Call me, then no Roman:BRUTUS.Twas a disgraceful Question:—It imply'd,—A Brutus might be brib'd, to wrong his Country.CASSIUS.Caesar yet lives.—BRUTUS.—Caesar—and Catiline!Gods!—what Disparities thou yok'st together!—That Caesar's Policy not feigns me His,
Learn—I have Proof, too plain.—Servilia spokeSpoke, from the Shades of Death, and own'd me Caesar's.CASSIUS.Did her Ghost tell this Dream?BRUTUS.The Dream is Thine,Light Cassius!—She confess'd it, in her Letter:CASSIUS.Caesar has Arts, beyond thy honest reaching,—But, let it pass—Caesar is Caesar, still;—Be Bruus cheated, by his Tale, or no—He no less guilty.—Thou no less a Roman.BRUTUS.If he's my Father.—CASSIUS.Rome was still his Mother:Where lives a bolder Paricide, than Caesar?BRUTUS.Away—my shrinking Soul abhors thy Purpose!If I am Caesar's Son, Caesar, to me,Is faultless:—Nature made me not his Judge.And, till Rome's Gods redeem her, Brutus dares not.CASSIUS.If Duty binds—thy Soul was Son to Cato:He form'd thy Truth, thy Firmness, and thy Virtue:He taught thee to revere the Gods, thou swor'st by:And feel the sacred Force, that firms on Oath.BRUTUS.Perish an Oath—against the Birth, I breathe by!CASSIUS.Thou but contribut'st Faith, to help Deceit!
Thou art not—can'st not be—the Son of Caesar:I know, thou art not.BRUTUS.Cassius!—If I am!—What Clash of Contradictions rends my Soul!Horror, and Piety, divide my Virtue,Save Caesar, all ye Gods!—But save Rome from him,CASSIUS.Caesar must not be safe,—Or, Rome must fall.BRUTUS.Oh, Cassius! partial Hatred weighs unjustly:Mercy so tempers his Pretence to Power,That Tyranny grows safe—and looks, like Freedom.CASSIUSThere is an awful Equity, that towre'sAbove Men's private Passions:—Tyrants die.—And Sons of Tyrants want their Father's Virtues:Then bleeds a groaning State! and Right, and RapineDescend from Heir to Heir, for ten red Ages,E're comes Another Caesar.—Hence, 'us Mercy,When One Man dies, to save the Blood of Nations.BRUTUS.Dies, Cassius!—by a SON!—Oh! righteous Heaven!Ayert the impending Horror!—Foe to Nature,Hint it no more—Or, Brutus, turns the Sword,Thou point'st at Caesar's Life—against thy own.CASSIUS,I've heard I am too hasty!—Judge me Romans:—You, who have seen the Proof, that Heaven has lent me;
Judge, to what daring Length, this rash, blind, ManProvokes his Friend's Impatience:—Let that punish thee.Gives him Caesar's Table-Book.Read there, what envied Rights thy Birth derivesFrom Caesar's Blood—who, thus, cou'd sentence Thine.BRUTUS.Reading."Wrong'd Caesar claims Redress from Curio's Sword'"Be this his Warrant for dispatching—Brutus.—If this was Caesar's, he believ'd me notHis Son.—and I have treated Truth, unkindly,CASSIUS.Yes—thou hast thank'd us well!—these Friends!—this Cassius,Who in the Grove, from Caesar's Murderers, sav'dDoom'd Portia, thy Belov'd! on Death's dire Verge.And seizing Curio, found that Warrant with him.BRUTUS.Reviewing the Warrant.By Heav'n! tis Caesar's Hand.CASSIUS,—Tis Caesar's Heart:He judg'd the Virtue, like his own-Disguise:So try'd Corruption's Power—and held out HopeOf proud Succession: Thou, if Caesar's Son.Wert Heir to Caesar's Empire.—Failing, there,He found One surer Way:—Marius, his Uncle,Had taught him, that dead Foes resist no longer.BRUTUS.Oh! it is all, too plain!—Come, Cassius! Cimber!Decimus! Casca! Cinna!—Guardian Friends?Dwell in my Bosom; share the Joy, you give:
Help me to thank the Gods, I'm once more Brutus?Oh; I cou'd play the Wanton—let loose Pleasure;—Laugh with the light: grow thoughtless, and forgetRome's Danger, for a Day—to Cherish Rapture!Now, where's the Tempest?- where's the Thunder, Now?Loud let it rend, unfear'd, the Arch of Heaven:Tis ominous, no longer:—let it roarDelightful? Brutus is no Son of Caesar!That! let it swell that Sound?—let it to Earth,Air—Heaven, and lowest Hell's lost Hope—proclaim,That Roman Brutus is not SON to Caesar.CASSIUS.Thank the kind Gods, who sav'd thee from such Horror.BRUTUS.Indulgent Heaven! were I like happier Roman's,Nature had now set free my patriot Hand,And Brutus were again, but Friend to Caesar.CASSIUS:Time calls;—the Senate waits us.BRUTUS.Stay, stay Cassius!I feel, I know not what, of Nameless Doubting,Still, hov'ring dark, and slack'ning half my Heart:Oh!

Bear offer'd Inense, thro' the Streets-of Rome;And pay their willing Worship to thy Statues.All the pleas'd City smiles.—Yet, cou'd I move thee;Cou'd thy old Soldier's first-felt Fear perswade;—Caesar shou'd shun the sad-presaging Hour,And bid this Diadem attend his Leisure.CAESAR.I thought, the Sons of Thame's had felt no Fears.TRINOVANTIUS.No Fears they feel from Earth's uniting Anger:But▪ when Heaven frowns, 'tis impious, not to tremble.All Nature, thro' her Works, seems, now, convuls'd:—I met the paliVestals, wildly screaming:Fled, from the etinuish'd Fire, robeless, and bare:And blind amidst the Dust of crumbling Towers;Shook from the dark'nd Summits!—Doors of Sepulchre'sUntouch'd, fly open: and from silent Urns,Where slept in Monumental Rest, the BonesOf Rome's first Founders, slow-ascending ShadesCatch form;—and hov'ring, in the quick'n'd Air,View some sad Fate, they want the Power to tell:And shrink, and start—and fly the sick'ning Sun.—Such boding Signs fore-note impending Fate:And Heaven, from whom Kings hold, postpones thy Claim.CAESAR.Fie Trinovantius!—'T is to bold for Man!'Tis Insolence, to list the Eternal Gods:Make Nature bus, and un-hinge a World.To lengthen, or cut short, a Mortal's Moment?Th' all-ruling Powers have fi'd our destin'd Space;And we, too weak to shun, must wait their Will.TRINOVANTIUS.
