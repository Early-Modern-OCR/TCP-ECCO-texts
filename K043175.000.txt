VAILLANT, opposite Southampton-street, in the Strand. MDCCLIX.[Price One Shilling and Six-pence.]TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOHN, Earl of BUTE, GROOM of the STOLE TO HIS Royal Highness the Prince of WALES.MY LORD,THE generous concern you were pleased to express for the anxieties of a young Author, then wholly unknown to your Lordship, and trembling for his first attempt towards the gravest, moralest, and most

profitable of all poems, as Milton calls a Tragedy, was the distinguishing mark of a mind truly great, and endued with those fine feelings which are the ornaments of even greatness itself. To this your innate partiality for every endeavour in the polite arts I must ascribe it, that the following scenes met with an early approbation from your Lordship; an approbation that was at once the author's pride, and his strongest assurance of success.The Public have indeed very far outgone my most sanguine hopes, in their reception of this piece: but now, my Lord, The Orphan has another severe trial to go through; he must adventure into the world, unassisted by the advantages of representation: he must enter your Lordship's closet, and there stand the examination of the most accurate criticism. In Meti descendat judicis aures. This cannot but be an alarming circumstance to a writer fully conscious of his own inability; who has not been able entirely to please even his own taste; who despairs of satisfying others of a more exalted

relish in the arts, and therefore craves at your Lordship's hands that protection to his industry, which he is aware cannot be granted to his merit.I have the honour to remain, with the truest respect, and most grateful acknowlegement,My Lord,Your Lordship's Most obliged, and most devoted humble servant, ARTHUR MURPHY.Lincoln's Inn, April 30, 1759.PROLOGUE.By WILLIAM WHITEHEAD, Esq POET-LAUREAT. Spoken by Mr. HOLLAND.ENOUGH of Greece and Rome. Th' exhausted storeOf either nation now can charm no more:Ev'n adventitious helps in vain we try,Our triumphs languish in the public eye;And grave processions, musically slow,Here pass unheeded,—as a Lord Mayor's shew.On eagle wings the poet of to-nightSoars for fresh virtues to the source of light,To China's eastern realms: and boldly bearsConfucius' morals to Britannia's ears.Accept th' imported boon; as ecchoing GreeceReceiv'd from wand'ring chiefs her golden fleece;Nor only richer by the spoils become,But praise th' advent'rous youth, who brings them home.One dubious character, we own, he draws,A patriot zealous in a monarch's cause!Nice is the task the varying hand to guide,And teach the blending colours to divide;Where, rainbow-like, th' encroaching tints invadeEach other's bounds, and mingle light with shade.If then, assiduous to obtain his end,You find too far the subject's zeal extend;If undistinguish'd loyalty prevailsWhere nature shrinks, and strong affection fails,On China's tenets charge the fond mistake,And spare his error for his Virtue's sake.From nobler motives our allegiance springs,For Britain knows no Right Divine in Kings;From freedom's choice that boasted right arose,And thro' each' line from freedom's choice it flows.Justice, with Mercy join'd, the throne maintains;And in his People's HEARTS OUR MONARCH reigns.EPILOGUE.Spoken by Mrs. YATES.THRO' five long acts I've wore my sighing face,Confin'd by critic laws to time and place;Yet that once done, I ramble as I please,Cry London Hoy! and whisk o'er land and seas——Ladies, excuse my dress—'tis true Chinese.Thus, quit of husband, death, and tragic strain,Let us enjoy our dear small talk again.How cou'd this hard successful hope to prove?So many heroes,—and not one in love!No suitor here to talk of flames that thrill;To say the civil thing—"Your eyes so kill!"—No ravisher, to force us—to our will!You've seen their eastern virtues, patriot passions,And now for something of their taste and fashions.O Lord! that's charming—cries my Lady Fidget,I long to know it—Do the creatures visit?Dear Mrs. Yates, do, tell us—Well, how is it?First, as to beauty—Set your hearts at rest—They're all broad foreheads, and pigs eyes at best.And then they lead such strange, such formal lives!——A little more at home than English wives:Lest the poor things shou'd roam, and prove untrue,They all are crippled in the tiney shoe.A hopeful scheme to keep a wife from madding!—We pinch our feet, and yet are ever gadding.Then they've no cards, no routs, ne'er take their fling,And pin-money is an unheard-of thing!Then how d'ye think they write?—You'll ne'er divine—From top to bottom down in one strait line.Mimicks.We ladies, when our flames we cannot smother,Write letters—from one corner to another.Mimicks.One mode there is, in which both climes agree;I scarce can tell—'Mongst friends then let it be—.—The creatures love to cheat as well as we.But bless my wits! I've quite forgot the bard—A civil soul!—By me he sends this card—"Presents respects—to ev'ry lady here—"Hopes for the honor—of a single tear."The critics then will throw their dirt in vain,One drop from you will wash out ev'ry stain.Acquaints you—(now the man is past his fright)He holds his rout,—and here he keeps his night.Assures you all a welcome kind and hearty,The ladies shall play crowns—and there's the shilling party.Points to the upper gallery.Dramatis Personae.TIMURKAN, Emperor of the Tartars, Mr. HAVARD.OCTAR, a Tartar General, Mr. BRANSBY.ZAMTI, a Mandarine, Mr. GARRICK.ETAN, educated as his Son, Mr. MOSSOP.HAMET a youthful Captive, Mr. HOLLAND.MORAT, a faithful friend of Zamti, Mr. BURTON.MIRVAN, a Chinese in the Tartar's service, secretly a friend of Zamti, Mr. DAVIES.ORASMING, Mr. PACKER.ZIMVENTI, Mr. AUSTIN.
 Two conspirators,MANDANE, Zamti's wife, Mrs. YATES.Messenger, Guards, &c.SCENE, PEKIN, Capital of CHINA.THE ORPHAN of CHINA.ACT I.Enter MANDANE and MIRVAN.MANDANE.NO, never; Mirvan, never—still this heartMust throb with ceaseless woe—All-gracious heav'n!Will not this palace drench'd in gore; the crownOf China's kings fix'd on the Tartar's brow;Will not a tract of twenty years in bondage!Ah! will not these suffice, without fresh causeOf bitter anguish in Mandane's breast?—MIRVAN.Better suppress these unavailing tears,This fruitless flood of grief.—MANDANE.It will not be—Ev'n mid'st the horrors of this dismal hour,When fate has all transferr'd from lost CathaiTo vile barbarian hands;—in such an hourThis heart, revolting from the public cause,Bleeds from a private source; bleeds for the woesThat hang o'er Zamti's house—MIRVAN.Alas! Mandane,Amidst the gen'ral wreck, who does not feelThe keen domestic pang?MANDANE.Yes, all.—We all Must feel the kindred-touch;—daily the criesOf widows, orphans, father, son, and brotherIn vain are sent to heav'n;—the wasteful rageOf these barbarians,—these accurs'd invaders,—Burns with increasing fire;—the thunder stillRolls o'er our heads, threatning with hideous crashTo fall at once, and bury us in ruin.MIRVAN.And quickly fall it must!—The hand of heav'nWeighs this great empire down.—MANDANE.Nay, tax not heav'n!Almighty justice never bares it's arm'Gainst innocence and truth.—'Tis Timurkan,That fell barbarian—that insatiate waster—May curses blast the Tartar!—he—'tis heHas bore down all, and still his slaught'ring swordIn yonder field of death, where Corea's troopsMade their last stand for liberty and China,Crimsons the land with blood.—This battle lost,Oh! then farewel to all.—But, Mirvan, say,How came the tidings?—MIRVAN.From yon lofty tow'r,As my eyes, straining tow'rd the distant plain,Sent forth an anxious look, thro' clouds of dustThe savage bands appear'd; the western sunGleam'd on their burnish'd helms;—and soon a shoutFrom the glad multitude proclaim'd th'approachOf Timurkan; elated with new conquest,The tyrant comes, and where his wrath will stopHeav'n only knows.—MANDANE.Oh! there—there lies the thoughtAt which imagination starts, appall'dWith horror at the scene▪ her busy workingsHave colour'd to my sight—there lies the thoughtThat wakens all a mother's fears—alas!I tremble for my son—MIRVAN.Your son!—kind heav'n!Have you not check'd his ardour?—with your tears,Your soft authority, restrain'd the heroFrom the alarms of war?—MANDANE.Alas, good Mirvan,Thou little know'st his danger—but that truthMust never pass these lips.—MIRVAN.I hope MandaneDoubts not my honest zeal—full well you knowI bear this tyrant deep and mortal hate;That under him I list, and wear this garbIn hopes that some occasion may arrive,When I may strike an unexpected blow,And do my country right.MANDANE.Thy loyalty,Thy truth, and honour have been ever spotless.Besides thy wrongs, thy countless wrongs, the woundsHe gave your injur'd family and name,—MIRVAN.Alas! those wounds must still lie bleeding here,Untented by the hand of time—Not allHis lenient arts, his favours heap'd upon me,Shall cool the burning anguish of my soul.What he, that slew my father! dragg'd my sister,Blooming in years, to his detested bed!Yes, tyrant, yes;—thy unextinguish'd foeDwells in this bosom.—Surely then to meMandane may reveal her griefs—her wrongsWill add new fuel to my hidden fires,And make them burn more fiercely.—MANDANE.Urge no more—My woes must rest conceal'd—yet should the tyrantLearn from the captives of yon vanquish'd host,That China's Orphan breathes the vital air,And to himself unknown within his breastUnconscious bears the gen'rous glowing flameOf all the virtues of his royal line;Oh! should they know that the dear youth survives,That for his righteous cause this war began,Their fury then would kindle to a blaze,Might wrap the world in flames, and in the ruinMy blameless son might perish.MIRVAN.Seek not thusTo multiply the ills that hover round you;Nor from the stores of busy fancy addNew shafts to fortune's quiver.—Zamti's careHath still deceiv'd suspicion's wakeful eye;
And o'er the mandarine his manners pure,And sacred function have diffus'd an airOf venerable awe, which e'en can teachThese northern foes to soften into men.MANDANE.Yes, Mirvan, yes—Religion wears a mienIn Zamti's person so severely mild,That the fierce Scythian rests upon his spear,And wonders what he feels.—Such is the charmOf heart-felt virtue; such is nature's forceThat speaks abroad, and in rude northern heartsCan stamp the image of an awful God.From that source springs some hope:—Wretch that I am!Hope idly flutters on my trembling tongue,While melancholy brooding o'er her wrongs,Lays waste the mind with horror and despair.—What noise is that?—MIRVAN.Compose this storm of grief;In ev'ry sound your fancy hears the Tartar—Your husband this way bends—MANDANE.Celestial pow'rs!What lab'ring sighs heave in his breast?—what terrorRolls in the patriot's eye?—haste, Mirvan, hence;Again look out; gather the flying news,And let me know each circumstance of ruin.Exit Mirvan.Enter ZAMTI.MANDANE.Zamti!ZAMTI.Mandane!—MANDANE.Ah! what hast thou seen?What hast thou heard?—tell me,—has fate decreedThe doom of China!ZAMTI.China is no more;—The eastern world is lost—this mighty empireFalls with the universe beneath the strokeOf savage force—falls from its tow'ring hopes;For ever, ever fall'n!MANDANE.Yet why, ye pow'rs!Why should a tyrant, train'd to lust and murder,A lawless ravager from savage wilds,Where chearful day ne'er dawns, but low'ring heav'nFor ever rolls a turbulence of clouds;Why should a monster thus usurp the world,And trample fair simplicity from illBeneath his ruffian feet?—ZAMTI.Far hence, Mandane,Those happy days, alas! are fled, when peaceHere nurs'd her blooming olives, and shed roundHer fost'ring influence.—In vain the planOf sacred laws, by hoary elders taught,Laws founded on the base of public weal,Gave lessons to the world.—In vain ConfuciusUnlock'd his radiant stores of moral truth;In vain bright science, and each tender muse,Beam'd ev'ry elegance on polish'd life—Barbarian pow'r prevails.—Whate'er our sages taught,Or genius could inspire, must fade away,And each fair virtue wither at the blastOf northern domination.MANDANE.Fatal day!More fatal e'en than that, which first beheldThis race accurs'd within these palace walls,Since hope, that balm of wretched minds, is nowIrrevocably lost.—ZAMTI.Name not the dayWhich saw this city sack'd—fresh stream my eyes,Fresh bleeds my heart, whene'er the sad ideaComes o'er my tortur'd mind.—Why, cruel pow'rs!Why in that moment could not Zamti fall?MANDANE.Thy sanctity, the symbol of thy God,Made ev'n the conqueror suspend his blow,And murmur soft humanity.—High heav'nProtected thee for its own great designs;To save the royal child, the new-born babe,From the dire slaughter of his ancient line.ZAMTI.Yes, my Mandane, in that hour of carnage,For purposes yet in the womb of time,I was reserv'd.—I was ordain'd to saveThe infant boy; the dear, the precious charge,The last of all my kings;—full twenty yearsI've hid him from the world and from himself,And now I swear—Kneel we together here,While in this dreadful pause our souls renewTheir solemn purpose.—Both kneel.Thou all-gracious Being,Whose tutelary care hath watch'd the fateOf China's Orphan, who hast taught his stepsThe paths of safety, still envelop himIn sev'n fold night, till your own hour is come;Till your flow justice see the dread occasionTo rouse his soul, and bid him walk abroad
Vicegerent of your pow'r;—and if thy servant,Or this his soft associate, ere defeatBy any word or deed the great design,Then strait may all your horrible displeasureBe launch'd upon us from your red right arm,And in one ruin dash us both together,The blasted monuments of wrath:—MANDANE.That hereMandane vows ne'er to betray his cause,Be it enroll'd in the records of heav'n!Both rise.ZAMTI.And now my heart more lightly beats; methinksWith strength redoubled I can meet the shockOf adverse fate.MANDANE.And lo! the trial comes—For see where Etan mourns—See where the youth,Unknowing of the storm that gathers o'er him,Brings some new tale of woe.—Enter ETAN.ETAN.My honour'd father,And you, my helpless mother,—ah! where now,Illustrious wretched pair, where will ye fly?Where will your miseries now find a shelter?ZAMTI.In virtue—I and this dear faithful woman,We ask no more.—MANDANE.Ah! quickly, Etan, sayWhat means that pallid look?—what new eventBrings on the work of fate?—ZAMTI.Say, does the tyrantReturn unglutted yet with blood?—ETAN.He does;Ev'n now his triumph moves within the gatesIn dread barbaric pomp:—the iron swarmsOf Hyperboreans troop along the streets,Reeking from slaughter; while, from gazing crowdsOf their dire countrymen, an uproar wildOf joy ferocious thro' th' astonish'd airHowls like a northern tempest:—O'er the rest,Proud in superior eminence of guilt,The tyrant rides sublime.—Behind his carThe refuse of the sword, a captive trainDisplay their honest scars, and gnash their teethWith rage and desperation.—MANDANE.Cruel fate!ETAN.With these a youth, distinguish'd from the rest,Proceeds in sullen march.—Heroic fireGlows in his cheek, and from his flashing eyeBeams amiable horror.—MANDANE.What of this youth?—ZAMTI.Be not alarm'd, Mandane—What of him?ETAN.On him all eyes were fix'd with eager gaze,As if their spirits, struggling to come forth,Would strain each visual nerve,—while thro' the crowdA busy murmur ran—If same say right,"Beneath that habit lurks a prince; the last
"Of China's race.—The rumour spreads abroadFrom man to man; and all with loud acclaimDenounce their vengeance on him.—MANDANE.Ha! what say'st thou, Etan?Heav'ns how each black'ning hour in deeper horrorComes charg'd with woe!ZAMTI.It cannot be.—Ye vain,Ye groundless terrors hence.—Aside.MANDANE.My honour'd lord,Those eyes upturn'd to heav'n, alas! in vain,Declare your inward conflict.—ZAMTI.Lov'd Mandane,I prithee leave me—but a moment leave me.—Heed not the workings of a sickly fancy,Wrought on by ev'ry popular report.Thou know'st with Morat I convey'd the infantFar as the eastern point of Corea's realm;There where no human trace is seen, no foundAssails the ear, save when the foaming surgeBreaks on the shelving beach, that there the youthMight mock their busy search.—Then check thy fears—Retire, my love, awhile; I'll come anon,—And fortify thy soul with firm resolve,Becoming Zamti's wife.—MANDANE.Yes, Zamti's wifeShall never act unworthy of her lord.Then hence I'll go, and satisfy each doubtThis youthful captive raises in my heart,
Quick panting with its fears.—And O ye pow'rs!Protect my son, my husband, and my king!Exit Mandane.ZAMTI and ETAN.ZAMTI.Come hither, Etan—thou perceiv'st the toilsThat now incircle me—ETAN.Alas! too wellI see th'impending storm.—But surely, sir,Should this young captive prove the royal Orphan,You'll never own th'important truth.—ZAMTI.Dream not, young man,To stand secure, yet blooming into life,While vengeance hovers o'er your father's head.The stock once fall'n, each scyon must decay.ETAN.Then let me perish;—witness for me, heav'n,Could Etan's fall appease the tyrant's wrath,A willing victim he would yield his life,And ask no greater boon of heav'n.ZAMTI.This zealSo fervid in a stranger's cause—ETAN.A stranger! he!My king a stranger!—Sir, you never meant it—Perhaps you would explore the fiery seedsOf Etan's temper, ever prompt to blazeAt honour's sacred name.—Perish the man,Who, when his country calls him to defendThe rights of human kind, or bravely die,
Who then to glory dead can shrink aghast,And hold a council with his abject fears.ZAMTI.These tow'rings of the soul, alas! are vain.I know the Tartar well—should I attemptBy any virtuous fraud to veil the truth,His lion-rage again shall stalk abroad,Again shall quaff the blood of innocence;And for Zaphimri all the poor remainsOf China's matrons and her hoary fires,Her blooming virgins, and her lisping babes,Shall yield their throats to the fell murd'rer's knife,And all be lost for ever—ETAN.Then at onceProclaim him to the world; each honest handWill grasp a sword, and, 'midst the circling guards,Reach the usurper's heart—or should they fail,Should overwhelming bands obstruct the deed,They'll greatly dare to die!—better to dieWith falling liberty, than basely leadAn ignominious life.—Zaphimri lost,Ne'er shall fair order dawn, but thro' the landSlav'ry shall clank her chains, and violation,Rapine, and murder riot at the willOf lust and lawless pow'r.ZAMTI.Thou brave young man,Indulge my fond embrace—thy lovely ardorIt glads me thus to see.—To ease at onceThy gen'rous fears,—the prince Zaphimri's safe;Safe in my guardian care—ETAN.This pris'ner, sir,He does not then alarm you?—ZAMTI.No! from thenceI've nought to fear.—ETAN.Oh! sir, inform your sonWhere is the royal youth?ZAMTI.Seek not too soonTo know that truth—now I'll disclose the work,The work of vengeance, which my lab'ring soulHas long been fashioning.—Ev'n at this hourStupendous ruin hovers o'er the headsOf this accursed race—ETAN.Ruin!ZAMTI.I'll tell thee—When Timurkan led forth his savage bands,Unpeopling this great city, I then seiz'dThe hour, to tamper with a chosen few,Who have resolv'd, when the barbarians lieBuried in sleep and wine, and hotly dreamTheir havock o'er again,—then, then, my son,In one collected blow to burst upon 'em;Like their own northern clouds, whose midnight horrorImpending o'er the world, at length breaks forthIn the vaunt lightning's blaze, in storms and thunderThro' all the red'ning air, till frighted natureStart from her couch, and waken to a sceneOf uproar and destruction.—ETAN.Oh! my Father,The glorious enterprize!ZAMTI.Mark me, young man.—Seek thou my friends, Orasming and Zimventi.In the dim holy cloisters of yon templeThou'lt find them musing—near Osmingti's tombI charge they all convene; and there do thouAwait my coming.—Bid them ne'er remitTheir high heroic ardor;—let them know,Whate'er shall fall on this old mould'ring clay,The tyrant never shall subdue my mind.End of the First ACT.ACT II.Enter ZAMTI.ZAMTI.DREAM on, deluded tyrant; yes, dream onIn blind security:—whene'er high heav'nMeans to destroy, it curses with illusion,With error of the mind.—Yes, wreak thy furyUpon this captive youth;—whoe'er he is,If from his death this groaning empire rise,Once more itself, resplendent, rich in artsThat humanize the world,—he pays a debtDue to his King, his Country, and his God.His father,—wheresoe'er he dwell,—in tearsShall tell the glory on his boy deriv'd;And ev'n his mother, 'midst her matron shrieks,Shall bless the childbed pang that brought him forthTo this great lot, by fate to few allow'd!—What would'st thou, Mirvan?—Enter MIRVAN.MIRVAN.Eagerly without,A rev'rend stranger craves access to Zamti—His head hoary with age, with galling tearsHis eyes suffus'd; his ev'ry look impatience—ZAMTI.Give him admittance—Exit Mirvan.How my spirits rush
Tumultuous to, my heart—what may this mean?Lo! where he comes—Enter MORAT.MORAT.Zamti!—ZAMTI.Ha!—thro' the veilOf age,—that face—that mien—Morat!MORAT.Oh! Zamti,Let me once more embrace thee—ZAMTI.Good old man!They embrace.But wherefore art thou here?—what of my boy?MORAT.Ah! what indeed?—Ev'n from the ocean's margin,Parch'd with the sun, or chill'd with midnight damps,O'er hills, and rocks, and dreary continents,In vain I've follow'd—ZAMTI.Why didst let him forth?MORAT.Think not thy Morat urg'd him to the deed.His valour was the cause; and soon as fameProclaim'd the prince alive, the mighty dinOf preparation through all Corea's realmAlarm'd his breast—Indignant of controulHe burst his covert, and now, hapless youth—ZAMTI.Ah!—dead!—in battle fall'n!—MORAT.Alas! ev'n nowHe drags the conqu'ror's chain.—ZAMTI.Mandane thenMay still embrace her son.—My boy may live,To know the sweets of freedom, e'er he die.MORAT.Alas! the measure of your woes is full.Unconscious of our frauds, the tyrant thinksThe prince his pris'ner in your son.—ZAMTI.Ah!—Morat!MORAT.Wild thro' the streets the foe calls out on Zamti.Thee they pronounce the author of this fraud;And on your Hamet threaten instant vengeance.ZAMTI.There was but this—but this, ye cruel pow'rs,And this you've heap'd upon me.—Was it notEnough to tear him from his mother's arms,Doom'd for his prince to wander o'er the world?—Alas! what needed more?—Fond foolish eyes,Stop your unbidden'gush—tear, tear me piecemeal—No, I will not complain—but whence on himCould that suspicion glance?—MORAT.This very morn,E'er yet the battle join'd, a faithful messenger,Who thro' the friendly gloom of night had heldHis darkling way, and pass'd the Tartar's camp,Brought me advices from the Corean chief,—That soon as Hamet join'd the warlike train,His story he related.—Strait the gallant leader
With open arms receiv'd him—knew him for thy son,In secret knew him, nor reveal'd he aughtThat touch'd his birth.—But still the busy voiceOf fame, encreasing as she goes, through all the ranksBabbled abroad each circumstance.—By theeHow he was privately convey'd—Sent forthA tender infant to be rear'd in solitude,A stranger to himself!—The warriors sawWith what a graceful port he mov'd in arms,An early hero!—deem'd him far aboveThe common lot of life—deem'd him Zaphimri,And all with reverential awe beheld him.This, this, my Zamti, reach'd the tyrant's ear,And rises into horrid proof.—ZAMTI.If so,Oh! what a sacrifice must now be made!Aside.MORAT.But when the secret shall be known—ZAMTI.Oh! Morat!Does thy poor bleeding country still remainDear to thy heart?—Say, dost thou still revereThat holy pow'r above, Supreme of Beings,Mistaken by the Bonzée, whom our fathersWorshipp'd in happier days!—MORAT.He,—only heFor twenty years hath giv'n me strength in exile.ZAMTI.Then bending here, before, his awful throne,Swear what I now unfold, shall ever lieIn sacred silence wrapp'd.—MORAT.I swear!—ZAMIT.Now mark me—Morat—my son— (turning aside.) Oh! cruel, cruel task,To conquer nature while the heart-strings break;—MORAT.Why heave those sighs?—and why that burst of grief?ZAMTI.My son—his guiltless blood—I cannot speak—Bursts into tears.MORAT.Ha!—Wilt thou shed his blood?—ZAMTI.Thou wretched father!—Half aside.MORAT.Oh! had you known the virtues of the youth;His truth, his courage, his enlighten'd mind—ZAMTI.I prithee urge no more—here nature's voiceSpeaks in such pleadings:—Such reproaches, Morat,—Here in my very heart—gives woundings here,Thou can'st not know—and only parents feel—MORAT.And wilt thou, cruel in thy tears—ZAMTI.Nay cease,In pity to a father cease—Think, Morat,Think of Zaphimri—MORAT.Ah! how fares the prince?ZAMIT.He fares, my Morat, like a God on earth,Unknowing his celestial origin:Yet quick, intense, and bursting into action;His great heart labr'ing with he knows not whatProdigious deeds!—Deeds, which e'er long shall rouze,Astonish, and alarm the world.—MORAT.What meanThose mystic sounds?ZAMT.Revenge, conquest, and freedom!—MORAT.Conquest and freedom!ZAMTI.Ay!—Conquest and freedom!The midnight hour shall call a chosen bandOf hidden patriots forth; who, when the foeSinks down in drunken revelry, shall pourThe gather'd rage of twenty years upon him,And vindicate the eastern world.—MORAT.Oh! Zamti,The news revives my soul.—ZAMTI.And can'st thou thinkTo save one vulgar life, that Zamti nowWill marr the vast design?—No;—let him bleed,Let my boy bleed:—In such a cause as thisI can resign my son—with tears of joy Resignhim,—and one complicated pangShall wrench him from my heart.—The conqu'ror comes!Warlike music within.
This is no hour for parlying—Morat, hence,And leave me to my fix'd resolve.—MORAT.Yet think,Think of some means to save your Hamet.—ZAMTI.Oh!It cannot be—the soul of TimurkanIs bold and stirring—when occasion calls,He springs aloft, like an expanding fire,And marks his way with ruin.—Now he knowsZaphimri lives, his fear will make him daringBeyond his former crimes—for joy and riotWhich this day's triumph brings, remorseless rageAnd massacre succeed—and all our hopesAre blasted, for an unimportant boy.A second flourish.MORAT.That nearer sound proclaims his dread approach—Yet once more, Zamti, think—ZAMTI.No more—I'll sendThose shall conduct thee where Orasming lives—There dwell, unseen of all.—But, Morat, firstSeek my Mandane.—Heav'ns!—how shall I bearHer strong impetuosity of grief,When she shall know my fatal purpose?—ThouPrepare her tender spirit; sooth her mind,And save, oh! save me from that dreadful conflict.Exeunt.Two large Folding-gates in the Back-scene are burst open by the Tartars, and then enter TIMURKAN, with his Train.TIMURKAN.Hail to this regal dome, this glitt'ring palace!Where this inventive race have lavish'd allTheir elegance—ye gay apartments, hail!Beneath your storied roof, where mimic lifeGlows the eye, and at the painter's touchA new creation lives along the walls;Once more receive a conqueror, arriv'dFrom rougher scenes, where stern rebellion dar'd Drawforth his phalanx; till this warlike armHurl'd desolation on his falling ranks,And now the monster, in yon field of death,Lies overwhelm'd in ruin.—OCTAR.There he fell,No more to stalk thy realm; the eastern worldFrom this auspicious day, beneath your feetLies bound in adamantine chains.—TIMURKAN.Thus Octar,Shall Timurkan display his conqu'ring banners,From high Samarcand's walls, to where the TanaisDevolves his icy tribute to the sea.—OCTAR.But first this captive prince.—TIMURKAN.Yes, Octar, firstZaphimri gluts my rage—bring him before us—first;We'll crush the seeds of dark conspiracy—For Zamti—he, that false insidious slave,Shall dearly pay his treasons.—OCTAR.Zamti's crimes'Twere best to leave unpanish'd:—vers'd in wilesOf sly hypocrisy, he wins the loveOf the deluded multitude.—'Twould seem,Should we inflict that death his frauds deserve,As if we meant destruction to their faith:When a whole people's minds are once inflam'dFor their religious rights, their fury burnsWith rage more dreadful, as the source is holy.—TIMURKAN.Octar, thou reason'st right:—henceforth my artTo make this stubborn race receive my yoke,Shall be by yielding to their softer manners,Their vesture, laws, and customs: thus to blendAnd make the whole one undistinguish'd people.The boy comes forth in sullen mood—what passionsSwell in his breast in vain!—Enter HAMET in chains.TIMURKAN.Thou art the youth,Who mow'd our battle down, and flesh'd your swordIn many a slaughter'd Tartar.—HAMET.True;—I am.—TIMURKAN.Too well I mark'd thy rage, and saw thee hewA wasteful passage thro' th'embattled plain.HAMET.Then be thou witness for me, in that hourI never shunn'd your thickest war;—and ifIn yonder field, where my poor countrymenIn mangled heaps lie many a rood extended,Kind fate had doom'd me to a noble fall,With this right arm I earn'd it.—TIMURKAN.Say, what motiveUnsheath'd thy rebel blade, and bad thee seekThese wars?—HAMET.The love of honourable deeds;The groans of bleeding China, and the hateOf tyrants.TIMURKAN.Ha!—take heed, rash youth—I seeThis lesson has been taught thee.—Octar, haste,Seek me the mandarine—let him forthwithAttend me here. (Exit Octar.)—Now tremble at my words!Thy motive to these wars is known—thou artZaphimri.—HAMET.I Zaphimri!TIMURKAN.False one, yes;Thou art Zaphimri—thou!—whom treach'rous guileStole from my rage, and sent to distant wilds,Till years and horrid counsel should mature theeFor war and wild commotion.—HAMET.I the prince!The last of China's race! nay mock not majesty,Nor with the borrow'd robes of sacred kingsDress up a wretch like me—were I Zaphimri,Think'st thou thy trembling eye could bear the shockOf a much injur'd king?—could'st thou sustain it?Say, could'st thou bear to view a royal orphan,Whose father, mother, brothers, sisters, all,Thy murd'rous arm hath long since laid in dust?Whose native crown on thy ignoble browThou dar'st dishonour?—whose wide wasted countryThy arms have made a wilderness?—TIMURKAN.I seeThou hast been tutor'd in thy lone retreatBy some sententious pedant.—Soon these vain,These turgid maxims shall be all subduedBy thy approaching death.—HAMET.Let death come on;Guilt, guilt alone shrinks back appall'd—the braveAnd honest still defy his dare; the wiseCalmly can eye his frown;—and miseryInvokes his friendly aid to end her woes.—TIMURKAN.Thy woes, presumptuous youth, with all my fears,Shall soon lie buried.—Enter ZAMTI.TIMURKAN.Now, pious false one, say, who is that youth?ZAMTI.His air, his features, and his honest mienProclaim all fair within.—But, mighty sir,I know him not.—TIMURKAN.Take heed, old man, nor dare, As thou do'st dread my pow'r, to practice guile Beneath a mask of sacerdotal perfidy: Priestcraft, I think, calls it a pious fraud.ZAMTI.Priestcraft and sacerdotal perfidy To me are yet unknown.—Religion's garb Here never serves to consecrate a crime; We have not yet, thank heav'n, so far imbib'd The vices of the north.—TIMURKAN.Thou vile impostor!A vow Zaphimri, whom thy treach'rous artsConceal'd from justice; or else desolationAgain shall ravage this devoted land.ZAMTI.Alas! full well thou know'st, that arm alreadyHath shed all royal blood.—TIMURKAN.Traitor, 'tis false;—By thee, vile slave, I have been wrought to thinkThe hated race destroy'd—thy artful taleAbus'd my cred'lous ear.—But know, at lengthSome captive slaves, by my command impal'd,Have own'd the horrid truth;—have own'd they foughtTo feat Zaphimri on the throne of China.Hear me, thou froward boy;—dar'st thou be honest,And answer who thou art?—HAMET.Dare I be honest?—I dare;—a mind grown up in native honourDares not be otherwise—then if thy troopsAsk from the lightning of whose blade they fled,Tell 'em 'twas Harriet's.—ZAMTI.'Tis—it is my son—My boy,—my Hamet—Aside.TIMURKAN.Where was your abode?—HAMET.Far hence remote, in Corea's happy realm—Where the first beams of day with orient blushesTinge the fait wave—there on the sea beat shore
A cavern'd rock yielded a lone retreatTo virtuous Morat.—ZAMTI.Oh! ill-fated youth!Aside.HAMET.The pious hermit in that moss-grown dwellingFound an asylum from heart-piercing woes,From slav'ry, and that restless din of armsWith which thy fell ambition shook the world.There too the sage nurtur'd my greener years;With him and contemplation have I walk'dThe paths of wisdom; what the great ConfuciusOf moral beauty taught,—whate'er the wise,Still wooing knowlege in her secret haunts,Disclos'd of nature to the sons of men,My wond'ring mind has heard—but above allThe hermit taught me the most useful science,That noble science, to be Brave and. Good.—ZAMTI.Oh! lovely youth—at ev'ry word he utters,A soft effusion mix'd of grief and joyFlows o'er my heart.Aside.TIMURKAN.Who, said he, was your father?HAMETMy birth, the pious sage,—I know not why—Still wrapp'd in silence; and when urg'd to tell,He only answer'd that a time might come,I should not blush to know my father.—TIMURKAN.Now,With truth declare, hast thou ne'er heard of Zamti?HAMET.Of Zamti?—oft enraptur'd with his name
My heart has glow'd within me, as I heardThe praises of the godlike man.—TIMURKAN.Thou slave,To Zamti.Each circumstance arraigns thy guilt.—HAMET.Oh! heav'ns! Can that be Zamti?TIMURKAN.Yes, that is the traitor—HAMET.Let me adore his venerable form,Thus on my knees adore—ZAMTI.I cannot look upon him,Left tenderness dissolve my feeble pow'rs,And wrest my purpose from me—Aside.TIMURKAN.Hence, vain boy!Thou specious traitor, thou false hoary moralist!To Zamti.Confusion has o'erta'en thy subtle frauds.To make my crown's assurance firm, that noneHereafter shall aspire to wrench it from me,Now own your fancied king; or, by yon heav'n,To make our vengeance sure, thro' all the eastEach youth shall die, and carnage thin mankind,Till in the gen'ral wreck your boasted OrphanShall undistinguish'd fall.—Thou know'st my wordIs fate.—Octar, draw near—when treason lurksEach moment's big with danger—thou observeThese my commands—Talks apart to Octar.ZAMTI.Now virtuous cruelty repress my tears.—Cease your soft conflict, nature.—Hear me, Tartar.—That youth—his air—his ev'ry look, unmans me quite.—TIMURKAN.Wilt thou begin, dissembler?ZAMTI.Down, down, down—It must be so, or all is lost—That youth,—I've dealt by him—as ev'ry king could wishIn a like case his faithful subjects would.TIMURKAN.Ha!—dost thou own it?—Triumph, Timurkan,And in Zaphimri's grave lie hush'd my fears.Brave Octar, let the victim strait be ledTo yonder sacred fane; there, in the viewOf my rejoicing Tartars, the declining funShall see him offer'd to our living Lama,For this day's conquest:—thence a golden trainOf radiant years, shall mark my future sway.Exit.ZAMTI.Flow, flow my tears, and ease this aching breast.HAMET.Nay, do not weep for me, thou good old man.If it will close the wounds of bleeding China,That a poor wretch like me must yield his life,I give it freely.—If I am a king,Tho' sure it cannot be, what greater blessingCan a young prince enjoy, than to diffuse,By one great act, that happiness on millions,For which his life should be a round of care?Come, lead me to my fate.—Exit with Octar, &c.ZAMTI.Hold, hold my heart!—My gallant, gen'rous youth!—Mandane's air,His mother's dear resemblance rives my soul.MANDANE within.Oh! let me fly, and find the barb'rous man—Where—where is Zamti?—ZAMTI.Ha!—'tis Mandane—Wild as the winds, the mother all aliveIn ev'ry heartstring, the forlorn one comesTo claim her boy.—Enter MANDANE.MANDANE.And can It then be true?Is human nature exil'd from thy breast?Art thou, indeed, so barb'rous?—ZAMTI.Lov'd Mandane,Fix not your scorpions here—a bearded shaftAlready drinks my spirits up.—MANDANE.I've seen'The trusty Morat—Oh! I've heard it all.—He would have shunn'd my steps; but what can 'scapeThe eye of tenderness like mine?—ZAMTI.By heav'nI cannot speak to thee.—MANDANE.Think'st thou those tears,Those false, those cruel tears, will choak the voice
Of a fond mother's love, How stung to madness?Oh! I will rend the air with lamentations,Root up this hair, and beat this throbbing breast,Turn all connubial joys to bitterness,To fell despair, to anguish and remorse,Unless my son—ZAMTI.Thou ever faithful woman,Oh! leave me to my woes.—MANDANE.Give me my child,Thou worse than Tartar, give me back my son;Oh! give him to a mother's eager arms,And let me strain him to my heart.—ZAMTI.Heav'n knowsHow dear my boy is here:—But our first dutyNow claims attention—to our country's love,All other tender fondnesses must yeild;—I was a subject e'er I was a father.MANDANE.You were a savage bred in Scythian wilds,And humanizing pity never reach'dYour heart.—Was it for this—oh! thou unkind one,Was it for this—oh! thou inhuman father,You woo'd me to your nuptial bed?—So longHave I then clasp'd thee in these circling arms,And made this breast your pillow?—Cruel, say.Are these your vows?—are these your fond endearments?Nay, look upon me—if this wasted form,These faded eyes have turn'd your heart against me,With grief for you I wither'd in my bloom.ZAMTI.Why with them pierce my heart?MANDANE.Alas! my son,Have I then bore thee in these matron arms,To see thee bleed?—Thus dost thou then return?This could your mother hope, when first she sentHer infant exile to a distant clime?Ah! could I think thy early love of fame,Would urge thee to this peril?—thus to fall,By a stern father's will—by thee to die!—From thee, inhuman, to receive his doom!——Murder'd by thee!—Yet hear me, Zamti, hear me—Thus on my knees—I threaten now no more—'Tis nature's voice that pleads; nature alarm'd,Quick, trembling, wild, touch'd to her inmost feeling,When force would tear her tender young ones from her.ZAMTI.Nay, seek not with enfeebling fond ideasTo swell the flood of grief—it is in vain—He must submit to fate.—MANDANE.Barbarian! no—She rises hastily.He shall not die—rather—I prithee, Zamti,Urge not a grief-distracted woman:—TrembleAt the wild fury of a mother's love.ZAMTI.I tremble rather at a breach of oaths.But thou break thine.—Bathe your perfidious handsIn this life blood.—Betray the righteous causeOf all our sacred kings.MANDANE.Our kings!—our kings!What are the scepter'd rulers of the world?—Form'd of one common clay, are they not allDoom'd with each subject, with the meanest slave,
To drink the cup of human woe?—alikeAll levell'd by affliction?—Sacred kings!'Tis human policy sets up their claim.—Mine is a mother's cause—mine is the causeOf husband, wife, and child;—those tend'rest ties!Superior to your right divine of kings!—ZAMTI.Then go, Mandane—thou once faithful woman,Dear to this heart in vain;—go, and forgetThose virtuous lessons, which I oft have taught thee,In fond credulity, while on each wordYou hung enamour'd.—Go, to TimurkanReveal the awful truth.—Be thou spectatressOf murder'd majesty.—Embrace your son,And let him lead in shame and servitudeA life ignobly bought.—Then let those eyes,Those faded eyes, which grief for me hath dimm'd,With guilty joy reanimate their lustre,To brighten slavery, and beam their firesOn the fell Scythian murderer.MANDANE.And is it thus,Thus is Mandane known?—My soul disdainsThe vile imputed guilt.—No—never—never—Still am I true to fame. Come lead me hence,Where I may lay down life to save Zaphimri,—But save my Hamet too.—Then, then you'll findA heart beats here, as warm and great as thine.ZAMTI.Then make with me one strong, one glorious effort;And rank with those, who, from the first of time,In fame's eternal archives stand rever'd,For conqu'ring all the dearest ties of nature,To serve the gen'ral weal.—MANDANE.That savage virtueLoses with me its horrid charms.—I've swornTo save my king.—But should a mother turnA dire assassin—oh! I cannot bearThe piercing thought.—Distraction, quick distractionWill seize my brain.—See there—My child, my child,—By guards surrounded, a devoted victim.—Barbarian hold!—Ah! see, he dies! he dies!—She faints into Zamti's arms.ZAMTI.Where is Arsace?—Fond maternal loveShakes her weak frame— (Enter Arsace.) Quickly, Arsace, helpThis ever-tender creature.—Wand'ring lifeRekindles in her cheek.—Soft, lead her offTo where the fanning breeze in yonder bow'r,May woo her spirits back.—Propitious heav'n?Pity the woundings of a father's heart;Pity my strugglings with this best of women;Support our virtue:—kindle in our soulsA ray of your divine enthusiasm;Such as inflames the patriot's breast, and liftsTh' impassion'd mind to that sublime of virtue,That even on the rack it feels the good,Which in a single hour it works for millions,And leaves the legacy to after times.Exit, leading off Mandane.End of the Second ACT.ACT III.SCENE A Temple. Several tombs up and down the stage.Enter MORAT.THIS is the place—these the long winding isles,The solemn arches, whose religious aweAttunes the mind to melancholy musing,Such as befits free men reduc'd to slaves.—Here Zamti meets his friends—amid these tombs,Where lie the sacred manes of our kings,They pour their orisons—hold converse hereWith the illustrious shades of murder'd heroes,And meditate a great revenge— (a groan is heard) a groan!The burst of anguish from some care-worn wretchThat sorrows o'er his country—ha! 'tis Zamti!ZAMTI comes out of a tomb.ZAMTI.Who's he, that seeks these mansions of the dead?MORAT.The friend of Zamti and of China.—ZAMTI.Morat!Come to my arms, thou good, thou best of men—I have been weeping o'er the sacred reliques
Of a dear murder'd king—where are our friends?Hast seen Orasming?MORAT.Thro' these vaults of deathLonely he wanders,—plung'd in deep despair.—ZAMTI.Hast thou not told him?—hast thou nought reveal'dTouching Zaphimri?MORAT.There I wait thy will—ZAMTI.Oh! thou art ever faithful—on thy lipsSits pensive silence, with her hallow'd fingerGuarding the pure recesses of thy mind.—But, lo! they come.—Enter ORASMING, ZIMVENTI, and others.ZAMTI.Droop ye, my gallant friends?ORASMING.Oh! Zamti, all is lost—Our dreams of libertyAre vanish'd into air.—Nought now availsIntegrity of life.—Ev'n heav'n, combin'dWith lawless might, abandons us and virtue—ZAMTI.Can your great souls thus shrink within ye? thusFrom heroes will ye dwindle into slaves?ORASMING.Oh! could you give us back Zaphimri!—thenDanger would smile, and lose its face of horror.ZAMTI.What,—would his presence fire ye!ORASMING.'Twould by heav'n!ZIMVENTI.This night should free us from the Tartar's yoke.ZAMTI.Then mark the care of the all-gracious Gods!This youthful captive, whom in chains they hold,Is not Zaphimri.—ORASMING, ZIMVENTI.Not Zaphimri!ZAMTI.No!Unconscious of himself, and to the world unknown,He walks at large among us—ORASMING.Heav'nly pow'rs!ZAMTI.This night, my friends, this very night to riseRefulgent from a blow, that frees us all,—From the usurper's fate!—the first of men,Deliv'rer of his country!ORASMING.Mighty Gods!Can this be possible?—ZAMTI.It is most true—I'll bring him to ye strait— (calling to Etan within the tomb) what ho!—come forth—You seem transfix'd with wonder—oh! my friends,Watch all the motions of your rising spirit,Direct your ardor, when anon ye hearWhat fate, long pregnant with the vast event,Is lab'ring into birth.—
ETAN comes out of the tomb.ETAN.Each step I moveA deeper horror sits on all the tombs;Each shrine,—each altar seems to shake; as ifConscious of some important crisis.—ZAMTI.Yes;A crisis great indeed, is now at hand!—Heav'n holds its golden balance forth, and weighsZaphimri's and the Tartar's destiny,While hov'ring angels tremble round the beam.Hast thou beheld that picture?ETAN.Fix'd attentionHath paus'd on ev'ry part; yet still to meIt shadows forth the forms of things unknown;—All imag'ry obscure, and wrapp'd in darkness.ZAMTI.That darkness my informing breath shall clear,As morn dispels the night. Lo! here display'dThis mighty kingdom's fall.—ETAN.Alas! my father,At sight of these sad colourings of woe,Our tears will mix with honest indignation.ZAMTI.Nay, but survey it closer—see that child,That royal infant, the last sacred relictOf China's ancient line—see where a mandarineConveys the babe to his wife's fost'ring breast,There to be nourish'd in an humble state;While their own son is sent to climes remote;That, should the dire usurper e'er suspect
The prince alive, he in his stead might bleed,And mock the murd'rer's rage.—ETAN.Amazement thrillsThro' all my frame, and my mind, big with wonder,Feels ev'ry pow'r suspended.—ZAMTI.Rather sayThat strong imagination burns within thee.—Do'st thou not feel a more than common ardor?—ETAN.By heav'n my soul dilates with some new impulse;Some strange inspir'd emotion—would the hourOf fate were come—this night my dagger's hiltI'll bury in the tyrant's heart.—ZAMTI.Wilt thou?ETAN.By all the mighty dead, that round us lie,By all who this day groan in chains, I will.ZAMTI.And when thou dost—then tell him 'tis the princeThat strikes.—ETAN.The prince's wrongs shall nerve my armWith tenfold rage.ZAMTI.Nay, but the prince himself!ETAN.What says my father?—ZAMTI.Thou art China's Orphan;The last of all our kings—no longer Etan,But now Zaphimri!ZAPHIMRI.Ha!ORASMING.O wond'rous hand Of heav'n!ZAPHIMRI.A crow'd of circumstances rise—Thy frequent hints obscure—thy pious careTo train my youth to greatness.—Lend your aidTo my astonish'd pow'rs, that feebly bearThis unexpected shock of royalty.ZAMTI.Thou noble youth, now put forth all your strength,And let heav'n's vengeance brace each sinew.—ZAPHIMRI.Vengeance!—That word has shot its light'ning thro' my soul.—But tell me, Zamti—still 'tis wonder all—Am I indeed the Royal Orphan?—ZAMTI.Thou;—Thou art the king, whom as my humble son,I've nurtur'd in humanity and virtue.Thy foes could never think to find thee here,Ev'n in the lion's den; and therefore hereI've fix'd thy safe asylum, while my sonHath dragg'd his life in exile.—Oh! my friends,Morat will tell ye all,—each circumstance—Mean time—there is your king!—All kneel to him.ORASMING, ZIMVENTI.Long live the Father of the eastern world!ZAMTI.Sole governor of earth!—ZAPHIMRI.All-ruling pow'rs!—Is then a great revenge for all the wrongsOf bleeding China; are the fame and fateOf all posterity included hereWithin my bosom?—They all rise.ZAMTI.Yes; they are; the shadesOf your great ancestors now rise before thee,Heroes and demi-gods!—Aloud they callFor the fell Tartar's blood—.ZAPHIMRI.Oh! Zamti; allThat can alarm the pow'rs of man, now stirsIn this expanding breast.—ZAMTI.Anon to burstWith hideous ruin on the foe.—My gallant heroes,Are our men station'd at their posts?ORASMING.They are.—ZAMTI.Is ev'ry gate secur'd?ORASMING.All safe.—ZAMTI.The signal fix'd?—ORASMING.It is:—Will Mirvan join us?ZAMTI.Doubt him not.—In bitterness of soul he counts his wrongs,And pants for vengeance—would have join'd us here,
But, favour'd as he is, his post requires himAbout the Tartar's person.—The assault begun,He'll turn his arms upon th' astonish'd foe,And add new horrors to the wild commotion.ZAPHIMRI.Now, bloody spoiler, now thy hour draws nigh,And e'er the dawn thy guilty reign shall end.ZAMTI.How my heart burns within me!—Oh! my friends,Call now to mind the scene of desolation,Which Timurkan, in one accursed hour,Heap'd on this groaning land.—Ev'n now I seeThe savage bands, o'er reeking hills of dead,Forcing their rapid way.—I see them urgeWith rage unhallow'd to this sacred temple,Where good Osmingti, with his queen and children,Fatigu'd the Gods averse.—See where Arphisa,Rending the air with agonizing shrieks,Tears her dishevell'd hair: Then, with a lookFix'd on her babes, grief choaks its passage up,And all the feelings of a mother's breastThrobbing in one mix'd pang, breathless she faintsWithin her husband's arms.—Adown his cheek,In copious streams fast flow'd the manly sorrow;While clust'ring round his knees his little offspring,In tears all-eloquent, with arms outstretch'd,Sue for parental aid.—ZAPHIMRI.Go on—the taleWill fit me for a scene of horror.—ZAMTI.Oh! my prince,The charge, which your great father gave me, stillSounds in my ear.—E'er yet the foe burst in,"Zamti," said he—Ah! that imploring eye!—
That agonizing look!—"Preserve my little boy, my cradled infant—"Shield him from ruffians—Train his youth to virtue:—"Virtue will rouze him to a great revenge;"Or failing—Virtue will still make him happy.He could no more—the cruel spoiler seiz'd him,And dragg'd my king—my ever honour'd king,—The father of his people,—basely dragg'd himBy his white rev'rend locks, from yonder altar,Here,—on the blood-stain'd pavement; while the queen,And her dear fondlings, in one mangled heap,Died in each other's arms.—ZAPHIMRI.Revenge! Revenge!With more than lion's nerve I'll spring upon him,And at one blow relieve the groaning world.Let us this moment carry sword and fireTo yon devoted walls, and whelm him downIn ruin and dismay.—ZAMTI.Zaphimri no.—By rashness you may marr a noble cause.To you, my friends, I render up my charge—To you I give your king.—Farewell, my sov'reign.—ZAPHIMRI.Thou good, thou godlike man—a thousand feelingsOf warmest friendship—all the tendenciesOf heart-felt gratitude are struggling here,And fain would speak to thee, my more than father.—Farewel;—sure we shall meet again.—ZAMTI.We shall—ZAPHIMRI.Farewell—Zamti, farewell. (Embraces him) Orasming, now
The noblest duty calls us.—Now rememberWe are the men, whom from all human kindOur fate hath now selected, to come forthAsserters of the public weal;—to drench our swordsIn the oppressor's heart;—to do a deedWhich heav'n, intent on its own holy work,Shall pause with pleasure to behold—Exit, with conspirators.ZAMTI.May the Most HighPour down his blessings on him; and anon,In the dead waste of night, when awful justiceWalks with her crimson steel o'er slaughter'd heapsOf groaning Tartars, may he then directHis youthful footsteps thro' the paths of peril;Oh may he guide the horrors of the storm,An Angel of your wrath, to point your vengeanceOn ev'ry guilty head.—Then,—then 'twill be enough,When you have broken the oppressor's rod,Your reign will then be manifest—Mankind will seeThat truth and goodness still obtain your care— A dead march.What mean those deathful sounds?—Again!—They leadMy boy to slaughter—Oh! look down, ye heavens!Look down propitious!—Teach me to subdueThat nature which ye gave.—Exit.A dead march. Enter HAMET, OCTAR, guards, &c.OCTAR.Here let the victim fall, and with his bloodWash his forefather's tomb.—Here ends the hated race.—The eastern world thro' all her wide domain,
Shall then submissive feel the Scythian yoke,And yield to Timurkan.—HAMET. Standing by the tomb.Where is the tyrant?—I would have him see,With envy see, th' unconquer'd pow'r of virtue;How it can calmly bleed, smile on his racks,And with strong pinion soar above his pow'r,To regions of perennial day—OCTAR.The fatherOf the whole eastern world shall mark thee well,When at to-morrow's dawn thy breathless corseIs born thro' all our streets for public view.It now befits thee to prepare for death.HAMET.I am prepar'd.—I have no lust or rapine,No murders to repent of.—Undismay'dI can behold all-judging heav'n, whose handStill compassing its wond'rous ends, by meansInextricable to all mortal clue,Hath now inclos'd me in its awful maze.Since 'tis by your decree that thus besetTh' inexorable angel hovers o'er me,Be your great bidding done.—OCTAR.The fabre's edgeThirsts for his blood—then let its light'ning fallOn his aspiring head.—Guards seize Hamet.MANDANE, within.Off,—set me free.—Inhuman, barb'rous ruffians.—OCTAR.What means that woman with dishevell'd hair,And wild extravagance of woe?—MANDANE.My griefsScorn all restraint—I must—I will have way.—She enters, and throws herself on her knees.Me,—me, on me convert your rage—plunge deep,Deep in this bosom your abhorred steel,But spare his precious life.—OCTAR.Hence, quickly bearThis wild, this frantic woman.—MANDANE.Never, never—You shall not force me hence. Here will I clingFast to the earth, and rivet here my hands,In all the fury of the last despair.He is my child,—my dear, dear son.—OCTAR.How, woman!

My mother!—ZAPHIMRI.Fatal rashness!—Mirvan, say,Is Zamti too destroy'd?—MIRVAN.Smiling in pangs,We found the good, the venerable man:Releas'd from anguish, with what strength remain'd,He reach'd the couch, where loft Mandane lay;There threw his mangled limbs;—there, clinging to the body,Prints thousand kisses on her clay-cold lips,And pours his sad lamentings, in a strainMight call each pitying angel from the sky,To sympathize with human woe.—The great folding doors open in the back scene.ZAPHIMRI.And see,See on that mournful bier he clasps her still;Still hangs upon each faded feature; still

DE VOLTAIRE.SIR,A Letter to you from an English author will carry with it the appearance of corresponding with the enemy, not only as the two nations are at present involved in a difficult and important war, but also because in many of your late writings you seem determined to live in a state of hostility with the British nation. Whenever we come in your way, we are ferocious, we are islanders, we are the people whom your country has taught, we fall behind other nations in point of taste and elegance of composition; the same cause that has witheld from us a genius for painting and music, has also deprived us of the true spirit of Tragedy; and, in short, barbarism still prevails among us.But, notwithstanding this vein of prejudice, which has discoloured almost all your fugitivepieces, there still breathes throughout your writings such a general spirit of Humanity and zeal for the Honour of the Republic of Letters, that I am inclined to imagine the author of the English Orphan of China (an obscure islander) may still address you upon terms of amity and literary benevolence.As I have attempted a Tragedy upon a subject that has exercised your excellent talents, and thus have dared to try my strength in the Bow of ULYSSES, I hold myself in some fort accountable to M. DeVOLTAIRE for the departure I have made from his plan, and the substitution of a new fable of my own.My first propensity to this story was occasioned by the remarks of an admirable criticMr. Hurd, in his Commentary upon Horace. of our own. upon the

ORPHAN OF THE HOUSE OF CHAU, preserved to us by the industrious and sensible P. DU HALDE, which, as our learned commentator observes, amidst great wildness and irregularity, has still some traces of resemblance to the beautiful models of antiquity. In my reflections upon this piece, I imagined I saw a blemish in the manner of saving the Orphan, by the tame resignation of another infant in his place; especially when the subject afforded so fair an opportunity of touching the strugglings of a parent, on so trying an occasion. It therefore occurred to me, if a fable could be framed, in which the Father and the two Young Men might be interwoven with probability and perspicuity, and not embarrassed with all the perplexities of a riddle, as, you know, is the case of the HERACLIUS of CORNEILLE, that then many situations might arise, in which some of the nearest affections of the heart might be awakened: but even then I was too conscious that it must be executed by a genius very different from myself.In this state of mind, sir, I heard with pleasure that M. De VOLTAIRE had produced at Paris his L'ORPHELIN DE LA CHINE: I ardently longed for a perusal of the piece, expecting that such a writer would certainly seize all the striking incidents which might naturally grow out of so pregnant a story, and that he would leave no source of passion unopened. I was in some sort, but not wholly disappointed: I saw M. De VOLTAIRE rushing into the midst of things at once; opening his subject in an alarming manner; and, after the narrative relating to GENGISKAN is over, working up his first act like a poet indeed.Meum qui pectus inaniter angit Ut Magus.In the beginning of the second act, he again touches the passions with a master-hand; but, like a rower who

has put forth all his strength, and suddenly slackens his exertion, I saw, or imagined I saw, him give way all at once; the great tumult of the passions is over; the interest wears away; GENGISKAN talks politics; the tenderness of a mother, flying with all the strong impulses of nature to the relief of her child, is thrown into cold unimpassioned narrative; the role pour Pamoureux must have its place, and the rough conqueror of a whole people must instantly become Le Chevalier GENGISKAN, as errant a lover as ever sighed in the Thuilleries at Paris. Your own words, sir, strongly expressive of that manly and sensible taste, which distinguishes you throughout Europe, occurred to me upon this occasion: Quelle place pour la galanterie que le parricide & l'inceste, qui desolent une famille, & la contagion qui ravage un pais? Et quel exemple plus frapant du ridicule de notre theatre, & du pouvoir de l'habitude, que Corneille d'un côté, qui fait dire à Thésée.—Quelque ravage affreux qu'étale ici la Peste;L'absence aux vrais amans est encore plus funeste. Et moi, qui, soixante ans apres lui, viens faire parler une vielle Jocaste d'un viel amour: & tout cela pour complaire au goût le plus fade & le plus faux qui ait jamais corrompu la literature. Indeed, sir, GENGISKAN, in the very moment of overwhelming a whole nation, usurping a crown, and massacring the royal family, except one infant, whom he is in quest of, appeared to me exactly like the amorous OEDIPUS in the midst of a destructive plague. Nunc non erat his locus.—How would that noble performance, that Chef d'oeuvre of your country, the ATHALIE of RACINE, have been defaced by the gallantry of an intrigue, if a tyrant had been introduced to make love to the wise of the high-priest? or if JOAD, entertaining a secret affection for ATHALIE, and being asked what orders he

would give relating to the delivery of his country, should answer, "aucune," none at all.—And yet this is the language of a northern conqueror, whining for a mandarin's wife, who has no power of resisting, and having no relation to the royal family, could not, by an intermarriage, strengthen his interest in the crown But to you, sir, who have told us that Love should reign a very tyrant in Tragedy, or not appear there at all, being unfit for the second place; to you, who have said that NERO should not hide himself behind a tapestry to overhear the conversation of his mistress and his rival, what need I urge these remarks?—To fill up the long career of a tragedy with this episodic love must certainly have been the motive that led you into this error; an error I take the liberty to call it, because I have observed it to be the hackneyed and stale stratagem, of many modern writers. Within the compass of my reading, there is hardly a bad man in any play, but he is in love with some very good woman: the scenes that pass between them, I have always remarked, are found dull and unawakening by the audience, even though adorned with all the graces of such composition as yours, of which it is but justice to say, that it bestows embellishments upon every subject.For me, sir, who only draw in crayons, who have no resource to those lasting colours of imagination with which you set off every thing; a writer such as I am, sir, could not presume to support that duplicity of passion which runs through your piece. I could not pretend, by the powers of style, to suborn an audience in favour of those secondary passages, from which their attention naturally revolts. A plainer and more simple method lay before me. I was necessitated to keep the main object as much as possible before the eye; and therefore it was that I took a survey of my subject, in order to catch at every thing that seemed to me to result

with order and propriety from it. A scantiness of interesting business seemed to me a primary defect in the construction of the French ORPHAN OF CHINA, and that I imagined had its source in the early date of your play. By beginning almost "gemino ab ovo," by making the Orphan and the mandarine's son children in their cradles, it appeared to me that you had stripped yourself of two characters, which might be produced in an amiable light, so as to engage the affections of their auditors, not only for themselves, but consequently for those also to whom they should stand in any degree of relation. From this conduct I proposed a further advantage, that of taking off the very obvious resemblance to the ANDROMACHE, which now strikes every body in your plan. This last remark I do not urge against accidental and distant coincidencies of sentiment, diction, or fable. Many of the Greek plays, we know, had a family-likeness, such as an OEDIPUS, an ELECTRA, an IPHIGENIA in TAURIS, in AULIS, a MEROPE, &c. But what is a beauty in RACINE, seems in his great successor to be a blemish. In the former, nothing depends on the life of ASTYANAX but what was very natural, the happiness of the mother: in the latter, the fate of a kingdom is grafted upon the fortunes of an infant; and I ask your own feelings, (for no body knows the human heart better) Whether an audience is likely to take any considerable interest in the destiny of a babe, who, when your Zamti has saved him, cannot produce any change, any revolution in the affairs of China? No, sir; the conquered remain in the same abject state of vassalage, and the preservation of the infant king becomes therefore uninteresting and unimportant. He might die, sir, in cutting his teeth, of the hooping cough, or any of the disorders attendant on that tender age: whereas when the Orphan is grown up to maturity, when he is a moral agent in the piece, when a plan is laid for revenging

himself on the destroyers of his family, it then becomes a more pressing motive in the mandarine's mind; nay, it is almost his duty, in such a case, to sacrifice even his own offspring for the good of his country. In your story, sir, give me leave to say, I do not see what end can be answered by ZAMTI'S loyalty: his prospect is at least so distant, that it becomes almost chimerical. And therefore as history warrants an expulsion of the Tartars, as it was not upon the first inroad, but in process of time and experience, that they learned to incorporate themselves with the conquered, I had recourse to my own preconceived notions. Whether I was partially attached to them, or whether my reasonings upon your fable were just, you, sir, and the public, will determine.You will perceive, sir, in the English Orphan some occasional insertions of sentiment from your elegant performance. To use the expression of the late Mr. DRYDEN, when he talks of BEN JOHNSON'S imitation of the ancients, you will often track me in your snow. For this I shall make no apology, either to the public or you: none to the public, because they have applauded some strokes for which I am indebted to you; and none certainly to you, because you are well aware I have but followed the example of many admired writers; BOILEAU, CORNEILLE, and RACINE, with you; and in England, MILTON, Mr. ADDISON, and Mr. POPE. It was finely said by you, (I have read the story, and take it upon trust) when it was objected to the celebrated abbè METASTASIO; as a reproach, that he had frequent transfusions of thought from your writings, Ah! le cher volcur! il m'a bien embelli. This talent of embellishing I do not pretend to; to avail myself of my reading, and to improve my own productions, is all I can pretend to; and that I flatter myself I have done, not only from you, but many of the writers of antiquity. If the authorities I have abovementioned were not sufficient, I could add another very bright example, the

example of M. De VOLTAIRE, whom I have often tracked, to use the same expression again, in the snow of Shakespear. The snow of SHAKESPEAR is but a cold expression; but perhaps it will be more agreeable to you, than a word of greater energy, that should convey a full idea of the astonishing powers of that great man; for we islanders have remarked of late, that M. DeVoltaire has a particular satisfaction in descanting on the faults of the most wonderful genius that ever existed since HOMER; insomuch that a very ingenious gentleman of my acquaintance tells me, that whenever you treat the English bard as a drunken savage in your avant propos, he always deems it a sure prognostic that your play is the better for him.If the great scenes of SHAKESPEAR, sir; if his boundless view of all nature, the lawn, the wilderness, the blasted heath, mountains, and craggy rocks, with thunder and lightening on their brows; if these cannot strike the imagination of M. De VOLTAIRE, how can I expect that the studied regularity of my little shrubbery should afford him any kind of pleasure? To drop the metaphor, if the following tragedy does not appear to you a MONSTROUS FARCE, it is all I can reasonably expect. But whatever may be your opinion of it, I must beg that you will not make it the criterion by which you would decide concerning the taste of the English nation, or the present state of literature among us. What you have humbly said of yourself, in order to do honour to your nation, I can assert with truth of the author of the English ORPHAN, that he is one of the worst poets now in this country. It is true, indeed, that the play has been received with uncommon applause; that so elegant a writer as the author of CREUSA and THE ROMAN FATHER was my critic and my friend; and that a great deal of very particular honour has been done me by many persons of the

first distinction. But, give me leave to say, they all know the faults of the piece, as well as if it had been discussed by the academy of Belles Lettres.—We are a generous nation, sir; and the faintest approaches to merit, always meet here the warmest encouragement. One thing further I will assure you, in case you should discover any traces of barbarism in the style or fable, That if you had been present at the representation, you would have seen a theatrical splendor conducted with a bienscance unknown to the scene Francoise; the performance of the two Young Men would have made you regret that they were not in your piece; and, though a weak state of health deprived the play of so fine an actress as Mrs. CIBBER, you would have beheld in MANDANE a figure that would be an ornament to any stage in Europe, and you would have acknowleged that her Acting promises also to be the same: moreover, you would have seen a ZAMTI, whose exquisite powers are capable of adding Pathos and Harmony even to our great SHAKESPEAR, and have already been the chief support of some of your scenes upon the English stage.Upon the whole, sir, I beg you will not imagine that I have wrote this Tragedy in the fond hope of eclipsing so celebrated a writer as you are: I had an humbler motive, propter amorem quod to imitari aveo. Could I do that in any distant degree, it would very amply gratify the ambition of,Sir,your real admirer, and most humble servant, The AUTHOR of The ORPHANS of CHINA.London, April 30, 1759.
