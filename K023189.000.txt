the ArtTo live on little with a chearful heart, (A Doctrine sage, but truly none of mine)Lets talk, my friends, but talk  before we dine: Not when a gilt Buffet's reflected pride'Turns you from sound Philosophy aside;Not when from Plate to Plate your eyeballs roll,And the brain dances to the mantling bowl.Hear Bethel's Sermon, one not vers'd in schools, But strong in sense, and wise without the rules. Go work, hunt, exercise! (he thus began)Then scorn a homely dinner if you can. Your wine lock'd up, your Butler stroll'd abroad,Or kept from fish, (the River yet un-thaw'd)If then plain bread and milk will do the feat,The pleasure lies in you, not in the meat. Preach as I please, I doubt our curious menWill chuse a Pheasant still before a Hen;Yet Hens of Guinea full as good I hold,Except you eat the feathers green and gold. Of Carps and Mullets why prefer the great,(Tho' cut in pieces e'er my Lord can eat)Yet for small Turbots such esteem profess?Because God made these large, the other less. Oldfield, with more than Harpy throat endu'd,Cries, "send me, Gods! a whole HogA West-Indian Term of Gluttony, a Hog roasted whole, stuff'd with Spice, and basted with Madera Wine. barbecu'd!"Oh blast it,  South-winds! till a stench exhaleRank as the ripeness of a Rabbit's tail.By what Criterion do ye eat, d'ye think,If this is priz'd for sweetness, that for stink?When the tir'd Glutton labours thro' a Treat,He'll find no relish in the sweetest Meat,He calls for something bitter, something sour,And the rich feast concludes extremely poor: Cheap eggs, and herbs, and olives still we see,Thus much is left of old Simplicity! The Robin-red-breast till of late had rest,And children sacred held a Martin's nest,Till Becca-ficos sold so dev'lish dear,To one that was, or would have been a Peer. Let me extoll a Cat on Oysters fed,I'll have a Party at the Bedford Head,Or ev'n to crack live Crawfish recommend,I'd never doubt at Court to make a friend. 'Tis yet in vain, I own, to keep a potherAbout one vice, and fall into the other:Between Excess and Famine lies a mean,Plain, but not sordid, tho' not splendid, clean.Avidien or his Wife (no matter which,For him you'll call a  dog, and her a bitch)Sell their presented Partridges, and Fruits,And humbly live on rabbits and on roots: One half-pint bottle serves them both to dine,And is at once their vinegar and wine.But on some  lucky day (as when they foundA lost Bank-bill, or heard their Son was drown'd)
At such a feast,  old vinegar to spare,Is what two souls so gen'rous cannot bear,Oyl, tho' it stink, they drop by drop impart,But sowse the Cabbage with a bounteous heart. He knows to live, who keeps the middle state,And neither leans on this side, or on that:Nor  stops, for one bad Cork, his Butler's pay,Swears, like Albutius, a good Cook away;Nor lets, like  Naevius, ev'ry error pass,The musty wine, foul cloth, or greasy glass, Now hear what blessings Temperance can bring:(Thus said our Friend, and what he said I sing)First Health:  The stomach (cramm'd from ev'rydish,A Tomb of boil'd, and roast, and flesh, and fish,When Bile, and wind, and phlegm, and acid jar,And all the Man is one intestine war)Remembers oft  the School-boys simple fare,The temp'rate fleeps, and spirits light as air. How pale, each Worshipful and rev'rend GuestRise from a Clergy, or a City, feast!What life in all that ample Body, say,What heav'nly Particle inspires the clay?
The Soul subsides, and wickedly inclinesTo seem but mortal, ev'n in sound Divines. On morning wings how active springs the MindThat leaves the load of yesterday behind?How easy ev'ry labour it pursues?How coming to the Poet ev'ry Muse? Not but we may exceed, some Holy time,Or tir'd in search of Truth, or search of Rhyme;Ill Health some just indulgence may engage,And more, the Sickness of long Life, Old-age; For fainting Age what cordial drop remains,If our intemp'rate Youth the Vessel drains? Our Fathers prais'd rank Ven'son. You supposePerhaps, young men! our Fathers had no nose?Not so: a Buck was then a week's repast,And 'twas their point, I ween, to make it last:Better to keep it till their friends could come,Than eat the sweetest by themselves at home. Why had not I in those good times my birth,E're Coxcomb-pyes or Coxcombs were on earth?Unworthy He, the voice of Fame to hear,( That sweetest Musick to an honest ear;
For 'faith Lord Fanny! you are in the wrong,The World's good word is better than a Song)Who has not learn'd,  fresh Sturgeon and Ham pyeAre no rewards for Want, and Infamy!When Luxury has lick'd up all thy pelf,Curs'd by thy  Neighbours, thy Trustees, thy self,To friends, to fortune, to mankind a shame,Think how Posterity will treat thy name;And  buy a Rope, that future times may tellThou hast at least bestow'd one penny well. "Right, cries his Lordship, for a Rogue in need"To have a Taste, is Insolence indeed:"In me 'tis noble, suits my birth and state,"My wealth unwieldy, and my heap too great."Then, like the Sun, let  Bounty spread her ray, And shine that Superfluity away.Oh Impudence of wealth! with all thy store,How dar'st thou let one worthy man be poor?Shall half the  new-built Churches round thee fall?Make Keys, build Bridges, or repair White-hall:Or to thy Country let that heap be lent,As M ** o's was, but not at five per Cent. Who thinks that Fortune cannot change her mind,Prepares a dreadful Jest for all mankind!And  who stands safest, tell me? is it heThat spreads and swells in puff'd Prosperity,Or blest with little, whose preventing careIn Peace provides fit arms against a War? Thus Bethel spoke, who always speaks his thought,And always thinks the very thing he ought:His equal mind I copy what I can,And as I love, would imitate the Man.In South-sea days not happier, when surmis'dThe Lord of thousands, than ev'n now Excis'd;In Forests planted by a Father's hand,Than in five acres now of rented land.Content with little, I can piddle hereOn  Broccoli and mutton, round the year;But  ancient friends, (tho' poor, or out of play)That touch my Bell, I cannot turn away.'Tis true, no  Turbots dignify my boards,But gudgeons, flounders, what my Thames affords:To Hounslow-heath I point, and Bansted-down,Thence comes your mutton, and these chicks my own: From yon old wallnut-tree a show'r shall fall;And grapes, long-lingring on my only wall,And figs, from standard and Espalier join:The dev'l is in you if you cannot dine.Then  chearful healths (your Mistress shall have place.And, what's more rare, a Poet shall say Grace.Fortune not much of humbling me can boast;Tho' double-tax'd, how little have I lost?My Life's amusements have been just the same,Before, and after  Standing Armies came.My lands are sold, my Father's house is gone;I'll hire another's: is not that my own,And yours, my friends? thro' whose free-opening gateNone comes too early, none departs too late;(For I, who hold sage Homer's rule the best,Welcome the coming, speed the going guest.)"Pray heav'n it last! (cries Swift) as you go on;"I wish to God this house had been your own:"Pity! to build, without a son or wife:"Why, you'll enjoy it only all your life."—Well, if the Use be mine, can it concern one,Whether the Name belong to Pope or Vernon?
What's Property? dear Swift! you see it alterFrom you to me, from me to  Peter Walter,Or, in a mortgage, prove the Lawyer's share,Or, in a jointure, vanish from the Heir,Or in pure  Equity (the case not clear)The Chanc'ry takes your rents for twenty year:At best, it falls to some  ungracious son,That cries, my father's damn'd, and all's my own. Shades, that to Ba ** n could retreat afford,Are now the portion of a booby Lord;And Hemsley, once proudVillers Duke of Buckingham. Buckingham's delight,Slides to a Scriv'ner or a City Knight. Let lands and houses have what Lords they will,Let Us be fix'd, and our own Masters still
