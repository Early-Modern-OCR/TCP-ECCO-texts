Begin, my Comfort.AIR and DUETT.MOTH.New Blessings, new Life ye impart,So oft as this Tribute is giv'n;The Pray'r of the dutiful Heart,Like Incense, arises to Heav'n.FATH.For this thro' your mortal EstateIn Peace shall ye walk, Hand in Hand;And your Joys shall be many and great,And your Days shall be long in the Land.RECITATIVE.FATH.But say, my Children, where's the second PropOf my declining Age? Why joins not heYour Orisons, and claims his wonted Blessing?MOTH.Why joins he not indeed?E.SON.My honour'd Father,High on the Mountain's Summit, that o'er-hangsThe swelling Flood, and of the distant Plains(Teeming with Wealth) commands an ample View,I left him gazing on the wide Expanse,And Joy enlarg'd his Eye.MOTH.Ah! seest thou not,Lord of my Life and Love, e'er since thy Hand,(Profusely kind!) on his ill-judg'd Request,Allotted him a Portion of thy Wealth,A verse to these our Duties and Delights,Our wonted social Converse, wide he strays,Shunning thine Eye, thy Counsel—much I fear him.FATH.Vex not thy tranquil Mind with fancy'd Terrors.By young Ambition led, and warm Desires,Error awhile may warp his ductile Heart;But stubborn Vice, or black Ingratitude—My Son, sure, knows them not
AIR.To yonder Summit stretch thine Eye,That young, aspiring Elm espy,The Victim of each angry Sky,To ev'ry Blast a Prey!As weak, defenceless, and oppress'd,By stormy Passions sore distress'd,My pliant Boy may sink depress'dIn Life's uncertain Day.Like that too easily inclin'dTo change with ev'ry shifting Wind,Till rooting Time mature his Mind,And Reason's Shoots appear;Then all the Virtues bloom apace,Then, comely in his ripen'd Grace,He stands, the Glory of the Chace,Majestically fair!RECITATIVE.MOTH.Oh! may it so betide!—behold, he seeks thee—Not such, I ween, the Countenance he wore,Ere dowried with thy Bounty.The PRODIGAL approaches, with Companions.PROD.Father, hail!—Thy Hand hath giv'n me Wealth, I thank thee for it;But more remains to grant—thy free ConsentTo taste the Pleasures, distant Climes afford:This unbestow'd, the first is valueless,And thou may'st take it back.MOTH.Too true my Fears!Base and ungrateful, is it not enoughThou hast withdrawn from his indulgent Love,With jealous Hand, thy Share of worldly Wealth?Must thou invade the Quiet of his Mind,That dearest Treasure of his Age? Alas!Yon spacious Robe, behold, how slight a CoveringFor th' Hugeness of his Grief!AIR.With deep Indents his rev'rend FaceTime's Hand hath furrow'd o'er—Canst thou, perverse, and void of Grace,Endure to wound him more?His Sorrows, see! too big to speak,Swell the pent Heart, and bid it break.CHORUS.His Sorrows, see! &c.RECITATIVE.MOTH.Why alters not thine Eye? Shame, Shame beset thee,Thou Stranger-Lad!FATH.Fond Advocate, forbear!—I am myself again—My Son, behold me!I have not long to live—and canst thou leave me?Plead not these falling Tears? for thee, my Child,More than myself, such Sorrows flow.PROD.Why seeksMy Father to retard my rising Hopes?Can I, by staying here, recall thy Youth,Or add a Moment more when Fate demands thee?For Duty's Cares, and Watchings, thou hast hereMore Children, whom domestic Life allures,And cool Desires engage: Me ardent PassionsAnd wild Extravagance of Soul enflame.AIR.Within one narrow Bound confin'd,In one poor Path to move,Is Torture to the spacious Mind,That thro' a World would rove;Rapid as Air, my active Soul,Would dart, impatient of Controul,From Clime to Clime, from Pole to Pole;Each Sweet would taste, each Joy attain,Thro' all Creation's wide Domain.RECITATIVE.FATH.I grieve, my Son, to say, thy youthful FancyLeads thee far wide from Happiness; from Joys,That Reason would inspire and give—yet go—And may thy Hopes be gratified! tho' muchI fear thy Disappointment.SIST.Oh, my Brother,With inattentive Ear, and rocky Heart,Mock not this kind Advice;
AIR.In vain alas! from Shore to ShoreIn search of Bliss we roam,And strange Delights abroad explore,Our best reside at home;Within the just and-pious HeartOur truest Joys we find,Which calm and sweet Repose impart,And leave no Sting behind.MOTH.The poison'd CupOf Riot and Excess, Youth's surest Bane,Too early hath he tasted.—Hence! begone,Thou, and thy loose Companions! vex no moreThe decent Quiet of our sober Roof,Or thy fond Father's Heart.PROD.I wanted notThis Taunt to urge me; when I next beholdMy Mother's Face, perchance with less DispleasureShe may receive me.E. SON.Stay return, my Brother!Behold our failing Sire, who long hath flourish'd,Like the tall Cedar on aspiring LEBANON,With all his growing Saplings branching round!Oh! view him now!—by Time and Grief impair'd,'Reft of his Strength, he bends with every Breeze.MOTH.No longer waste your unavailing SuitOn that obdurate Wretch, who scouls ContemptOn these your kind Persuasions.
