When ua, ue, ui, and uo, follow q in the same syllable, the u has the power of w, which power cannot more easily be expres∣sed to foreigners than by comparing it to the sound of u in the French word quoi! or quoy! as in quar-rel, quack, ques-tion, quick, quite, quit, quote, &c.A TABLE of words, which are indepen∣dent of the foregoing Rules and Excep∣tions, with the common Pronunciation expressed in Italics.BUOY, boey; victuals, vittles; colo∣nel, curnel; George, Jorge; island, iland; lieutenant, leuftenant; quay, kee; two, too; yacht, yot; yeoman, yewman; yelk, or yolk, (of an egg,) yoke.A TABLE of Foreign Words which still retain their original Pronunciation, (or nearly so,) notwithstanding that they are in a Manner adopted, by frequent Use, into the English Language.ACcoutre, antique, archives, arriere, banditti, beau, bureau, caviare, cartouch, connoisseur, courier, croup, cuirass, environ, escrutoire, fascine, groupe, intrigue, lieu, machine, maga∣zine, marine, palanquin, pas, piquant, pique, piquet, police, poltron, ponton, prame, profile, rendezvous, roquelaure, rouge, scout, sophi, soup, tête-à-tête, tornado, toupee, tour, transmarine, ver∣micelli, violoncello, jonquil, adieu.A TABLE, or INDEX, of the Words, which (with their several Compounds and Derivatives) are Ex∣ceptions to the foregoing Rules, viz.A.Vowels.Sounded likeRule.Page.ABóveoŭ321A-bróadoaaw1130Ac-qui-ésceiā112Af-fróntoŭ217An-gelaā214A-nyaĕ212At-tór-neyoŭ217Aufauō422B.    Bassaā214Bear (noun and verb)eaai927Be-lówowō725Be-stówowō725Bí-eriē112Blitheiī216Bloodooŭ623Blowowō724Bolloō217Ból-steroō217Bomboŭ217Bór-ageoŭ723Bór-oughoŭ217Bór-oughouŭ217Bougeouŭ723Boúg-etouŭ723Bouseouoo724Bow (noun)owō724Bowl (or bason)owō724Breadeaĕ927Breakeaā927Bréak-fasteaĕ927Breastea27Breath (noun)ea27Breéch, -es, -ings,eeĭ928Broadoaaw1130Bróth-erou218Bruiseuiū1231Bu-syuĭ218C.    Cám-brickaā214Cam-bridgeaā214Can-óeoeoo929Car-oúseouoo724Caúli-flowerauŏ422Ceyloneyē826Child but not their deri∣vativesiĭ216Christ but not their deri∣vativesClean-ly not in cleaneaĕ927Cleanse not in cleaneaĕ927Cól-ouroŭ218Comboō217Comeoŭ321Come-lyou321Com-atsoŭ218Cóm-fortou218Com-pa-nyoŭ218Cóm-passoŭ218Comptoou217Con-duitoŭ218Con-eyoŭ218Con-sta-bleoŭ218Con-troloō217Cou'douŭ723Cóv-e-nantoŭ218Cóv-eroŭ218Cóv-etoŭ218Cóv-eyoŭ218Coughouŏ724Cóul-terouō724Cóun-tryouŭ723Cóu-pleouŭ723Coúr-ageouŭ723Course, (dis-course, &c.)ouō724Courtouō724Coú-sinouŭ723Cóz-en (verb)oŭ218Crowowō724Cruiseuiū1231Cú-cum-beruou113D.    Dán-geraā214Dareaă320Deadeaĕ927Deafeaĕ927Deatheaĕ927Dis-cóm-fitoŭ218Doooo113Doneoŭ321Doorooō623Doveoŭ321Doú-bleouŭ723Doúb-letDoughouō724Doz-enoŭ218Dreadeaĕ927Drolloō217E.    En-déa-voureaĕ927En-dict and Indictiī216Eng-landeĭ215E noúghouŭ723F.    Falseaau215Fá-theraaw112Feá-thereaĕ927Floodooŭ623Floorooō623Flowowō724Flown (from fly)owō724Folkoō217Footooŭ623Forceoō217Fortoō217For-eigneiĕ928928Fór-feiteiī928Fourouo724Friendieĕ929Fruituiū1231Fúr-loughouō724G.    Gaugeauā422Ghostoō217Giveiĭ320Gloveoŭ321Glowowō724Goal (g soft)oaā1130Goldooo218Goneoo320Goodoo623Gov-erno218Gougeouoo724Gourdouō724Greateaā927Groatoaaw1130Grossoō217Growowō724H.    Hál-ser (l mute)aaw215Han't (for have not)aaw215Haveaă320Haút-boy (t mute)auō422Headeaĕ927Héark-eneaă928Hearteaă928Heartheaă928Héav-eneaĕ927Hea-vyeaĕ927Héi-fereiĕ928Héin-ouseiā928Heir (h mute)eiā928Hey!

Mr. T. S.AN APPENDIX, &c.1. B is mute before t, or after m, in the same syllable, as debt, lamb, &c.2. C sounds soft, like s, when followed by e, i, or an apostrophe, (denoting the absence of e,) as cedar, city, danc'd, &c.C sounds like sh, when followed by ea, ia, ie, or io, making different syl∣lables, as ocean, ancient, precious, social, &c. except society.CC, when followed by e or i, sounds like x, as in accept, accident, &c.C is mute in indict, victuals, scene, scent, science, sciatica, scissors, scission, scy∣mitar,

scythe, and the proper names, Scyros, Scylla, and Scythia.In all other cases c sounds hard like k.3. Ch, when properly English, has the same sound with the Italian c before e or i. Example, child, chain, &c.It sounds also like sh in words de∣rived from the French, as chaise, Champaigne, &c. and like k in words of Greek extraction, as Christ, school, stomach, archangel, &c. pro∣nounced ark-angel. But if arch comes before a consonant, ch has then its proper English sound, as in arch-bishop.Ch in loch sounds like f.Ch is mute in drachm, schedule, and schism.4. D is mute before ge, as in judge, bridge, &c. also in soldier.5. F in of sounds like v.6. G sounds soft like j before e, i, or an apostrophe, and hard (like the Greek γ) in all other cases.Example. Angel, rage, rag'd, giant, ginger, &c.Exceptions to g's sounding soft.1. In the participles passive of words ending in g hard (and also where∣ever g is doubled) it continues hard, notwithstanding the vowels e or i, or an apostrophe, as in dragg'd, begging, digging, &c.2. In the termination ger, wherever it makes a distinct syllable, g sounds hard, as in an-ger, fin-ger, lon-ger, stron-ger, &c. in which kind of words it may be observed, that the g sounds double, so as to belong to both syllables.3. Derivatives in er, ed, or ing, from pri∣mitives in ng, retain the g hard, as sing-ing, sing-er, from sing; hang-ing, hang-er, from hang; wing-ed, or wing'd, from wing, &c. in which kind of words it may be observed, that g sounds single, and belongs to the first syllable only.4. In the following words g is hard notwithstanding it comes before e or i; viz. geese, gewgaw, geld, gelt, Gertrude, get, (with its compounds,) gibberish, gibbous, giddy, gift, gig, gig∣gle, gild, girl, give, for-give, gilt, gimb∣let, gimp, gird, girt, girdle, be-gin,

gizzard, Gideon, Gibbons, Gilbert, and Gilpin.G is mute before n in the same sylla∣ble, as guash, sign, sovereign, &c. also in phlegm, seraglio, and bagnio.7. Gh sounds like g hard in ghost, and like ff in cough, lough, laugh, laughter, rough, slough, tough, trough, and e∣nough. In other words it is mute.8. H is mute in hour, honour, honest, heir, herb, humour, hostler, thyme, John, Thomas, Thomasin, and Thames. Also in Greek words when preceded by R, as rheum, rhyme, rhetoric, myrrh, &c. and, lastly, at the end of words, as ah, hah, Isaiah, Sarah, &c.9. K is mute before n in the same syllable, as in knave, know, knight, &c.10. L is mute in balk, talk, walk, stalk, halm, calm, calf, calves, falcon, half, alves, holme, (an island,) and Holmes, (a surname,) psalm, qualm, salmon, could, should, and would.11. N is mute after m in the same sylla∣ble, as hymn, autumn, solemn, &c.12. P is mute before s, and between m and t, as psalm, tempt, &c.13. Ph is always sounded like f, except in Stephen, nephew, and phial, where it sounds like v.Ph is mute in phthisic, and is pro∣nounced tizzic.14. Q is always followed by u, and, when it begins a syllable, sounds like cw, by which (as Mr Johnson ob∣serves) our Saxon ancestors well expressed it. But, in termina∣tions from the Latin -quus, and also in words of French extrac∣tion, it sounds like k. Example. Oblique, antique, quoif, conquer, risque, traffique, &c. some of which words are now more commonly spelt with c or k, as coif, risk, traf∣fic, &c.15. S sounds like z.1. In the third persons singular of all verbs, and the plural number of all nouns, as in has, was, tries, bees, times, &c.2. In pronouns possessive, as his, hers, theirs, and also when prece∣ded by the comma denoting posses∣sion, as father's, mother's, Tom's,

Will's, &c. Also in the particle as.Exceptions to the two last Sections.S has its proper sound when preceded by c, k, ck, f, p, q, or t, which admit not the sound of z so easily after them, as in speaks, beats, rocks, Jack's, Dick's, Gilbert's, cock's spur, cat's paw, &c.3. S sounds like z preceded by a li∣quid in the same syllable, as dam∣sel, crimson, Thames, Jersey, Guern∣sey, &c. and also,4. S, between two vowels, most commonly sounds like z, as daisy, reprisal, pleasant, please, rosin, &c.Except house, mouse, louse, goose, geese, sausage, purchase, promise, case, ma∣son, bason, basis, phasis, and thesis. Except also substantives in use, de∣rived from Latin verbs, as use, a∣buse, disuse, refuse, excuse, &c. and adjectives derived from the parti∣ciples passive of some Latin verbs, as recluse, profuse, abstruse, &c.Lastly, Except also the words con∣tained in the next section but one, where s sounds like zh.II. S and ss sound like sh in sure, (with its compounds,) issue, tissue, fissure, pressure, Russian, &c. also in the terminations -assion, -ession, -ission, -ussion, as in passion, impression, mis∣sion, concussion, &c.III. S, when preceded by a vowel, and followed by ion or ian, sounds like zh, as invasion, Ephesian, vision, de∣lusion, &c. But if it be preceded by a consonant, it sounds like sh, as in conversion, Persian, &c.S sounds also like zh before -ier, as osier, hosier, glasier, brasier, &c. and in the words leisure, measure, pleasure, and treasure.S is mute in isle, Lisle, Carlisle, island, viscount, and demesne.16. T, before io or ia, (making part of the same syllable with i,) sounds like sh, as nation, cautious, Egyp∣tian, satiate, &c. But, if t be∣long to the former syllable, its re∣tains

its proper sound, as question, fustian, combustion, &c.T is mute in words ending with -stle, as castle, thistle, bristle, &c.Th has two sounds; the one soft, as in thy, the other hard, (like the Greek θ,) as in thigh.I. Th sounds soft,
1st, in thence, there, (with their com∣pounds,) then, that, the, thee, these, this, those, thus, thou, thy, thine, their, theirs, them, though, although, beneath, bequeath, betroth, mouths, tythe, seythe, wreath, booth, and in the verbs bathe, mouth, seeth, loathe, soothe, and breathe.2dly, Wherever it occurs between two vowels, as father, mother, &c. except words of Greek extraction, and also derivatives from words ending with th hard, as earthen from earth, &c.3dly, Th sounds soft when placed be∣tween r and a vowel, as burthen, murther, &c. though in such words d is often pronounced instead of th, as murder, burden. In other cases th sounds hard.Th is mute in asthma, with its deriva∣tives.18. W is mute before r in the same sylla∣ble, as write, wrath, &c. also in sword, swoon, and answer, with their compounds and derivatives.The other consonants have the same powers as in other languages.The Lord's Prayer, the Creed, and the Ten Commandments, &c. divided into syl∣lables, (according to the rule for spel∣ling recommended by the learned Bishop Lowth,) with references placed to those syllables which are exceptions to the several rules laid down in this book respecting the pronunciation of vowels and diphthongs.The LORD's PRAYER.OUR Fá-ther,1 which art in Héav-en,2 hál-low-ed3 by thy Name.
