ZINGIS. A TRAGEDY.[Price One Shilling and Six-pence.]ZINGIS. A TRAGEDY. AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE.BY ALEXANDER DOW.LONDON: PRINTED FOR T. BECKET AND P. A. DE HONDT, IN THE STRAND. M DCC LXIX.ADVERTISEMENT.TO those who are not conversant in the history of the Asiatic nations, it may not be improper to give in brief, the story upon which the Tragedy of Zingis is founded, as it is taken from the TARICH MOGULISTAN, or History of the Mogul Tartars, written in the Persian language.In the twelfth century, most of the Tartar Ordas, or tribes, though governed by their own chiefs, paid tribute to the king of the Orda of the Keraits, who held his court under the title of the GRAND CHAN, in the city of Caracorum, well known since by the name of Ordabalich. The famous Zingis Chan, who afterwards conquered all the countries from the sea of Canton in China to the Nile, was prince of the Niron tribe of Tartars; and from his early youth, served in the armies of Aunac, the Grand Chan; and at last rose to the command of all his forces. Zemouca, chief of the Siogarates, supplanted Zingis in Aunac's favor. Zingis was disgraced. He retired to his Orda, which was in some measure independent of the Grand Chan. Aunac pursued Zingis with a small force, and was defeated. In the ensuing year Aunac was, in a pitched battle, totally routed by Zingis; Zangon the prince royal was slain, and the only daughter of Aunac, Ovisa Lugîn, fell into the conqueror's hands. Zingis having determined to give Ovisa in marriage to his favorite son Octar, who afterwards succeeded him in the empire of all Asia, occasioned an insurrection under Timur, another of his sons, who was in love with the princess. Timur fell in his rebellion, Ovisa died of grief, and the unfortunate monarch, Aunac, was killed in his flight, from an action, in which he was defeated by a part of the army of Zingis.Zingis Chan, whether we regard him as a conqueror or legislator, was, perhaps, the greatest prince, that ever appeared in history. He not only secured the empire of all Asia to his posterity for some ages, but even to

this day, two-thirds of that immense continent remains in the possession of princes of his blood. So fortunate was he in his children and descendents, that many of them did not yield in abilities to him; and they would, perhaps, have equalled him in fame, had his sword left them more to conquer.—The Emperor of China, the Mogul of India, the great Chan of Tartary, and the princes of the Krim Tartars, derive their blood from Zingis; and it is remarkable that, at one period, there were five hundred crowned heads of his race in Asia.This Day is Published,In Two Volumes Quarto, with a new and accurate Map, and Frontispiece to each Volume.

ZINGIS.ACT 1.SCENE, The Moon setting behind a Hill, and the Dawn of Morning.Enter CUBLA.CUBLA.THE waining moon has set behind the hill,And the faint twilight of the morning seemsTo wander o'er the East.—The storms that longHave shook the desart, now are pass'd away,And Altay's stream retards the war no more;Here Zingis forms the Nirons of the west;And royal Aunac on the farther shoreMarshals the Naimans, and demands his throne.Enter NEVIAN.NEVIAN.The emperor of Tartary commandsThy presence, Cubla.—CUBLA.Zingis should have cloath'dHis haughty message in less odious terms.Does he presume to hope that I will joinHis rebel sword against his antient lord?Tho' near ally'd to Zingis—tho' I ownHis parts unequal'd—his desert in arms—Nevian, my soul approves not of the meansBy which he seiz'd the scepter of the East;And drove great Aunac from the Tartar throne.NEVIAN.'Tis less a vassal's duty to approveThan to obey his sovereign's high commands.CUBLA.A vassal! By that honor which descendsFrom a long line of ancestors to Cubla,My soul rejects the thought.—What tho' my tribeIn Aunac's wide dominions form'd a state,And my brave fathers listen'd to the voiceThat issu'd from the throne, and rose in armsWhen war was in the field;—shall I becomeThe property of treason—be transferr'dThe mean appendage of a crown usurp'd?NEVIAN.Beware of treason—Cubla, can thy tribe,Bold as thou art, and confident in war,Contend with him who rules the Eastern world?Zingis is king—and now that homage claimsWhich thou didst pay to the imperial throne.—CUBLA.Presumptuous man!—does he prescribe to Cubla,Or talk of homage!—he who broke all tiesThat bind the faith of subjects to their kings!Whence is his right deriv'd?NEVIAN.He has been wrong'd—CUBLA.Wrong'd didst thou say?—what wrongs can justifyHis usurpation.—Should the world permitPrivate ambition thus to seize on crowns,Each daring villain that dispises lifeWould be the king or tyrant of mankind.NEVIAN.Rashly thou dost condemn.—Does Cubla knowThe Cause and progress of this bloody war?CUBLA.From the chill bosom of the stormy north,From Corea's distant clime, where I have longEmploy'd my sword against my country's foes;Last night arriv'd amidst domestic broils,I know not aught but that my king's dethron'd.NEVIAN.The prince of Soigara—the bold Zemouca,Was the first mover of this civil war.He, jealous of the fame and deeds of Zingis,And that high confidence his rival heldWith Aunac—to the royal ear convey'dMalicious falshoods, and intended treason.At length the monarch list'ning to his voice,Divested Zingis of his high command.The chief retired, and darkly pass'd alongTo his own native tribe—the hardy Nirons—They thought him wrong'd—they started to their arms,Determin'd to defend him from his foes.—Zemouca came—his host was roll'd away.The king advanc'd; in Tangut's bloody field,The valiant Zingis triumph'd o'er his lord.Amidst his ruin'd armies in the fightThe son of Aunac, graceful Zangon, fell;Whilst o'er his mangl'd corse his father fled,And left his capital and throne to Zingis.CUBLA.Zemouca was to blame.—'Twas dangerousTo drive a hero to the last extreme.The very coward, when bereft of hope,Turns on the lifted sword that threatens death.But now let Zingis grant his sovereign peace,And give the nations back to Aunac's sway;Fame will applaud the deed. He hopes in vain
The aid of Cubla to support his crimes:But since my sister was his favourite spouse,And gave to him a son—the princely Timur;For Timur's sake I will not join his foes.NEVIAN.'Tis not enough. Inflexible—severe,Tenacious of his power, and, like a god,Decisive in his councils—he declaresHimself the foe of temporizing friends.Consult thy safety.—Know, the Naiman princeBetrays his sovereign, and sollicits peace.CUBLA.Betrays the king to Zingis!—Tell your lord,Should he imbrue his hand in Aunac's blood,Cubla must be his foe.—My safety restsUpon my sword.—This day I would conferWith Zingis—quickly I will join his camp.Haste, and convey this answer to your chief.NEVIAN.It grieves me to behold my former friendThus rushing headlong into certain ruin.Cubla, let me conjure thee—guard thy words,And talk not thus of Zingis.—He is stern.—I'll bear a milder answer to the king.[Exit. Nev.Enter ZENA.ZENA.Hail, prince of Eluth!CUBLA.Noble Zena, whence?ZENA.Straight from the tents of Zingis—CUBLA.Zingis knowsAlready Cubla's mind.—Has Zena's sword,With fortune, turn'd against his antient king?ZENA.Blame not thy friend, tho' the event of warHath made me vassal to successful Zingis;My soul is faithful to unhappy Aunac.I mean to serve him.CUBLA.Darken'd is his fate—ZENA.Tho' few his friends since fortune left his side,Tho' scarce his strength his armour can sustain,Still unsubdu'd in soul, to Altay's banksHe leads the poor remains of former fields,And strives to raise his hoary head aboveThe cloud of his misfortunes. On thy aidHe rests his latter hopes.CUBLA.The faithless NaimanBetrays his king.—ZENA.That Cubla may prevent—CUBLA.Explain thy words.—ZENA.Zemouca will protectHis aged king—Nay more, will raise him high,—
Again restore him to the Tartar throne.He plans a daring purpose in his soul.He near this place is striding thro' the night,Like the dark genius of devoted Zingis.'Tis thine to point his thunder to the mark,And rouse dishonour'd Timur.—CUBLA.Ha! dishonour'd—Were Timur's backward steps beheld in war?Did Timur fly?ZENA.Untarnish'd is his fame.CUBLA.Whence, then, is this unmeritted disgrace,That hangs so darkly on my sister's son?ZENA.When with his ruin'd armies Aunac fledFrom Tangut's bloody field, young Timur press'dUpon the rear and seiz'd the hapless king,As faint and wounded by a brook he lay,His grey head leaning on his daughter's breast,His only child, the beautiful Ovisa.The hero saw—he pitied, and he lov'd—Brought the fair captive to the Niron camp,But gave her father's freedom to her tears;She in return bestow'd on him her heart.For this, fierce Zingis from his presence droveHis generous son.—The exil'd Aunac heardOf his fair daughter's love—her choice approv'd,And, by an embassy, propos'd to yieldThe bright Ovisa to young Timur's arms;To name him heir of Tartary should ZingisConsent to end, with peace, this civil war.CUBLA.Yet still the tyrant keeps his sword unsheath'd.—ZENA.He does—nay more—to-morrow Octar comes,His favorite son, tho' by a second bed,To wed the weeping captive—to deriveFrom her a title to the Tartar throne.But e'er to-morrow should'st thou join thy swordTo bold Zemouca—Aunac still might reign,And name young Timur heir to all his realms.CUBLA.But what intends Zemouca?ZENA.With the kingTo cross the Altay when the night returns,With terrible assault to rush on ZingisAmidst his armies.—By a great exploitTo win the East, or lose his noble life.He sent me hither—bade me to entreatHis sister's husband—his own former friend—If yet the memory of what Aunac was—If pity for a failing line of kings,Who rul'd mankind with justice, touch thy breast—CUBLA.Go—bid the chief approach.—This great designBecomes the spirit of the bold Zemouca.[Exit Zen.Th' injustice done to Timur—the disgraceThrown on my line—the partial favor shownTo Octar, sit not easy on my mind.The voice of Aunac too—the dying voice
Of ruin'd Majesty is ecchoing here.—I will support him.Enter MILA.Partner of my life!What anxious cares send Mila from her tent,At this dull hour of darkness, when the worldSleeps in the skirts of the retiring night?MILA.Why didst thou leave me, Cubla? Is there aughtUnfriendly from the Niron?CUBLA.No,—retire.—MILA.To meditate alone, bespeaks a mindNot well at ease, let Mila share the griefThat labours in thy bosom.CUBLA.By our loves,I know no cause of grief. Determined mindsBrood not upon misfortunes; they forgetThe accidents of life. When this base worldShall throw disgrace upon them, forth they rush,Swift as the lightning's flash that wings the storm,And right themselves.MILA.Has Zena then inform'd—CUBLA.Yes, Mila, all; I know how Cubla standsWith that presumptuous man. He has disgrac'dMe, in my nephew Timur, yet expectsMy aid in battle.MILA.He commands it, Cubla,Nay threatens disobedience with those frowns,That lords assume to vassals, when they failIn duty to the throne. This hour, Ovisa,By private message, to my ears conveyedHis gloomy purpose.CUBLA.What can he intend?MILA.To treat thee as a foe, shouldst thou delayto pass beneath his standard with the morn.This tedious march from Corea's distant realms,He construes into treason; but the causeLies in his policy, thou art the lordOf Eluth's warlike tribe. A chief of pow'r,And dang'rous in the state. The king himself,The all-subduing Zingis, mark'd the pathWhich leads to empire, and he fears that CublaMay do with him, what he has done to Aunac.CUBLA.I am beset with perils,—yet this stateSuits well the active tenor of my soul,Which loves to dwell in storms. I have resolv'dTo stretch my hand to Aunac, and supportThat ruin of a king. (Noise within.) But hark! what noiseSwells in the camp of Zingis?—Go, my love—Regain the tent—I must explore the causeFrom whence this tumult rose.—By dawn of day
I'll meet thy brother to concert the planOf deeds more daring, than were e'er atchiev'd.[Exit.MILA.'Tis done,—but still my fears—Enter ZEMOUCA.ZEMOUCA.My sister's voice!—MILA.My lord Zemouca, welcome to my soul!O chief of the Soigara!—from what a worldOf troubles art thou come!—ZEMOUCA.Yes—I have stroveWith some disasters, Mila, since the NironLed his rebellious tribe to Tangut's field,And triumph'd o'er his lord. Had loyaltyBeen less my choice—Had ease been more my care,Than self-approving honor, and that prideWhich lov'd to stand alone, when TartaryFell in the stream of conquest to a chief,I once scarce own'd my equal, I might useThe day to visit Mila, and have thrownThis cloud, I borrow, from the night, away.MILA.How fares it with the king?ZEMOUCA.Not such his state,As when in Ordu-bâla's splendid hallsHe rul'd the nations—On the farther side
of Altay's foaming course, my tribe surroundsThe king of Tartars—narrow is the campOf him, who covered Asia with his hosts!But still this sun which moves behind a storm,May issue forth, and shew his evening beams,Before he sets in night.MILA.Should Naima's princePrevail in battle—ZEMOUCA.May heaven's lightning blastHis armies and himself. Perfidious man!He treats with Zingis.MILA.Tartary is lost—The house of Aunac trembles to its base,And in its ruins will involve Zemouca.Why dost thou stand, against a world in arms,With unavailing valor?ZEMOUCA.Hear me, Mila;Ere next the night shall from these fields retire,Aunac shall reign o'er Asia. I have form'dA plot with Zena, in the Niron camp.Cubia will join us with his warlike tribe.At the dead midnight hour, we mean to rushOn Zingis in his tent.MILA.To rush on Zingis!The deed is desperate.ZEMOUCA.We claim thine aidTo forward our design. To thee is knownThe love of Timur, and his late disgraceFor the escape of Aunac. Thro' their tribesThe Nirons murmur for their gallant princeWho led them often to the fields of fame.Go to Ovisa: let her arm the sonOf haughty Zingis in her father's cause.Thus shall she wrest from tyranny the world,And rule the nations with the man she loves.MILA.And does my brother then resign Ovisa?ZEMOUCA.No—Mila, no.—She beams upon me still,Thro' all this tempest which involves my soul.The Queen of Asia!—But I must be calm,The softer passions suit not with a stateSo desperate as mine. Zemouca firstMust stretch his hand to Zingis, the eventMay lead thy brother to his soul's desire.Why, Mila, why in tears?MILA.I'll bear, my lord,Thy message to Ovisa. But my mindForbodes, I never shall behold thee more.ZEMOUCA.That heaven alone can tell—my sister stay!—Perhaps thou'lt ne'er behold me,—and thy lordTreads too a dangerous path. Let not our foesIn thee extend their triumph to our dust,
Take this—[giving a dagger.It is thy thy brother's gift.—Our houseWas ne'er dishonour'd.MILA.Son of daring Tangor!Our house was ne'er dishonoured, nor shall MilaStain the unclouded glories of her line.I know the purpose of this present—Here[putting it in her bosom.This friend shall rest. I'll call it to my aidWhen thou canst not defend me from my foes.[Exit.CUBLA entering with CAREDI.CUBLA.Caredi, hasten. Call the chiefs to arms,Rouse my brave Eluths—I will join them straight.I like not this confusion, this uproar,That Zingis raises round him in his camp,He may perhaps intend—My lord Zemouca,[embraces him.How fares it with my brother and my friend;I fear our zeal for aged Aunac's causeShall not avail.ZEMOUCA.Has Cubla learn'd from whenceThis tumult rose?CUBLA.All night the high divanSat in the tent of Zingis, and gave earTo proffered terms, from Naima's perjur'd prince.'Tis said they were axcepted. But the voice
Of war resounds thro' all the Niron camp.The nations start, with ardor, to their arms;Some daring enterprize is formed by Zingis,Against deserted Aunac.ZEMOUCA.Fear not that—Tho' Zingis loves to move thro' bloody fields,He tries not force, where policy avails.If Naima promis'd, with her sovereign's blood,To end this contest, Zingis will delayTo cross the Altay.—When the night descends,I will remove the king,—at once preventThe Naiman's treachery, and rid the worldOf the usurper.CUBLA.But that eagle sitsToo watchful on his rock,—we must not trustMuch to the foes neglect, for Zingis owesTo fortune less his greatness, than to skillIn war's extensive art.—We are too fewTo reach him, thro' his armies; we must raiseSome other swords to penetrate those linesThe Niron draws around him.ZEMOUCA.Our successDepends not on our numbers. We commandA hardy race, the Tartars of the north,Whose souls partake the nature of the storms,That rush across their climate. They delightIn the abrupt decision of the sword,And love a deed of danger. Nor on themRest all our hopes: the fair Ovisa armsDishonour'd Timur in her father's cause.
His late disgrace, ambition, love, revenge,Shall urge him on; and should the chief preferA tame submission to the will of Zingis,To Aunac's daughter, and the Tartar throne,Our glory must be greater, and our fameArise proportion'd to the perils round us.CUBLA.Friend of the hapless Aunac!—In thy voiceSpeaks forth the hero, and thy noble fireFalls on my soul, and kindles it to flame.Ere next the light which now bursts from the East,Shall gleam on Altay's streams, the Tartar tribesShall own another lord. Myself will rouseThe lion Timur; if that spirit dwellsIn him, which animates th' Eluthian line,Dishonour sits not lightly on his mind.But where, Zemouca, shall my tribe receiveThe king to night?ZEMOUCA.Upon that narrow point,Thou seest a lonely oak.—The morning starLooks thro' its wav'ring branches,—there the rockStretching into the Altay, breaks the stream,And forms a peaceful eddy. In that placeShall Aunac land, when the wan moon descendsBehind the western hills.CUBLA.I will attendTo-day the court of Zingis, and disguiseFor once, a soul that scorns to hide its hate.I will exhibit every mark of zeal,
To blot suspicion from his jealous mind,And turn the keeness of his eye from Cubla.But leave this camp, the dawn already gleamsAlong the field. Go,—in that show'r retire,That darkly rushes o'er the Altay's course.[Exit.ZEMOUCA.Whilst this blunt warrior, void of all design,Can thus encounter perils unconcern'd,Shall I, whose eye is fix'd upon a crown,And on the brightest star that ever roseUpon the eastern world,—the fair Ovisa—Shall I shrink back?—Shall I encourage doubtTo shake my resolution?—Hence—away—All further fear of death; already heHath stalk'd around me in each hideous form.—But yet this stubborness of heart—this pride,Which bore me up against this prosperous man,Hath quite fatigued my soul.—I'll stray no moreThro' Asia,—every foe I raise to Zingis,He adds unto his vassals.—On this plotI rest my latter hopes, and should I fail,I'll wrap me in my courage and retireFrom this base world amidst the storms I raise.[Exit.END OF THE FIRST ACT.ACT II.SCENE, Ovisa's Tent,Enter OVISA, from her Tent.OVISA.IF e're the spirit of a warrior slain,Journey'd in storms across the troubled sky:Last night, my brother Zangon pass'd this place,And call'd Ovisa hence. The voice was deep,As when high Arol, shaking all his woods,Speaks to the passing thunder.—Thro' my soulA pleasing horror runs; perhaps not longOvisa tarries here. The silent tombIs not the house of sorrow.—Airy formOf him who is no more! Where dost thou dwell?Rejoicest thou on golden-skirted clouds?Or is thy murmur in the hollow wind?Where ere thou art, mine ear with awful joy,Shall listen to thy voice!—Descend with night,If thou must shun the day.—O stray not farFrom the remains of Aunac's failing line.Enter MILA.MILA.Hail bright Sultana! let a faithful friend,[kneeling.Thus pay the homage which she owes a raceWho rul'd so long nations.OVISA.Mila, rise;—Belov'd companion of my better days!
Why dost thou, at this melancholly hour,Intrude upon the sorrows of Ovisa?MILA.To chace the cloud that hangs upon thy soul,I come the messenger of Aunac's friends.They sent me to disclose—OVISA.I know it all.Octar is come!MILA.Far other news I bring.Are we alone?OVISIA.From mortal ears remov'd.MILA.The sate of royal Aunac now dependsUpon Ovisa.—Should she lend her aid,The king might reign.—OVISA,Then he already sitsUpon the Tartar throne. Why dost thou thinkSo poorly of Ovisa? Haste, explainThis mystery,—for doubts begin to blastThen sudden joy that lighten'd o'er my soul.MILA.A plot is forming in the Niron camp,By Omrahs of renown, whom Cubla joinsWith all his Eluths. By the midnight hour,The king, thy father, with Zemouca, comesTo head the bold conspiracy, and rushOn Zingis 'midst his armies.OVISA.'Tis a deedOf desp'rate daring.—Didst thou say to night?Assist them heaven! But what avails the aidOf desolate Ovisa!MILA.Much.—Thy handsAlready hold the balance of the East.Ten thousand swords, obedient to thy call,May be unsheath'd for Aunac. In this campThe Tartars murmur thro' their martial lines,For the disgrace of Timur. Arm the princeAgainst his father.OVISA.Ha! I'll hear no more—To recommend a crime my soul abhors,To make a parricide of him I love,Suits not the feelings of Ovisa's mind.By private stratagem, by open war,By any means, let cruel Zingis fall;But let him fall by foes—The fame of TimurMust not be tarnish'd;—nor shall I adviseA deed of such complexion. Mila, knowI may be wretched—but must not be base.MILA.Then let Ovisa triumph in a heartThat feels for Nirons. Did the cruel raceOnce melt at the misfortunes of her house,Or spare the line that rul'd the eastern world?By him thy brother fell—By him the throneOf Aunac was usurp'd.—Thy father driven,
A feeble exile thro' the Tartar tribes,Thyself a captive.—But Ovisa feels!—Heavens! Is it any crime to rid the worldOf him, who riots in the blood of nations,And makes a pastime of dethroning kings?His guilt Ovisa—OVISA.It is more than common;And heaven some signal vengeance has prepar'dFor him who widows Asia with his sword:But let us not, in punishing, give birth,To greater crimes than his.MILA.Unhappy maid,Thou know'st not half the horrors of thy state.To day dishonour'd Timur must retire,A lonely exile from the Niron camp.Tomorrow Octor comes with brutal lust,To force thee to his arms. To night thy father—OVISA.Mila, proceed—MILA.Must welter in his blood.The price is fix'd for Aunac's sacred head,A peace to Naima. Soon as night returns,Perfidious Tajan will surround the king.OVISA.No more—I know the rest—misfortunes crowdToo much upon me. What should I resolve,Hemm'd in on every side? I'll urge the prince,And yet he must abhor me.MILA.Timur comes,As if by heaven directed to our aid.This is the time.—Remember thy condition.[Exit.OVISA.He comes.—With undiminish'd pomp he movesBehind his cloud—As when the sun thro' mistRolls on his faded orb. He greater seems,Tho' lost to half his beams. And shall I plungeThis god in parricide?Enter TIMUR.TIMUR.I did resolve—But cannot speak the tumult of my soul.—Queen of the East!OVISA.That title ill becomesA state like mine.—This instant leave me, Timur,If thou regard'st thy peace.TIMUR.What means, Ovisa?Where dwells the peace of Timur, but with herWho reigns within his soul?OVISA.Have we not prince—The house of Aunac—have we not involv'dThee in misfortunes? Pinion'd down thy fameThat spread to heaven? Cover'd thee with shame?And thrown disgrace upon the first of men.We made thee no return,—for kings dethron'd.
No savuors can bestow. Ovisa gave,'Twas all she had to give—her heart to Timur.TIMUR.'Twas all that Timur wish'd, thou matchless maid—But whence is this distress—this sudden griefThat labors in thy bosom? Tell me all;My soul is up in arms against those illsThat press upon thee.OVISA.Timur would not chuseTo hate Ovisa.TIMUR.No.—OVISA.Then let him notEnquire into her griefs. She may proposeA dreadful task. O leave me to myself,My soul is young in mischief and demandsSome time to harden ere it can resolveOn what my state requires.TIMUR.Speak but the word,Thou bright divinity that rul'st my soul;And then I will—what will not Timur do?I will—I know not what—but something moreThan ever mortal did.OVISA.Take heed young prince!Be not too rash to promise—Timur's wordIs like a god's, irrevocably fix'd:—But were my suit once known, 'twere criminal
Not to refuse it.—Daring son of Zingis!—I know thy lion-heart delights in perils,When honor leads thee to her bloody fields,Yet what I would propose would throw a dampOn all thy courage. In Ovisa's causeThere's more than danger—Guilt.—Thou shrinkest back.I thought it would offend.—My soul approvesThe noble horror that invades his mind.I leave him to his virtue.[Going.TIMUR.Stay—by heavens!—Thou must not thus depart.—Ovisa—speak,Speak all thy wishes and they shall be done.—Propose the peril.—Guilt can never dwellIn such a cause as thine.OVISA.Then know, my state,Uncommon in its horrors, now demandsThe sword of Timur.—Zingis shuts the doorOf hope against thee.—Octar comes to-morrow—What shall I do?TIMUR.I will defend—OVISA.Alas!—Who shall ward off the hand of death from Aunac?To-night he falls.—The cruel Zingis givesA peace to Naima, for her sovereign's head.A midst the ruins of a falling lineOvisa stands alone.TIMUR.I know thy soul,And quickly will resolve.—OVISA.No—Timur—no.Recall the thought, and be thyself again.Ovisa loves thy virtues, not thy crimes,And should'st thou stain thine honor, who can tellWhat she would think of thee?[Exit.TIMUR.The light is goneAnd left me darken'd, on a stormy seaOf various passions toss'd.—What should I do?To hide me in the cloud of my disgrace,And leave Ovisa and the world to Octar;Death dwells upon the thought. But to ascendA throne, besmear'd with blood,—a father's blood,And reign a horrid parricide in Asia,Suits not a soul like mine.—Enter CUBLA.CUBLA.While others watch the motions of the foe,Marshal their tribes, or furbish up their steelFor battle. Timur, whiles his time awayBefore the shrine of beauty.—Blush, young man,These are not arts in which our race excell'd,Nor these the means by which they rose to fame.TIMUR.Is Cubla, like the world, whose censure fallsNot on the guilty, but unfortunate?
As if success could recommend each crime,We only call the prosperous villain great.—Let Cubla judge of Timur, by himself,By the high spirit, which descends to bothFrom Eluth's line of kings; and he may knowDisgrace, unmerited, can never dampThe vigour of my soul.CUBLA.Yet still thou bear'st,With tameness, which but ill becomes our race,This weight of infamy, by Zingis, thrownUpon thee, in his wrath.TIMUR.Could Timur breakThro' honor and his duty, he might raiseA flame, the billowy Caspian shou'd not quench.But tho' my soul, undaunted in the field,Swells at the growth of danger and demandsMore than my share of battle; there are thingsWhich make me shudder, Cubla, and betrayA woman's weakness. Dark conspiracies,Frauds cover'd o'er with art—those devious paths,That lead the villains of the world to power,Please not the open spirit of my mind.I hate pre-eminence that springs from guilt,And never, but thro' honor, would be great.CUBLA.Timur farewel.—A man that can submitTo such indignities, as thou hast borne,Deserves not my attention.—Hence—away—Involve thee in obscurity.—It suitsThe tame morality of Timur's mind.
Go—leave the throne to Octar—To his armsGive up Ovisa.TIMUR.Ha! that strikes me home.Say, what dost thou advise?CUBLA.To draw thy swordAgainst thy father—Zingis—that proud man—That tyrant of the East.—Thou startest, Timur,His crimes, indeed, may shock a soul like thine.—He, who without remorse, has trod on kings,Has broke all sacred ties that bind mankind—Has ruin'd nations to be reckon'd great,And is unjust, not only to his foes,But to his son.—TIMUR.My heart with horror shrinksFrom such a deed.—CUBLA.So feels the feeble mind,That trembles at the thought of arduous deeds,And would impose its fears upon the world,As the effects of virtue.—Go—weak boy,I did advise thee.—Nay—I dare do more.Go, tell thy father, Cubla is his foe:This very night, in concert with his friends,He means to prove it; but his friends are suchAs shudder not at danger.TIMUR.He who doubtsMy courage, should prepare to rest his handUpon his sword.—No mortal man but Cubla
Durst thus.—But I'm too warm.—Thou said'st to night—My soul is dark, and secret as the tomb.Unfold thy purpose.CUBLA.Yes—to night, I meant,But thy officious virtue interferes,To raise thee high in Asia.—To thy armsTo give Ovisa—Place thee next to him,Who ought to rule the East.—To make thee heirTo Aunac's vast dominions. Dost thou stillHarbour a doubt? What darkness travels o'erThy thoughtful features? Is the fair OvisaIndifferent to Timur?TIMUR.Cubla—Stay,I must consider.CUBLA.Time is on the wing.We must resolve.—But ruin'd are my hopes!There Nevian comes, and he must not perceiveThat we confer. Long practis'd in the artsOf policy, and guile,—from every wordAnd motion of the eye, he draws conclusions.I'll soon return.[Exit.Enter NEVIAN.NEVIAN.Hail! gallant son of Zingis!I come not sobbing like thy other friends,With sad condolance and a woeful face,To teaze thee with my pity.—No, I bringThy pardon, Timur.TIMUR.Pardon, didst thou say?NEVIAN.Yes, full forgiveness from the king thy father.I thought it would surprize.—TIMUR.It does indeed.—NEVIAN.I did it all—inexorable longOn my address, the lord of nations frown'd,But still I urg'd.—At length he heard my suit,And bade me call young Timur to his presence.A fair occasion offers to retrieveThe honour thou hast lost—thy injur'd fame.He now restores thee to thy former rank,And sends thee forth, with half his warlike tribes,To give the final blow to exil'd Aunac.The troops, already marshal'd in the camp,With shouts await thy orders.TIMUR.Let them shout—Timur shall wait his time.NEVIAN.What do I hear?Is this th' impetuous Timur? He whose soulRush'd on before him to the fields of fame?And does he hesitate?TIMUR.Begone, old man,Least in my rage—NEVIAN.What means the son of Zingis?
This is the very frenzy of the mind.I am the friend of Timur.TIMUR.Hence—away—I'll follow soon.NEVIAN.His late disgrace disturbsHis reason. When the angry lion roars,There is no safety near him. To the tribesI'll bear the welcome news of thy return.[Exit.TIMUR.Was ever mind so agitated, tornWith such contending passions, as assailAt once the soul of Timur? To rejectThe proffer'd service, puts immediate endTo all my hopes. The king can not escape—Should I decline, another foe will riseAgainst ill fated Aunac.—Here she comes!Distraction—let me fly.—She bade me shieldHer ruin'd father, from the hand of death;And I, in my humanity, assumeThe office of his murderer.Enter OVISA.OVISA.He starts!Is then the presence of the lost OvisaHateful to Timur? Prince, I do not comeTo make thee deviate from the splendid pathThy soul delights to follow.[going.TIMUR.By the light,
That, from thy beauties, beams upon thy soul.—Thou must not leave me.—But thou must—away—Denounce thy curses on me.—In thy wordsOf softness dwells unutterable pain.O turn from Timur these indulgent eyes,That shed soft pity, from their lucid orbs—For I do not deserve it.—False to thee—False to my word—A traitor to my love—Thy father's murderer.OVISA.What means the prince,He is not dead?TIMUR.But he must die Ovisa,And by these hands. The cruel Zingis grantsMy pardon, and commands me to the war:To lead the Nirons o'er the Altay's stream,To rush upon thy father in his camp,And end this contest, that inflames the world.[Shout.Hark!—The impatient troops proclaim their joyTo see their prince restor'd, and shout for battle.I come.—Ovisa—OVISA.Timur, leave me.—Go—And, on the ruins of our falling race,Rear to thyself a monument of fame.Think not I seize thy skirts to keep thee here.Think not I weep, these eyes are only dimThink not I breath a sigh.TIMUR.Should guilty soulsFeel all my pangs—A moment of their woeMight expiate the crimes of half a world.
But Nevian comes!—I must away—My love,Canst thou forgive me.—No—Ovisa—No—Let not thy tenderness of soul extendTo such a wretch as Timur.—Yet his fateIs most to blame.OVISA.Then hear me son of Zingis!As love cannot detain thee—On my knees,Once more, I beg an aged parents life.O spare him, Timur; touch not his grey hairs,Let him escape;—for Zingis will not longIn Aunac have a rival to his power.The king, my father, worn with grief and years,Already hastens to the silent tomb.TIMUR.By him that reigns above, he shall not die.[Exit.OVISA.He's gone, and left me lonely to my woes.—Hasten thy journey, sun—and gracious night,Receive me to the bosom of thy gloom.The rustling wind, that whistles thro' thy trees,The solemn, serious, melancholly notesOf thy own bird, are music to mine ear,And please the dreary horrors of my soul.Enter MILA.Mila, thy tears will flow in vain.—My griefAdmits not of thy comfort.MILA.Did my pow'rEqual my wishes, soon the light of joyWould brighten on thy forehead. But my voiceMust now be like the raven's to thine ear.The van of Octar's army, from the hill,Is seen to pour along in clouds of dust;Edg'd round with gleaming arms, a chosen troopOn lightning hoofs come flying to the camp.It must be he.—OVISA.Where shall I hide my head?Timur where art thou? Call him to protectThe lost Ovisa—Timur.—He is gone!But why should I complain? High heaven decreeAt once the fall of our devoted house;Ovisa will not stay—a feeble light,Behind the sitting glories of her line.[Exeunt.END OF THE SECOND ACT.ACT III.ZINGIS's Pavilion.ZINGIS and Attendants discovered on a Throne.A Flourish of Trumpets.ZINGIS.GO, Nevian, issue forth our high decreeTo all the princes, potentates and kings,O'er whom the scepter of our power extends,On the first morning of the ensuing yearTo meet in Ordu-balâ's regal halls.We mean to publish laws to rule mankind—To bind the nations in one general chainOf policy—to mark, with strict regard,The bounds of justice between man and man,We call this council—not that we requireAdvice, but proofs of their allegiance due,And prompt obedience to the will of Zingis.NEVIAN.The king shall be obey'd—his high commandsWill be receiv'd thro' Tartary with awe,And all its princes hasten to the throne.[Exit.ZINGIS.Suida, prepare thyself. We send thee henceTo distant regions, near the rising sun—To great Canbâla—seat of Altun Chan,Who stiles himself the monarch of Cathay.—Make full demands for all his ravages
In these our kingdoms, when they shrunk awayFrom every bold invader's sword—and groan'dBeneath that worst of tyranny—a raceOf timid ministers, and feeble kings.SUIDA.Proud of the trust, and zealous to obeyThe lord of nations, Suida stands prepar'd.[Exit.ZINGIS.And thou, Jelizou, hasten to the west,Where Mâhmud, the Charizmian, has confin'dThe Caspian, in the circle of his empire.Tell him, while, as a son, he shall revereOur pleasure, we will act a father's part.That now it is our sovereign will the doorsOf commerce should be open'd with our realms.Not less on means that civilize mankindWe rest our glory, than on fame in arms.But, in the pride of hosts, should Mâhmud scornOur proffer'd friendship—call him forth to war;That he may see his kingdoms weeping bloodBeneath the sword of ZingisJELIZOU.Too well the pow'r of him who rules the eastIs known by Mâhmud, to reject his friendship.[Exit.Enter an Officer.OFFICER.Letters from Rizia, empress of the south,To whom the sable Indian nations kneel,With presents her ambassadors attend,And long to greet the sovereign of the world.ZINGIS.They shall have audience.—Say, what tidings bringThe messengers of Octar?OFFICER.We descryHis standards high erected on the plain.This morning his astrologers presag'dSome dire misfortune threaten'd by the stars,Which stops his progress.—ZINGIS.Should the stars presage,And join their influence as they roll aboveTo aid the foes of Zingis—he would trustMore to the prowess of a single armThan he should fear from them.—But what of Timur?OFFICER.We saw his warrior's covering Altay's course,And Aunac's banners waving on the shore—Soon the loud roar of war—Enter Officer.OFFICER.The prince returnsVictorious from the field. He brings in chainsA captive train.—The aged monarch, Aunac,Stood in the front of battle, till his linesGrew thin by Timur's sword.—A chosen band,That fought around their king—when all was lost,Bore their unwilling sovereign from the field;The fierce Sidasco, pressing on the rear,Pursues his flight.ZINGIS.Did not the Naiman princeSupport the king, for whom he rose in arms?He bore a specious cause upon his sword,Yet shrunk from danger: so I knew him stillA dark, designing, and deceitful man,Expert in policy, but cold in war.These are not means to gain the terms he claims.He knows us not—a coward never findsA friend in Zingis.Enter TIMUR, with Prisoners.Thou are welcome, Timur,This strict obedience to our sovereign will,Confirms thee in our favour.—Such exploitsBecome the son of Zingis.—Who are these?We want no captives—thou art young in war.—Ye bold, rebellious men, who did insult[To the prisoners.Our pow'r with feeble hands—who durst contemnRepeated offers of our royal grace,Which, thro' our vast dominions, were proclaim'd,Must perish in your folly—bear them hence,And execute our judgment.—TIMUR.It must not be.—Let Timur intercedeFor these unhappy men—my word is pass'dTo save their lives—my honor was engag'dWhen they resign'd their unavailing swords.ZINGIS.Audacious boy—no more—didst thou presumeTo pardon traitors?—Know'st thou not that Zingis
Is sovereign here, and that he delegatesHis pow'r to none?—Say,—when didst thou perceiveBy art, by argument, by open force,Our resolutions alter'd?—hence, away,[To his guards.And lead them to their fate.TIMUR,drawing.Stand off, ye slaves!—By heavens they shall not perish.—Thus oppress'd,I must forget that passiveness of soul—My duty to a father—with my bloodI will protect them.ZINGIS.Ha!—thus to my face—Dost thou not fear?—Should Zingis sacrificeThis victim to his fury?—Or—begone—I will not slay thee—take thy captives hence,I give them to thy pride.—This insolenceShall not unpunish'd go. Our steps to fame,To the dominion of the eastern world,Must not be thus retarded by a son,Who, in his disobedience, throws disgraceUpon the power of Zingis.—From our presenceWe must remove examples that suggestRebellion to our subjects. To the northWe send thee hence to-morrow—to a climeTempestuous as the temper of thy soul.In Tuba's forests, and those spacious valesWhere dark Selânga roars into the main;Compel the haughty Tomats to obey:
The ocean only shall our empire bound.Enter SIDASCO.My bold Sidasco!—SIDASCO.Sovereign of the world!The war is ended—Aunac comes in chains.ZINGIS.Our faithful chief, to thee—Enter OVISA suddenly, and kneels.Who durst admitThe princess?—Let the captain of our guardsThis instant be arrested.—Rise, Ovisa—Why dost thou kneel?—What wouldst have from Zingis?OVISA.If e'er thy heart was soften'd by distress,If e'er thy soul rejoic'd in generous deeds,O spare my father; let him die in peace—[Zingis is retiring, she seizes his skirt.Thou must not leave me, Zingis. O pronounceThe words of mercy.—Aunac's strength has fail'd,His friends forsook him; he is left alone,A poor old man!—No cause for fear remains.The brave are never cruel—they delightTo stretch their hand to raise a fallen foe,To speak the words of comfort—There he comes!What, Timur, hast thou done? Is this thy faith,Thy plighted faith to me? Like all thy race,Art thou perfidious!—Timur, 'twas not wellThus to betray the poor, the lost Ovisa!—TIMUR.Hear me, Ovisa, e'er thou shalt condemn.OVISA.Hear thee, false man!—Enter AUNAC, in Chains.Look there—behold him there—These are thy works—the ruin thou hast made.O Zingis! Zingis! wilt thou slay the king,The king that lov'd thee—cherish'd thee?—alas!The tyrant is inexorable.—ThouAlone who pitiest the distress'd Ovisa,O king! O father!—to thy friendly tombReceive thy daughter.AUNAC.Welcome to my arms—Thou lovely beam, that gild'st my parting hour!My eyes are blest—my wishes at an end.These hairs have long been whiten'd o'er with years,And my disasters bend me to the dust.Why should I wish to live? to haunt this worldThe ghost of what I was?—But thou art young—Yet, can I leave thee lonely midst thy foes?Shall those who riot in thy father's bloodDerive from thee a title to his throne?—Yet, what should I advise?OVISA.I know thy soul,And have resolv'd—Yes—all the fated lineShall fall at once, and leave the East to Zingis.
My heart, indignant, spurns this world away;My rising spirit struggles to be free.ZINGIS.No more! Sidasco—lead thy captive hence—TIMUR.I would entreat—but stern in his resolves;[To Aunac.He melts not at distress—nor lends an earTo those whom fortune left.AUNAC.O generous youth,Plunge not in our misfortunes.—In thy breastThy father's rigour dwells not. Brave, yet mild.I had a son like thee, whose rising fameShone thro' the gloomy winter of my age.But he is fallen, and of our royal houseShe now remains alone.—Ovisa, come—Embrace thy father—tho' my breast is coldTo all the world—my spirit burns for thee.TIMUR,aside.It is too much—Tho' ruin must ensue,I will obey the impulse of my soul.[Exit.ZINGIS,to Sidasco.Why am I d'sobey'd!—AUNAC.Omrah, lead on—This presence is unworthy of a king—We leave him to the horrors of his soul.But we will not upbraid—Yet know, we scornThy utmost rage. For he who longs for death,
Like us, may smile at tyrants when they frown,Ovisa, one embrace—It is the last—OVISA.We must not part—together let us die.ZINGIS.Conduct her to her tent.OVISA.Dost thou refuseThis little boon—this privilege of death?Relentless tyrant—know, thou shalt not longDivide Ovisa from her fallen race.[Both carried off.ZINGIS.Something like pity shakes my firm resolves,And almost melts the iron heart of Zingis.The king is old; yet may ambitious menHold forth a cause so specious—whilst he lives,Some dark conspiracies may rise around us.But to imbrue our hands in Aunac's blood,Would tarnish half the glories of our reign.Enter TIMUR and an Attendant.What wouldst thou, Timur? Go;—thy looks bespeakThy purpose—go—while Zingis rules the world,He rules himself—is absolute in mind,And none shall alter his determin'd will.[Exit Zingis, &c.TIMUR.In vain he rages; Aunac has escap'd;My chosen troop have rescu'd him from death,
And bear him far from danger.—Haste—away;[To his attendant.Inform Ovisa—lest in her despair—Tell her what Timur for her love has done—[Exit attendant.But ruin follows.—What shou'd I resolve?My father's rage is deadly. Should I fly,And bear Ovisa to the Caspian shores?This sword is my inheritance—the worldIs wide enough for conquest: other thronesWill rise for her in Asia.—Enter ZEMOUCA.Who art thou,That thus intrud'st upon me?ZEMOUCA.Not unknownIn Asia is Zemouca—TIMUR.Hapless man!Why dost thou tarry?—hence,—away—should ZingisHear of his mortal foe—not half the EastCould save thee from his fury—Leave this camp;To thee it is the hungry lion's den.ZEMOUCIn my prosperity I harbour'd notA fear of death.—Why should he now beginTo shew more dreadful to me, thro' this cloudWhich has involv'd my state?—To thee I oweMy life in battle. Thou hast sav'd it here,Among thy captives, at the risque of thine,And I do mean to make thee some return.TIMUR.I want it not.—A generous action bringsIts own reward,—a feeling of the soulOf greater value, than aught thou canst give.Zemouca leave me,—there is danger hereTo thee—To Timur, should it once be known,That he preserv'd the greatest foe of Zingis.ZEMOUCA.Time hurries on, and thou consider'st not,That sorrow hastes apace. With morning comesThy brother Octar, Towards the stormy northThy troops file off already.—Wilt thou leaveOvisa and the empire?TIMUR.Dost thou meanTo urge me on to parricide?ZEMOUCA.I urgeThee, not to parricide but open war,A foe invades thee, seizes on a throne,By justice thine; nay, forces from thy arms,The first of women. Timur has the pow'rTo right himself, yet passive in his soulHe in the tyrant still beholds the father.TIMUR.Zemouca, thou presum'st on thy condition,And therefore art so bold. I know from whenceThis zeal arises, and behind thy words,Perceive the gloomy workings of thy soul.—I blame thee not, my father is thy foe,And Timur is the rival of thy love,
Both then should perish.—But thou know'st me not,I am not made by nature for thy purpose,I look thro' artful men, and hate deceit,As I abhor the crimes thou dost suggest.[Exit Timur.ZEMOUCA.Curse on the virtues of this haughty boy,They level my designs.—I hop'd to rouzeTo strife, the hateful family of Zingis,And from the bosom of the storm to rush,To seize Ovisa, and the Tartar throne.But still some means are left.Enter ZENA.ZENA.Ill-fated prince,Why dost thou loiter here,—for Zingis knowsOf thy escape from death. From post to postHe rushes in his rage. (Flourish.) Away,—he comes,—Retire Zemouca, I will meet thee soon,Beside the rock, that with its crooked pines,Sounds to the passing Altay.ZEMOUCA.Draw thy sword.Why should I fly,—Is Zingis more than man?But yet this headlong fury—this despair—Suits not the brave;—not he alone must die,This mighty fabrick he has raised, shall fall,And whelm his race in ruin.[Exit.Enter ZINGIS attended.ZINGIS.To defendOur mortal foe Zemouca from our rage,To favour Aunac's flight, and in this warTo lengthen the misfortunes of the East,Are crimes beyond our mercy. Haste Sidasco,[Exit Sidasco,Pursue the king.—Bold treason is awake,Let all our guards be doubled,—let our spiesBeset the tent of every prince and chief.Call Timur hither,—He must be secured.Ovisa's beauty is the secret sourceFrom whence these deeds of disobedience spring.The cause must be remov'd. Let her be sentWithout delay, to Octar. Zena, thouConduct her hence. To thy command we giveThe troops of Timur: lead them to the north.ZENA.The lord of Tartary shall be obeyed.Enter TIMUR.ZINGIS.Have we not, Timur, with a father's care,Rear'd thee to manhood? Have we not with pow'rAnd princely dignities invested thee?Have we impos'd restraint upon thy will?Or enviously witheld thy steps from fame?Yet thou hast these indulgences return'dWith disobedience, treachery, and treason.Twice hast thou suffer'd Aunac to escape,
Once sav'd our greatest foe,—retarding thusOur course to glory;—dost thou think such crimesCan be forgiven thee?TIMUR.Timur does not meanTo justify his conduct, or assignThe rigor of his father, as the causeOf disobedience to his high commands.But in my soul, some other passions dwell,Than those that tend to desolate the world;I feel for the distress'd.—How could I seeOvisa's father slain amidst her tears!The king, who gave his daughter to my love,With all his realms—ZINGIS.Dost thou presume to claimThe kingdoms conquer'd by the sword of Zingis?Rebellious boy—forbear.—TIMUR.Let Octar reign,I claim not aught but her,—the fair remainsOf the long line that rul'd the eastern world.ZINGIS.Thou shalt not shake thy father's firm resolves—Know that our mind hath been divested long,Of all those feeble feelings, that might stopOur progress to dominion.—On a plan,Extensive as the object we pursue,Is form'd our conduct,—which nor perils sway,Nor those soft passions, that are better nam'dThe frailties, than the virtues of a king.
Zena, to-night, conduct her hence,—thy routLies thro' the camp of Octar.TIMUR.Chief, beware,There's danger in the service. Touch her not,Should I complain,—a tempest might arise,Which would involve in ruin and in death,The host of Zingis.ZINGIS.Ha! he utters treason,—Seize him.—TIMUR.The man who dares approach me first,Shall perish in his insolence. This sword,Which Zingis gave, shall nver be resign'd,To other hands than his.[Giving his sword to Zingis.You now may comeAnd execute the orders of the king.ZINGIS,to his guards.Forbear,—the race of Ogus, first of men,Were ne'er disgrac'd with fetters, like their souls,Their bodies still were free. Take back thy sword,A soldier's spirit dwells upon his arms.Know, Timur, tho' thy crimes excite our rage,We'll sooner take away the life we gave,Than break the manly vigor of thy soul.But hope not our forgiveness. Leave this camp,The desart is before thee. Should the sunRise on thee here, with death, and what is worse,With infamy we punish thy delay.[Exit Zingis, &c.TIMUR,to an attendant.Tamuzin, hasten to th' Eluthian lines,Bid Cubla meet me at the water-fall,Soon as the sun shall hide his splendid orbBehind the hills.—'Tis done,—the storm is o'er,[Exit Tamuzin.But the high heaving deep unsettled round,Wears still a face of ruin. Should OvisaConsent to share my fate, I scarce could callMy father cruel. See, the princess comes!She comes! and glads my soul, as when by night,The weary traveller sees a friendly beamTo light him o'er the desart.Enter OVISA.OVISA.To thy armsReceive me, Timur,—Why did I offend,I knew not all thy nobleness of soul.Forgive the error of a mind oppress'dWith more than common ills;—to thee I oweMy father's life.TIMUR.Thy tears more powerful were,Than the commands of him who rules the East.OVISA.Dark in his wrath, thy father pass'd from hence.TIMUR.And all his rage is turn'd against his son.In me Ovisa sees a banish'd man,This night I quit this camp.OVISA.Unhappy prince,Involv'd in the misfortunes of our house,Thy splendid glories set. It must not be,—Timur shall not be ruin'd.—Go, informThe tyrant, that his rigor has prevailed:I will compleat the purpose of his soul,And give my hand to Octar.TIMUR.To my brother!Was it Ovisa spoke!OVISA.I will restoreThee to the love of Zingis,—to that sphere,In which thou ought'st to move, and then pursueThat course my state requires.TIMUR.Farewel—OVISA.My lord,Thou dost not mean to leave me!—TIMUR.The commandsOf Zingis were, that I should leave this camp,Thou know'st how stern he is.OVISA.O turn not thus,Thy wild determin'd look upon the ground.Timur—TIMUR.I must be gone,—the hour is nearFor my departure hence.—With small regretI plunge into the horrors which surroundThe fortune of an exile. Since Ovisa—
But I will not upbraid.—A prince disgraced,Ought not to hope the favor of mankindShould follow him thro' ruin.—[Going.OVISA.Son of Zingis!I'll not be left unheard—nay then—I'm urg'dThe sooner to my purpose.—I resolv'dTo place thee high,—to give thee back to fame,To all thy dignities, and then demandAn end to grief from this.—[Drawing a dagger.TIMUR,taking it from her.Ovisa—hold—Sultana of my soul,—thou must not thusWithdraw from Timur. Thy auspicious lightMust mildly shine upon me thro' this gloom.Forgive the jealous transports of a mindO'erwhelm'd with love. Have I condemn'd unheardThe first of women!—OVISA,leaning on Timur.O I'm sick at heart,My sorrows, Timur, crowd too much upon me.TIMUR.Still there is hope,—some valiant friends remain,Whose firm affections no misfortunes change,Devoted to my service.—They shall guardOvisa hence.—To-night we urge our flightAcross the desart, to the Caspian shores.And meet what fate decrees.—My soul delightsTo strive with fortune, in her gloomy hour,To triumph o'er her frowns,—and to my swordTo owe my greatness, rather than deriveFrom ancestry a title to the world.THE END OF THE THIRD ACT.ACT IV.SCENE, The Camp of Zingis.ZEMOUCAalone.THE sun, descending from the clouded west,Hides in the billowy Caspian half his orb.Night comes apace. High Tugra, in a stormInvolves his summits. Thro' the aged trees,That bend o'er Altay, from its rocky banks,Howls the unfrequent wind. The murm'ring voiceOf Asia's gathered nations, mounts the sky,And dignifies with awful pomp, a sceneThat pleases well a soul resolv'd like mine,To push its lofty passions to extremes.Enter ZENA.ZENA.My lord Zemouca, give thy soul to joy,Still there is hope.—The banish'd Timur bidsHis friends assemble near Ovisa's tent,'Tis thought that he will join.ZEMOUCA.Does Timur theConspire with us? I would he had remain'dFirm to the Niron cause.ZENA.Thy words surprize—ZEMOUCA.So will my deeds. This instant I'll discloseThis plot to Zingis.—ZENA.Ha! What madness cloudsThe reason of Zemouca? Dost thou meanTo ruin all thy friends,—to purchase peaceAnd infamous forgiveness, with the bloodOf those who would support thee—Draw thee forthFrom the misfortunes which obscure thy life?Go—ruin'd prince—A mind so broke as thine,Deserves no change of fortune.[Going.ZEMOUCA.Chief of Kergis,Thou must not go—ZENA.Unhand me,—or, by heavensI may prevent the meaness thou intend'st,And to preserve thy fame, commit a deedI should perhaps repent.—ZEMOUCA.My gallant friend!Let me explain myself.—Place not to fearThe sudden resolution of a mind,Frantic with its misfortunes.—What availsThe fall of Zingis, if his son should reign?Nay—have Ovisa.—The detested thoughtDistracts my soul.—No more—no more of Timur.ZENA.Yet thou didst once approve—ZEMOUCA.While there remain'dA king to fill the vacant throne of Zingis,I urg'd his son to arms: but the rewardOf his rebellion, should we now succeed,Is the dominion of the eastern world,For Aunac is no more.—ZENA.Our sovereign dead!ZEMOUCA.Murder'd by fierce Sidasco, who o'ertookHis flight across the desart. Aunac scorn'dTo yield to rebels. With his little troopHe long sustain'd the fight, till cover'd o'erWith mortal wounds—he bow'd his hoary head,And breath'd his sacred spirit on the winds.ZENA.Perdition seize the traitors.—But let rageGive place to great revenge. We must enlargeThis breach among the Nirons—Urge the princeWith hopes of empire—Blow into a flameEach passion in his bosom, that may tendTo rid the East of tyranny and Zingis.And then—ZEMOUCA.Proceed.—ZENA.When the loud storm shall rise,And tumult riots thro' the gloom of night.While the young parricide, besmear'd with blood,Bends o'er his father.—Hast thou not a sword?—ZEMOUCA.A trusty one—ZENA.Then plunge it in his breast,And thro' the dark confusion of the scene,Ascend the throne. The nations, struck with awe,Will settle in thy presence, and look up,As to a god, to him who dares to seizeThe crown, as due to his superior parts;Tho' not transmitted by a line of kings.ZEMOUCA.My zealous friend—In other times than theseThy words would much offend.—Distracted—fall'nFrom every hope, ambition, love, revenge,May drive me to a deed my soul abhors,And stain my name with murder.—Had I beenBy fortune plac'd on less unequal terms,I would e'en scorn to be unjust to Zingis.Enter CUBLA hastily.CUBLA.Zemouca—Zena—hence—away, with speedAlarm our friends.—The tyrant in his rage,Hastens from post to post, and is inform'dOf our conspiracy.—ZENA.Then all is lost!ZEMOUCA.Let not despair assail your gallant minds,One bold resource remains. Prepare your tribesTo join the fortune of Zemouca's sword.Between this rock and Altay's rushing flood,On a green narrow plot, conceal'd from view,The brave remains of Timur's wasteful sword;A few determin'd friends now stand in arms,And wait my orders for a daring deed.Go—quickly arm—you soon shall hear of me.—[Exit.(Enter an OFFICER in haste.)OFFICER.Ye Tartars princes—He who rules the world,Commands your presence.ZENA.We obey the king.[Exit Officer.CUBLA.By the long honors of my noble race,I will not go—beneath a traitor's nameTo fall by Zingis. I will arm my tribe,Avow my hatred—call the tyrant forth,And die or conquer in an open war.ZENA.Ha! Would'st thou plunge thyself, thy friends, thy hopes,In certain ruin?—Let us hence with speedAnd face the tyrant.—Zingis will avoidTo seize on bare suspicion chiefs of power.CUBLA.But his suspicion is immediate death;Decisively severe, he singles outThe object of his wrath, and like the flashThat bursts from heaven, blasts it e're the worldPerceive the storm is near.ZENA.Should he accuse,Thro' his astonish'd guards our swords shall hewA bloody passage to his life, and giveHis guilty spirit to the rushing winds.CUBLA.It shall be so.—[Exeunt.(Enter MILA from the other side the stage.)MILA.My lord—my husband—Cubla—Ha! do'st thou then forbid me to partake
The perils which surround thy noble life.But he is gone, and left me to my fears.How awful is this moment—On its wingsHangs the uncertain fate of all I prize.Enter OVISA.OVISA.Where is the son of Zingis?—Whither turn'dThe steps of Timur?—At an hour like this,Oppress'd by fortune, and o'erwhelm'd by woe,My soul demands his presence.MILA.Has the queenHeard of—OVISA.The murder of my father, Mila—Do I seem unconcern'd? Have not mine eyesSome tears upon them? Do not sighs extendAt times my bosom? Dwell no signs of woeUpon my features? Yes—my heart is hard,Else from my grief, thou ought'st to have perceiv'dThat I had lost a father whom I lov'd.[Weeps.MILA.Alas forbear—OVISA.Disfigur'd, from his throneThe king of Asia fell,—of a long race,Who sat aloft in Tartary, and rul'd,Like gods, with justice—Aunac was the last:—For what am I?—A solitary beam,Left by that sun behind—to shine a whileA faint memorial of our splendid line,And then to fade in night.MILA.Tho' loth to addTo sorrows great like thine—to wound a soulThat feels too much already, I must tellSome further cause of grief.OVISA.No—Mila—no,Thou can'st not add to sorrows great like mine,Forsake me—leave me—my disast'rous state,Drives me beyond the reach of further woes.Alas my father! Pale and cold he liesOn the bare ground, beneath the chilly blastThat howls across the desart!—Will no friendDirect me—lead me—bear me to the placeWhere murder'd Aunac bleeds in all his wounds,Some faint remains of life may wander stillAlong his cheek—may faulter on his tongue.O let me press him in my warm embrace,Let poor Ovisa close his dying eyes.MILA.Forbear Ovisa—tho' perhaps this hourDecrees the fall of all I hold most dear.Such is thy strain of sorrow, that my heartMelts at thy woes, forgetful of my own.—All may be well again.—OVISA.Yes—Mila, all—But 'tis beyond the grave. This world presentsBut scenes of woe, and horror to my soul.MILA.My brother comes,—how desp'rate is his state,I know his purpose—my divided loveWould rend my heart: I must not tarry here.[Exit.Eenter ZEMOUCA.ZEMOUCA.Thou fair sultana of the eastern world,Behold thy slave Zemouca—On his kneesHe pays that homage which a subject owesTo the remains of Aunac's royal line.OVISA.Arise thou friend of him who is no more.The wayward fortune of our royal house,Has fall'n too heavy on the faithful few,Who follow'd us thro' ruin. Hapless prince,The camp of Zingis is no place for thee,Retire, and save thy life.—The royal causeWith Aunac fell forever.ZEMOUCA.That dependsOn Aunac's daughter. If that spirit dwellsIn that white bosom, and I trust it does,Which mark'd the genius of thy noble line,Ovisa, in her beauty, may ascend,From the misfortunes which obscur'd her race,And rule the nations on her father's throne.OVISA.No more—Zemouca—Such delusive hopesShall not betray me from the paths of grief.Let me indulge my woes.—A captive here,What can Ovisa do!ZEMOUCA.Not far from henceMy faithful tribe, stands ready to conveyTheir beauteous sovereign.—Ere the morning dawns
We shall be far from Zingis. In the WestThe tyrant has a foe—Charizmian Mâhmud,Who, thund'ring round his Caspian, now preparesFor war against the Niron.—OVISA.Prince—no more!I will not hence.—To move around the world,To raise the scorn or pity of mankind;For majesty in ruins, ill becomesOvisa's sex and dignity of soul.ZEMOUCA.Timur detains thee—Yes—thy father's foes,His murderers, the base usurper's race,Alone have influence with the lost Ovisa.The faithful few—his friends in his distress,His only friends, amidst a rebel world,The sole supporters of his falling house,Must not expect his daughter's grateful handTo draw them forth from ruin.OVISA.Is it wellThus to upbraid me in an hour of woe?I thought thee gen'rous.—Can'st thou wound a heartThat feels too much already.—ZEMOUCA.Time is lost.—We must away—Thy inexperienc'd youth—My loyalty for Aunanc's race—the loveThat fires this bosom—shall excuse the deed—I must determine for thee—bear thee hence—[Seizing her hand.Our hope, our cause must not be lost.—This sword
Is thy protection.—Yield not to thy fears;Why dost thou tremble? Struggle not my love—Hence—hence—away—OVISA.Presumptuous man—forbearThis, to thy queen?—Is this thy boasted love?Thy faith to Aunac and his royal line?Dost thou not fear me?—hence—unhand me straight,Or this thy sword—[Seizing his sword.Enter TIMUR, who draws and rushes forward, Ovisa interposes.O spare him, daring Timur!Unhappy man, he was the friend of Aunac,In the misfortunes of our house he falls—Despair invades his soul. Tho' great his crime,Why should it cancel all? I must forgive,—I dare not be ungrateful. Son of Zingis!Wilt thou not hear me?TIMUR.Not with more regardA voice from heaven.—Begone,—had not this place[to Zemouca.Been sacred like the presence of a god;Were not Ovisa here,—thy insolenceWould meet with its desert. Go, force me notTo take that life I lately spared in war.ZEMOUCA.It shall be so,—a vengeance more compleatBecomes the spirit of Zemouca's mind.My desperate state demands decisive meansTo end these ills that compass me around.[Exit.TIMUR.Away—vain man,—thy secret schemes availAs little, as thy valor in the field.Come lovely mourner,—come into my arms,O sooth a while thy fluttering soul to peace;All is not lost. Tho' fate has been unkind,One still remains to shield thee from thy foes.Ovisa,—let us hence,—some faithful friendsWait on the Altay's bank.OVISA.No—Timur—no,—Determin'd to remain,—my soul is fix'dOn death or great revenge!—Shall he,—shall Zingis,—The murderer of my father,—of my race—Weild Aunac's scepter—while Ovisa lives?No—should mankind in meanness bow the neckTo tyranny,—a woman's bolder handShall free herself,—nay more,—shall free the world.—Thus—thus oppress'd,—the softness of my sexMust sink beneath the greatness of my soul.TIMUR.What horrid gulph is opening to my view?—What should I do?—Here, hurried on to guilt,By all my wrongs,—by all the pow'r of love,And there witheld by virtue.—OVISA.Turn awayThese dark, disorder'd looks that pierce my soul.Reject me,—leave me,—tear me from thy heart,I stain thy virtue, ruin all thy fame.—
I turn thy sword against thy father's life.Throw the persuasive mischief from thy arms.Alas! why am I so oppress'd by fate,That I must urge to crimes I must abhor!—Ha! we must part,—I am demanded hence,I know the dreadful course I must pursue,To calm this tempest that inflames my soul.[going.TIMUR.O leave me not,—I will determine straight,—The thought is dreadful,—must I raise these hands,These impious hands, against a father's life,The king of Asia—OVISA.Asia's king is dead,—And Asia's tyrant triumphs in his fall.—No son was left by Aunac to revengeHis wrongs,—his blood. The poor, distress'd OvisaIs faint,—is feeble,—has not aught but tearsTo sooth the spirits of her murder'd race.O quickly call me hence, ye friendly shadesOf those that are no more. Receive the last,And the most wretched of a hapless race.I come,—farewel—what darkness falls around!Support me Timur.TIMUR.Empress of my soul!I will support thee.—O'er her shaded browLife faintly strays.—Awake, my love, awake;O leave me not to horror and dispair.She comes,—she breaths,—my soul is fill'd with joy.Enter NADIR, in terror.What woud'st thou Nadir?NADIR.Prince thou art betray'd,A thousand warriors, by the king's commandsurround this place,—thy train already seiz'd,Are led in chains; fierce Zena has possess'dEach pass from hence.—At such a time of peril,Can Nadir serve thee with his sword,—his life?Command them freely.TIMUR.Leave me, generous youth,Why shouldst thou fall,—perhaps I may demandThy valor in a more auspicious hour,But now away.[Exit Nadir.Retire,—my love,—retire,[to Ovisa.Regain the tent. The tumult of the sceneSuits not the feelings of a soul like thine.I have some friends among the warlike lines,That threaten us around. I still may raiseTheir virtue in my favor, turn the scaleOf fate, and save the first of womankind.OVISA.Stay, Timur, stay—TIMUR.The moment's on the wingThat may preserve us both.—OVISA.I know thy purpose.Thou plan'st some desperate deed, and wil't retireFrom thy misfortunes in the way thou lov'st.
And wilt thou leave me in the midst of foes,Depriv'd, perhaps, of means to end my grief?It must not be,—a soul oppress'd like mine,Throws off a woman's weakness, and demandsMy share of danger—with the man I love.TIMUR.It shall be so, sultana of my soul,I will remain.Enter Zena, with guards.ZENA.Go soldiers,—seize the prince,It is the will of Zingis.TIMUR.Faithless man;Dost thou presume?—Dost thou not fear this sword?Provoke me not.—With blood so base as thine,It has not been dishonor'd.ZENA.Prince, forbear.—I will not answer unavailing rage:Now to resist, were folly.—Thousands girdThis place with an impenetrable line:Resign thy sword.—Suspicions darkly passAlong the soul of Zingis,—he commands,That, for this night, his son may be confin'dAmong the warlike Kergis.OVISA.Timur, yield—Alas, they are an army. Let me notBehold the hope of Asia in his blood.TIMUR.My spirit yields not,—but thy tears prevail.Nadir, advance; I saw thee in the fieldAct well a soldier's part: receive my sword,It is a present which I scorn to giveTo any but a soldier. Chief of Kergis,Thy honourable service is perform'd,Conduct me hence.—ZENA.The orders of the kingExtend to fair Ovisa;—thro' the night,I must convey her to the camp of Octar;So Zingis has commanded.TIMUR.He who daresTo touch this goddess, with unhallowed hands,Shall perish in her presence.—Ha! my sword,—'Tis gone,—the moment of revenge is past,Unhappy Timur cannot die with fame.And shall she thus be severed from my heart?Ovisa!OVISA.Timur,—fare has done its worst,And we must part,—Lead Omrah, lead me hence.—Detain me not, [to Timur.] alas, to strive is vain,—Farewel, my lord,—thou soon shalt hear of me.—Perhaps thy cruel father will relent,When he shall hear his rigor laid me low;Perhaps he then may listen to thy grief,And give what was Ovisa, to thy tears.O place me by my father,—let his hand,
Cold as it is, support his daughter's head,Thro' her long slumbers in the peaceful grave.[Exeunt Zena and guards, with Ovisa.TIMURalone.Where am I?—whither shall I turn my steps?I'm here in darkness,—the fair light is gone,That gilded o'er my melancholy state.—I must resolve, she shall not thus be tornFrom Timur's side.—I'll wake his armies round,Proclaim my wrongs,—demand their aid aloud,And save Ovisa, or my life resign.[Going.Enter CUBLA.CUBLA.'Twas nobly spoke, at length thou hast resolv'd.—This is the time to right thyself,—thy love;—To gain the scepter wrested from thy hand,—To save Ovisa.—TIMUR.Let us hence, with speed—She shall be rescued, or this arm shall fail.—CUBLA.Stop, son of Zingis,—know, the queen is safe.The mounted squadrons wait thy last resolves,Ere they convey her hence.—Brave Zena stillIs Timur's friend,—if Timur will be bold.He sends thy sword to testify his zeal.Thou wer't irresolute,—and he perform'dThy father's orders,—will obey him still,Shouldst thou thy tame morality pursue.—TIMUR.It shall be so,—all further thought away.Haste, arm the tribes,—let all the gallant chiefsWho draw the sword for Timur, straight conveneBefore Ovisa's tent.—The fire that longWithin this bosom pent, convuls'd my frameShall burst in thunder forth,—and shake the world.[Exeunt.END OF THE FOURTH ACT.ACT V.Enter TIMUR.TIMUR.TH' appointed time draws near.—The silent moon,Now, cold and wan, rolls down the hazy west,And hastes to hide her half-enlighten'd orb.At such a dreary, undistinguish'd hour,The guilty ought to perpetrate such crimesAs ill can bear the splendid eye of day.Yet I am urg'd with such uncommon force—By love, by wrongs, by all a father's crimes—To use the sword—that, partial to my state,Mankind will pity, where they can't approve.Enter CUBLA, ZENA, and Conspirators.Hail, gallant chiefs. Are all the tribes in arms?CONSPIRATORS.All under arms.CUBLA.We only wait to knowThe post assign'd to each.—Thy high commands,To point the line of action thro' the night.TIMUR.Our daring enterprize, my friends, demandsConduct as well as valor.—On that hillNo feeble foe securely dreams in night.To wrest the world from Zingis, is a deedAs full of peril as it is of fame.

And to their honour, all historians say,No Spartan lady, ever sinn'd that way.—Ye Fair, who have not yet thrown out your bait,To tangle captives in the marriage state;Take heed, I warn you, where your snares you set,O let not Infidels, come near your net.Let hand in hand with prudence go your wishes,Men are in general, the strangest fishes!Do not for misery your beauty barter,And, O take heed,—you do not catch a Tartar.
