JOHN CUNNINGHAM, TAYLOR, At the Mahogany Door, near the Chapel, King's Street Golden Square.[Name on the Door.]THE variety of Advertisements by several Master Taylors in London, who have candour and honesty enough to adhere strictly to the terms of their proposals, induces him to offer his most humble address to the Publick, in hopes of such encouragement as his ability and integrity shall claim.—Gentlemen who are pleased to favour him with their commissions may rely upon their being executed according to the following rates: l.s.d.A Suit of the best superfine cloth;4150Half trimmed ditto,550Full trimmed ditto,5180Superfine cloth coat;2150Waistcoat of ditto,170Pair of Breeches of ditto,0180Suit of the best Second Cloth,3150Sattin Waistcoat,1150Corded Silk ditto,1130Silk knit Breeches,1116Velveret ditto,150Manchester ditto, ribed and plain,0190Worsted ditto, four thread,0160Fine Bath Coating Surtout Coats,170Suits of India Nankeen for young gen∣tlemen,130Fine Jean Fustian ditto, Hussar Dresses for Children, in pro∣portion.150Ladies Riding Habits of the best India Nankeen,2126 l.s.d.Ladies Riding Habits of fine Dimitty, white or coloured,3100Ditto of Superfine Cloth, faced with Silk,550Suit of the best Livery Cloth complete,360Ditto, with waistcoat, coat, cuffs, and collar of coat laced,3120If either of the above suits have Shag Breeches, it will add to the price080Livery Drab Surtout Coats,220Chairmens Great Coats,220Thickset Coats and Waitscoats, lined,220Ditto plain Fustian, lined,1160Coachbox Coats, lined with Padua Serge, and three Capes, complete,300Russia Drab Frocks for Grooms,0146Striped Flannel Waistcoats, lined, for ditto,0126Inferior sort, the Coat and Waistcoat together,0156Laced or embroidered Clothes cheap in proportion, and executed with the greatest elegance, propriety and dispatch.In cases of emergency a Suit made for a gentleman on one day's notice.—Whole Sets of Liveries executed in two days after receiving the order.Although the above Prices are much inferior to Taylors Bills in general, he undertakes to fur∣nish every article of the best quality.Gentlemen finding their own Cloth, or servants liveries, will be equally acceptable; and when finished, (upon calculation), will be found not to exceed the above estimation.No scruple as to sizes, like some of his advertising Brethren, admitting of all that comprehend common sizes.—Silk Garters to Breeches understood.—Ladies Riding Habits and Childrens Clothes made with taste, and to fit to a Nicety, which is what few Taylors attempt, and fewer perform to satisfaction.A little consideration must be productive of the possibility of the above Plan's being executed with honour and justice, especially as every article is purchased with ready money; the underta∣ker's ambition extending no further than doing justice to his customers, and procuring a genteel livelihood for his family, in preference to riches.
