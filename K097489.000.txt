Time was, when those articles of indulgence, which now every mechanic aims at the possession of, were enjoyed only by the Lord or Baron of a district. Men were then happy to be the vassals or dependants of that Lord, and prided themselves in little but their submission and allegiance. This was the state of things during feudal government: but as, on the increase of trade, riches increased; men began to feel new wants, they became gradually less hardy and robust, grew effeminate as their property accumulated, and sighed for indulgences they never dreamed of before.—Methods of conveying these indulgencies
from one part of the kingdom to another were then studied; roads were made passable, and carriages invented.For many ages coaches were so great a luxury, that none but old families were seen in them; and if they attempted, once in a dozen years, to travel a few miles in one, perhaps, in the course of the journey, a whole village with their teams were called in aid, to drag the heavy vehicle out of the clay, and set it on its wheels again:— riding on horseback being the only means of visiting a neighbour, beyond the reach of a walk, and that only in the summer-time. And it is but a very few years since, that ladies went about, from place to place, upon a pillion. Made roads were then unknown, and so little desire had the people to stir, beyond the bounds of their parish, that even mending them was never thought of.On the establishment of posts, a general communication was opened between all parts of the kingdom, and people received intelligence of every little improvement that was made: a desire to inspect those improvements, gave men an excentric turn; they were eager to see what was doing at some
distance from home, and rambled wide for that purpose. The inconvenience, and indeed impossibility of travelling, but at certain seasons of the year, led the way to the making of roads; making of roads drew thousands abroad, and a wish to be thought opulent by those whom they visited, led them into luxury of dress. The homespun garb then gave way to more costly attire, and respectable plainness was soon transformed into laughable frippery.In a few years, refinements took place in manners, and well had it been, were they merely refinements; but the misfortune is, they soon spread into extravagancies, and from being commendable, became objects of censure. In the reign of Charles I. luxuries were every where seen, and though the Civil Wars for some time smothered them, they broke out afresh in the reign of Charles II. Wealth then poured in upon the nation; gentlemen vied with each in the appearance they made; many by these means were ruined, estates changed their possessors, a fluctuation of property began, and every succeeding year gave birth to fresh wants and new expences. Luxury however had not then gained its present
footing: it is true, the profligacy of the capital made some inroads upon the country, but the inhabitants of the country looked on it with dread and astonishment. Some of the nobility and principal gentry, at this time, spent part of their winter in London, but the rest of the year they lived amongst their tenants with their usual hospitality. The expences of this age were confined to the education of their children, to their houses, their buildings, their furniture, their attendants and their entertainments; and their tenants and neighbours were considerably the better for it: the more they circulated their property within their own estates, the richer their estates became, and the more powerful and respectable they grew. Effeminacy of manners was then seen only in cities; balls and assemblies were scarcely known, and equipages far from being general.Matters however rested not here. Things gazed at with astonishment quickly grew familiar: the infection of the first class soon spread among the second, and what they formerly censured, they presently approved. Gentlemen of small estates began annually to visit the capital; they gradually made their visits
longer and longer, till, at last, it became the fashion to reside only in the country, when the heat made it intolerable in town. Stagecoaches were established, the communication between London and the country became more and more open, a taste for elegancies spread itself through all ranks and degrees of men, and an equipage was considered as a necessary of life.What is the case now? Are things otherwise than they were? No; expences are yet increasing, and we are still refining upon luxuries. The several cities and large towns of this island catch the manners of the metropolis, and are vicious and extravagant, in proportion to the wealth and number of their inhabitants. Scarce a town now, of any magnitude, but has its Theatre Royal, its concerts, its balls, and its card-parties. The notions of splendour and amusement that prevail in the Capital are eagerly adopted; the various changes of the fashion exactly copied, and the whole manner of life studiously imitated. Flys and machines pass from city to city; great towns become the winter residence of those whom slenderness of fortune will not carry to London, and the country is every where deserted.If I might presume to dictate to the world, I would venture to say, that a man of landed property is never so respectable as when refident on his estate; when improving his lands and enriching his tenants; when his beneficence may be read in the looks of the poor; when his house is open, not with the stiffness of a public day, that tells the neighbourhood he would not be perplexed at another time, but with all the hospitality of an ancient Baron.Gentlemen of very extensive property may act as they please; the dissipation and expences of a capital can no other ways injure them than in the opinion of their neighbours; but as to men of small fortune, the less they see of London the better. Look round among the families we know, and we can easily trace the infection of the metropolis; the more they pay their visits there, and the longer they continue, the more visible are their follies, and not only their follies, but their failings and their vices. The honest frankness of the country gentleman is obliterated by the equivocal politeness of the courtier, and the open sincerity of the good neighbour lost in the artifice and deceit of the man of fashion.For many years a country squire has been an object of ridicule: but, why? No other reason can be given, but that want of polish that too often characterizes the fops of the age. If we divest ourselves of prejudice, he will not appear in so contemptible a light: it is true, he may want taste and politeness, but he may possess qualities infinitely superior. Honest unadorned freedom is preferable to studied and fashionable deceit. The country squire lives upon his estate, spends his patrimony among his tenants and his neighbours, (which form, as it were, but one family around him) and a spirit of hospitality opens his doors to every comer; while the fine gentleman visits his domain, perhaps, but once in the summer, stays there as little as he can help, disdains any familiarity with his neighbours, neglects his grounds, and leaves his tenants at the mercy of his steward, In short, an effeminate life emasculates the fine gentleman, and renders him unfit for any thing but sipping of tea, and dealing the cards; whilst the robust and manly exercises of the squire keep him healthy and hardy, and, inured to hunger, danger and fatigue, enable him, when
called upon in the public cause, to be of real service to his country.But it is to be lamented, that the true country gentleman is seldom to be found. The luxuries and effeminacies of the age have softened down the hardy roughness of former times; and the country, like the capital, is one scene of dissipation. If there be any economy in their expences, it is merely the saving of necessaries, to waste on superfluities: the private gentleman with three or four hundred pounds a year must have his horses, his dogs, his pictures, his carriages, his parties of pleasure, equally with him of five times his fortune: dress, show and entertainment engross his attention; his lands are unimproved; debts accumulate upon him; he mortgages his estate; and, when he has lived to the end of his fortune, he either puts a dreadful period to his existence, or wears out the remainder of his life, a beggar.However alarming this picture may be, it is nevertheless a just one. As I take it, the happiness of life consists in health, ease, and competency, which is as much within the reach of a gentleman of three hundred pounds a-year, as one of three thousand. If the articles
of living are dearer than they were some few years back, (and they certainly are, a hundred per cent.) it ought to quicken the industry of every one, to increase his income, if possible, or reduce his expence in proportion to his fortune.It is not in the power of men, who have the income only of a small estate to support them, to encrease their revenues; but they may decrease their expences, or lay out their money to advantage. Frugality and economy have put many upon a footing with men of larger fortunes; and often made them far more respectable.—Nothing gives superiority in life, but independency. Whilst we are at the command of another, we are in a state of subordination: it is being master of one's self only, that makes a man free; and it is independency that makes him great.Now, be our fortune as great as it will, we are never independent, whilst we are in debt; and can a man be said to be free, while it is in the power of his taylor or his shoemaker to confine him? A mistaken notion, that a reduction in our way of living is disgraceful, has led many a man to his ruin. Retrenching our expences, when we have lived too fast,
is a proof of good sense; it declares an abhorrence of our follies, and a determination to be in future free. It is highly degrading to make a figure at the expence of others. Villains of every denomination have done it; an honest man therefore will despise the thought; and, if his connections have insensibly led him on, from one expence to another, till he finds himself involved, he will pursue the earliest and the readiest means to discharge his debts and set himself at liberty.Such is the absurdity in life, that men are rated in worth, according to the appearance they make. "Keep up appearances,"—said a dissipated poet,
Keep up appearances: there lies the test!The world will give thee credit for the rest.This idle notion has brought on the destruction of thousands. In this luxurious age, wealth is the only object of admiration; and to wear the appearance of wealth, we become expensive and extravagant in our manner of living. Thus we go on, 'till we exhaust the little property we possess; and, when we can keep ourselves no longer afloat, on what is called Credit, we sink into beggary and contempt.He who lives within his income, may be truly called a rich man. It is this that gives the Hollanders the reputation of being wealthy. They never live to the extent of their fortunes; and, of course, are able to do a deal of good. A family estate with them is seldom put up to sale; whereas with us, inheritances are ever at market. A Dutchman contributes as largely and as chearfully to the exigencies of the state, or to the erection of a public building, as he would to the repairs of his house, or the decoration of his garden.To be respectable, it is not necessary to live in a certain line of life.—Every man may be considered as the centre of a circle; some of a larger, some of a smaller; and, in this light, he is of greater or of less importance, according to the character he bears.—He who has fewest wants, and is most able to live within himself, is not only the happiest, but the richest man; and if he does not abound in what the world calls Wealth, he does in independency.—Though he may not be a Peer of his own country, he is a Lord of the creation; may fill his station equal to the first of men; and look down with pity and contempt
on the tinselled sycophant, though covered with an ermined robe, and parading with a ducal coronet.I will allow, it is rather mortifying to see a neighbour of less pretensions than ourselves, living in a degree of splendour which we cannot reach. If his fortune be large enough, to admit of it, it is well; if not, he is an object of contempt. But, be it as it may, whilst we have sufficient to command the necessaries and indulgencies of life, (wanting the superfluities) and do absolutely enjoy them, we are in a situation equal to any man; and if we keep but a pair of horses, and pay for that pair, we are far more respectable, in the eyes of sensible people, than he who is drawn in a coach and six, but his gate everlastingly crowded with importunate creditors.Persons with circumscribed fortunes, or whose family encreases upon them, would do well to retrench their expences in time; or retire from towns, and lay out their money with economy. It is wonderful to think what an appearance in life a person may make for a little money, who resides wholly in the country, and makes the most of what he possesses.
I speak not to persons in trade, as the scheme may be impracticable with them, but to gentlemen of small fortune, who, in a rural retreat, with a few acres of land, may live as well on three or four hundred pounds a-year, as many do, on three times the sum. The occupier of a middling farm enjoys all the necessaries and conveniencies of life, and many of its superfluities. Where shall we meet with better health, than where temperance and exercise enliven our minds, invigorate our bodies, and give a constant flow of spirits? A country life is commonly a chearful one; we there meet few of those rubs that embitter the hours of other men, and are the too constant attendants on ambition and vanity. It is there only that true happiness and independency can be found; where honesty and the best of manners mark the man; and where employment exempts from the ill effects of luxuryThe following then is an estimate whereby, a gentleman, with a wife, four children, and five servants, living in the country, may, with frugality, save 2500l. in the course of twenty years, keep two of his children at a boardingschool,
drink wine every day at his table, keep a carriage and four horses, and make an appearance equal to 1000l. a year, for half the money; and may, with the further addition of a small farm, live equally well for considerably less.THE FAMILY ESTIMATE. Annually. £.s.d.Rent of a house, with about 35 acres of land

The crops on the lands should be changed every year, but this will not alter the real product.In cultivating these 35 acres of land, the horses will be employed only about 52 days in the year, which, on an average, is only one day in the week: of course your farming servant will often be at liberty to thresh your corn, and do many other things: this will save much of the money I have charged for labour.I have allowed a fourth horse in this estimate, as, should the gentleman be fond of riding, he may keep one for that purpose. The other three I would recommend should match in colour and size, and should have nag tails; as, should one fall lame, another is ready to supply its place; besides they may occasionally be used as saddle-horses; or were the whole four to match, with a very little extra-expence in the harness, and an additional jacket to lay by, they might all be put to the carriage at times.No. 3 The Meat-Estimate.Twelve porkers should be killed yearly, that is, about one a-month, and 4 hogs for bacon, thus,
Twelve porkers, at 7 stone each, or 56 lb. give of meat672 lb.Four hogs
One sow is sufficient to supply the family with sixteen hogs yearly. for bacon, at 25 stone each, or 100 lb. gives800 lb. 14721472 lb. of meat is about 28lb. weekly, equal to four days provision for 9 persons,
Lest living on swine's fresh four days in a week should be thought improper, it may be observed, that your butcher will occasionally take a side of pork and give other meat in exchange, thus you need eat pork only two days in the week and the other two, bacon or ham with poultry. andFowls, ducks, turkeys, pigeons and geese, will give the fifth day's provision for the same number.The expence of the above is included in the farm. All that is necessary then to be paid for meat, is the provision of a days: thus
 £.s.d.9lb. beef or mutton, at 5d.0395lb. fish
Salt fish, bought of a wholesale dealer, will not cost more than 3d. per lb. which will allow more to be paid for fresh fish: besides, if near a river, some kinds of fish may be caught occasionally. at 6d.026Per week,063Or per year,£. 1650No. 4. The Horse-Estimate.Horses may be turned out to grass from about may 20, to October 20, they then should be taken into the stable and straw-fed, with corn, till about February 20; after this they should be fed with hay and corn till May 20 again.Now it will require of grass to feed 4 horses through the summer, with the addition of lattermath and turning into stubble,4 Acres.When fed with hay, each horse will eat about 5 trusses per week;
Brought on but I allow 6 trusses to afford for hay cut into chaff; this amounts to about two loads for each horse; 8 for the four.4 Acres.If a pair of these horses are used often in the carriage, they should never be kept upon straw; of course, while the other two are fed on straw, these will eat about 5½ loads more of hay; this, with the 8 loads reckoned above, will be the produce of9 Acres 13I allow each horse half a peck of oats a-day, from Oct. 20 to May 20; that is, 3 quarters, 2 bushels, 1 peck, which, for the four, is about 13 quarters; but it may be necessary to give the carriage horses the same quantity all the summer, which in the whole consumes 17 quarters and a half. The other two horses need no corn in the summer, unless; very hard worked.N.B. To save grass and oats, green clover might be given to horses in the stable, till near
the middle of October; for while they feed on this, corn is not necessary. £.s.d.Horses should have as much chaff as they will cat. Besides the chaff of the corn, give each a bushel of cut chaff daily (hay and straw mixed) which will cost a half-penny per bushel cutting, and that for the time he is in the stable will be 210 bushels, &c.089Shoeing, once in six weeks, at 1s. and 10d. per set; the price paid by farmers,0148Physic, per even money
Your servant should be able to bleed, and as to physic, the Gentleman's Pocket-Farrier, price 1s. sold by J. BELL in the Strand, London, will direct how to cure an ailing horse, at even a less expence than this; every remedy in that book, has been proved experimentally efficacious. Note, It is so small as to lie in a pocket book, and teaches you how to treat a horse, if ill upon the road.067Decline in value of 4 horses annually600 7100No. 5. The Cow-Estimate, Acres.Supposing a cow to be dry three months in the year, during which time she may be fed upon straw, there will require only 9 months good feed. Now, one acre and a half of grass will feed her well from the time you lay your pastures up for hay; suppose from the middle of April to the middle of October (six months) with the occasionally turning them on the common and into the stubbles. The spring grass of those pastures, before laid up for hay, will keep her from the middle of February to the middle of April (one month) so that there are but two months to feed her on hay, and she will, in three months, allowing a little for waste, eat about two loads, that is at the rate of 40lb. per day. Thus the three cows will eat six loads, the produce of4 Acres.And also the grass in summer of4½ 8½A cow, with this keeping, will yield milk and cream for the family, and on an average, about 132lb. of butter and 215lb. of cheese, but in order to this they must be young cows.Three cows then will yield annually 396lb. or about 7lb. and a half per week, enough for the family.Also 645lb. of cheese annually, that is about 12 lb. per week, enough for the family.The skimmed milk will go a great way towards keeping the pigs; and three calves annually will serve to meet other little expences not thought of. Care must be taken to have two of these cows always in milk. £.s.d.The decline in value of these cows will be annually, about2100IF a gentlemen, by way of amusement, or lessening his expences, will add about fifty acres of land more to his thirty-five, he may, with the same number of servants, excepting a little assistance at harvest, reap the following advantages, with this difference only, that it will require a little more of his own attention,
and leave his men and horses less at leisure to wait upon him. He must then send the produce of his farm to market, and, instead of keeping a horse merely for the saddle, he must admit him to draw occasionally: But even here, he may have his horses for his pleasure, on an average, two or three days in the week.These fifty acres I will suppose to be arable, and as land will produce more one year than another, I will give a course of crops for seven years, and shew the annual profits on an average. The course then shall be, supposing the ground to be tolerably good,

It is all to be converted into fodder and dung.If the farming servant can be spared at times, he may thresh much of the grain himself; this will be a saving: and there are still many advantages to be reaped, if a man will enter into the spirit of farming, from a neighbouring common, in breeding sheep, bringing up heifers, &c. and keeping geese.In short, a tolerable good farm will, upon an average, produce, with good management, 30s. or 40s. per acre, free of all expences.The price that corn bears, will often make an alteration in the profits of a farm, but I have set it a medium price.If you wish to keep dogs, I will suppose
the game you kill, to pay the expence of them.To such as wish to keep a few sheep, the following estimate will be acceptable.Fine large ewes with lamb, may be bought in at Michaelmas, at about 22s. each, which in the July following will sell again for
 £.s.d. 110The lamb will then sell for170The wool of the two, shorn before sold, will sell for about046 2126Deduct the first cost120Leaves profit1106OBSERVATIONS.It will take about an acre of grass to fatten five sheep; but, where grass is not plentiful, they may be fed on stubble till Christmas, then on turneps till May-day; next on rye, and then on clover till sold. No meadows will do for sheep in the winter, that are wet enough to let them sink up to the first joint of their legs; it will rot them.Note. An acre of turneps will feed 100 for the space of ten days, or about eight sheep from Christmas-day to May-day.N. B. Dung of sheep, when folded upon land, for the richness of the manure, is equal in value to the profits arising from the sale of them.The principle Implements necessary for a small Farm, are
A waggon, and a harness for ditto.A broad-wheeled cart, and a harness for ditto,A plough.A pair of large harrows.Ditto smaller.A roller.A winnow.A seed kit.Shovels, rakes, measures, sacks, sieves, &c. and the whole may be bought new for about 60l.If a gentleman does not understand farming, he may soon acquire the knowledge from a clever servant.The following estimate will serve to shew into what expences some persons run, for want of produce and economy, expending that on a carriage, which would maintain a family comfortably and elegantly.The Expence of keeping a Post-coach and Four, in a Gentleman's own Stable, if he is obliged to buy his Provender. £.s.d.Rent of a stable in town, for four horses1000Coachman's wages1600Board wages

These expences may be reduced, but not to make a genteel appearance. No allowance is here made for the occasional death of a horse, nor for waste of hay and corn.N. B. There are turnpikes, and sundry charges, when out, that ought to be considered also as part of the expence of keeping a carriage.FINIS.
