BARBAROSSA. A TRAGEDY. As it is Perform'd at the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane.LONDON: Printed for J. and R. TONSON and S. DRAPER in the Strand. MDCCLV. [Price 1 s. 6 d.PROLOGUE,Written by Mr. GARRICK, and spoken by him in the Character of a Country Boy.Measter! Measter!IS not my Measter here among you, pray?Nay, speak—my Measter wrote this fine new Play—The Actor-Folks are making such a Clatter!They want the Pro-log—I know nought o'th' Matter!He must be there among you—look about—A Weezen, pale-fac'd Man, do—find him out—Pray, Measter, come—or all will fall to SheameCall Mister—hold—I must not tell his Name.Law! what a Croud is here! what Noise and Pother!Fine Lads and Lasses! one o' top o't'other.[Pointing to the Rows of Pit and Gallery.]I cou'd for ever here with Wonder geaze!I ne'er saw Church so full in all my Days!—Your Servunt, Surs!—what do you laugh for? Eh!You donna take me sure for one o'th' Play?You shou'd not flout an honest Country-Lad,—You think me fool, and I think you half mad:You're all as strange as I, and stranger too,And, if you laugh at me, I'll laugh at you.[Laughing.I donna like your London Tricks, not I,And since you've rais'd my Blood, I'll tell you why?And if you wull, since now I am before ye,For want of Pro-log, I'll relate my Story.I came from Country here to try my Fate,And get a Place among the Rich and Great;But troth I'm sick o' th' Journey I ha' ta'en,I like it not—wou'd I were whoame again.First, in the City I took up my Station,And got a Place with one of th' Corporation,A round big Man—he eat a plagy deal,Zooks! he'd have beat five Poomen at a Meal!But long with him I cou'd not make abode,For, cou'd you think't?—He eat a great Sea-Toad!It came from Indies—'twas as big as me,He call'd it Belly-patch, and Capapce:Law! how I star'd!—I thought,—who knows, but I,For want of Monsters, may be made a Pye;Rather than tarry here for Bribe or Gain,I'll back to whoame, and Country-Farc again.I left Toad-eater; then I sarv'd a Lord,And there they promis'd!—but ne'er kept their Word.While 'mong the Great, this Geaming Work the Trade is,They mind no more poor Servants, than their Ladies.A Lady next, who lik'd a smart young Lad,Hir'd me forthwith—but, troth, I thought her mad.She turn'd the World top down, as I may say,She chang'd the Day to Neet, the Neet to Day!I was so sheam'd with all her freakish Ways,She wore her Gear so short, so low her Stays—Fine Folks shew all for Nothing now-a-Days!Now I'm the Poet's Man—I find with Wits,There's Nothing sartain—Nay, we eat by Fits.Our Meals, indeed, are slender,—what of that?There are but three on's—Measter, I, and Cat.Did you but see us all, as I'm a Sinner,You'd searcely say, which of the three is thinner.My Wages all depend on this Night's Piece,But shou'd you find that all our Swans are Geese!E'feck I'll trust no more to Measter's Brain,But pack up all, and whistle whoame again.EPILOGUE,Written by Mr. GARRICK.Spoken by Mr. WOODWARD in the Character of a fine Gentleman.Enter.—speaking without.PSHAW!—damn your Epilogue—and hold your Tongue—Shall we of Rank be told what's right and wrong?Had you ten Epilogues you shou'd not speak 'em,Tho' he had writ 'em all in Linguum Grecum.I'll do't by all the Gods!—(you must excuse me)Tho' Author, Actors, Audience, all abuse me!To the Audience.Behold a Gentleman!—and that's enough!—Laugh if you please—I'll take a Pinch of Snuff!I come to tell you—(let it not surprise you)That I'm a Wit—and worthy to advise you.—How could you suffer that same Country Booby,That Pro-logue speaking Savage,—that great Looby,To talk his Nonsense?—give me Leave to say'Twas low—damn'd low!—but save the Fellow's Play—Let the poor Devil eat,—allow him that,And give a Meal to Measter, Mon, and Cat,But why attack the Fashions?—Senseless Rogue!—We have no Joys but what result from Vogue:The Mode shou'd all Controll—nay, ev'ry Passion,Sense, Appetite, and all, give way to Fashion;I hate as much as he, a Turtle-Feast,But 'till the present Turtle-Rage has ceas'd,I'd ride a hundred Miles to make myself a Beast.I have no Ears,—yet Op'ras I adore!—Always prepar'd to die—to sleep—no more!The Ladies too were carp'd at, and their Dress,He wants 'em all ruff'd up like good Queen Bess!They are, forsooth, too much expos'd, and free—Were more expos'd, no ill Effects I see,For more, or less, 'tis all the same to me.Poor Gaming too, was mauld among the rest,That precious Cordial to a high-life Breast!When Thoughts arise I always game, or drink,An English Gentleman shou'd never think—The Reason's plain, which ev'ry Soul might hit on—What trims a Frenchman, oversets a Briton;In us Reflection breeds a sober Sadness,Which always ends in Politicks or Madness:I therefore now propose—by your Command,That Tragedies no more shall cloud this Land;Send o'er your Shakespears to the Sons of France,Let them grow grave—Let us begin to dance!Banish your gloomy Scenes to foreign Climes,Reserve alone to bless these golden Times,A Farce or two—and Woodward's Pantomimes!The Author of the Prologue and Epilogue, would not have publish'd them had it not been customary to print them with the Play. He is very sensible that they can have little or no Merit in the Reading, their Effect wholly depending upon the Characters which speak them, and the Novelty of introducing them. They were likewise written at a very short Warning, for the Author of the Play, had not provided these usual, and therefore necessary, Parts of the Performance, which Mr. GARRICK thought proper to provide at all Events.DRAMATIS PERSONAE.BARBAROSSA,Mr. Mossop.ACHMET,Mr. Garrick.OTHMAN,Mr. Havard.SADI,Mr. Davies.ALADIN,Mr. Usher.OFFICER,Mr. Mozeen.SLAVE,Mr. Walker.ZAPHIRA,Mrs. Cibber.IRENE,Miss Macklin.SLAVE,Miss Minors.OFFICERS, ATTENDANTS, and SLAVES.SCENE, the Royal Palace of ALGIERS. TIME, a few Hours about Midnight.ADVERTISEMENT."TRAGEDY, as it was anciently composed, hath been ever held the gravest, moralest, and most profitable of all other Poems. Hence Philosophers, and other gravest Writers, as, Cicero, Plutarch, and others, frequently cite out of Tragic Poets, both to adorn and illustrate their Discourse The Apostle Paul himself, thought it not unworthy to insert a Verse of a Greek Poet into the Text of Holy Scripture.—Heretofore, Men in highest Dignity have laboured, not a little, to be thought able to compose a Tragedy. Of that Honour Dionysius the Elder, was no less ambitious, than before, of his attaining to the Tyranny. Augustus Caesar also had begun his Ajax, but unable to please his own Judgment, left it unfinished. Sencca the Philosopher, is by some thought the Author of those Tragedies, at least the best of them that go under that Name. Gregory Nazianzen, a Father of the Church, thought it not unbeseeming the Sanctity of his Person to write a Tragedy, which is intitled, Christ Suffering. This is mentioned, to vindicate Tragedy from the small Esteem, or rather Infamy, which in the Account of many, it undergoes at this Day,"So sar the great Milton: who strengthen'd these Examples by his own. The Author hath nothing more to add, save only, that he hath aimed to write this Piece, in its essential Parts, according to the Model of ancient Tragedy, so far as modern Ideas and Manners wou'd permit. And he is so gratefully senssble of that favourable Reception it hath met with from the Public, that in every future Attempt, he will assuredly labour to merit their farther Regarcs, by keeping in his Eye the same great Originals.BARBAROSSA.ACT 1.Enter OTHMAN and a SLAVE.OTHMAN.A Stranger, say'st thou, that inquires of OTHMAN?SLAVE.He does; and waits Admittance.OTHMAN.Did he tellHis Name and Quality?SLAVE.That, he declined:But call'd himself thy Friend.OTHMAN.Where didst thou see him?SLAVE.Ev'n now, while Twilight clos'd the Day, I spy'd himMusing amid' the Ruins of yon Tow'rThat overhangs the Flood. On my Approach,With Aspect stern, and Words of Import dark,He question'd me of OTHMAN. Then the Tear
Stole from his Eye. But when I talk'd of Pow'rAnd courtly Honours here conferr'd on thee,His Frown grew darker: All I wish'd, he cry'd,Is to confer with him, and then to die.OTHMAN.What may this mean?—Conduct the Stranger to me.[Exit Slave.Perhaps some worthy Citizen, return'dFrom voluntary Exile to ALGIERS,Once known in happier Days.Enter SADI.Ah, SADI here!My honor'd Friend!SADI.Stand off—pollute me not.These honest Arms, tho' worn with Want, disdainThy gorgeous Trappings, earn'd by foul Dishonour.OTHMAN.Forbear thy rash Reproaches: for beneathThis Habit, which to thy mistaken EyeBespeaks my Guilt, I wear a Heart as trueAs SADI's to my King.SADI.Why then beneathThis cursed Roof, this black Usurper's Palace,Dar'st thou to draw infected Air, and liveThe Slave of Insolence! Why lick the DustBeneath his Feet, who laid ALGIERS in Ruin?But Age, which shou'd have taught thee honest Caution,Has taught thee Treachery!OTHMAM.Mistaken Man!Cou'd Passion prompt me to licentious SpeechLike thine—SADI.Peace, false one! Peace! The Slave to Pow'rStill wears a pliant Tongue.—O Shame to dwellWith Murder, Lust, and Rapine!—Did he notCome from the Depths of BARCA's Solitude,With fair Pretence of Faith and firm Alliance?Did not our grateful King, with open Arms,Receive him as his Guest? O fatal Hour!Did he not then with hot, adult'rous Eye,Gaze on the Queen ZAPHIRA? Yes, 'twas Lust,Lust gave th' infernal Whisper to his Soul,And bade him Murder, if he wou'd enjoy!O, complicated Horrors! hell-born Treach'ry!Then fell our Country, when good SELIM dy'd!Yet thou, pernicious Traitor, unabash'dCan'st wear the Murd'rer's Badge.OTHMAN.Yet hear me, SADI—SADI.What can Dishonour plead?OTHMAN.Yet blame not Prudence.SADI.Prudence! the stale Pretence of ev'ry Knave!The Traitor's ready Mask!OTHMAN.Yet still I love thee:Yet unprovok'd by thy intemperate Zeal.Bethink thee!—might I not insult thy FlightWith the Foul Names of Fear or Perfidy?Didst thou not fly, when BARBAROSSA's SwordReek'd with the Blood of thy brave Countrymen?What then did I?—Beneath this hated Roof,In Pity to my widow'd Queen—SADI.In Pity?OTHMAN.Yes, SADI: Heav'n is Witness, Pity sway'd me.SADI.Words, Words! Dissimulation all, and Guilt!OTHMAN.With honest Guile I did inroll my NameIn the black List of BARBAROSSA's Friends:In hope, that some propitious Hour might rise,When Heav'n would dash the Murd'rer from his Throne,And give young SELIM to his orphan'd People.SADI.Indeed! can'st thou be true?OTHMAN.By Heav'n, I am.SADI.Why then dissemble thus?OTHMAN.Have I not told thee?I held it vain, to stem the Tyrant's Pow'rBy the weak Sallies of an ill-tim'd Rage.SADI.Enough: I find thee honest: And with PrideWill join thy Councils. This, my faithful Arm,Wasted with Misery, shall gain new NervesFor brave Resolves. Can aught, my Friend, be done?Can aught be dar'd?OTHMAN.We groan beneath the Scourge.This very Morn, on false Pretence of Vengeance,For the foul Murder of our honor'd King,Five guiltless Wretches perish'd on the Rack.Our long-lov'd Friends, and bravest Citizens,Self-banish'd to the Desart, mourn in Exile:While the fell Tyrant lords it o'er a CrewOf abject Sycophants, the needy ToolsOf Pow'r usurp'd; and a degen'rate TrainOf Slaves in Arms.SADI.O my devoted Country!—But say, the widow'd Queen—my Heart bleeds for her.OTHMAN.If Pain be Life, she lives: But in such Woe,As Want and Slavery might view with Pity,And bless their happier Lot! Hemm'd round by Terrors,Within this cruel Palace, once the SeatOf ev'ry Joy, thro' sev'n long tedious Years,She weeps her murder'd Lord, her exil'd Son,Her People fall'n: the Murd'rer of her Lord,Returning now from Conquest o'er the MOORS,Tempts her to Marriage; spurr'd at once by Lust,And black Ambition. But with noble Firmness,Surpassing the female, she rejects his Vows,Scorning the horrid Union. Meantime he,With ceaseless Hate, pursues her exil'd Son;And—Oh! detested Monster![He weeps.SADI.Yet more DeedsOf Cruelty! Just Heaven!OTHMAN.His Rage pursuesThe virtuous Youth, ev'n into foreign Climes.Ere this, perhaps, he bleeds. A murd'ring RuffianIs sent to watch his Steps, and plunge the DaggerInto his guiltless Breast.SADI.Is this thy Faith!Tamely to witness to such Deeds of Horror!Give me thy Poignard; lead me to the Tyrant.What tho' surrounding Guards—OTHMAN.Repress thy Fury.Thou wilt alarm the Palace, wilt involveThyself, thy Friend, in Ruin. Haste thee hence;
Haste to the Remnant of our loyal Friends,And let maturer Councils rule thy Zeal.SADI.Yet let us ne'er forget our Prince's Wrongs.Remember, OTHMAN, (and let Vengeance rise)How in the Pangs of Death, and in his GoreWelt'ring, we found our Prince! The deadly DaggerDeep in his Heart was fix'd! His royal Blood,The Life-blood of his People, o'er the BathRan purple! O remember! and revenge!OTHMAN.Doubt not my Zeal. But haste and seek our Friends.Near to the western Port ALMANZOR dwells,Yet unseduc'd by BARBAROSSA's Pow'r.He will disclose to thee, if aught be heardOf SELIM's Safety, or (what more I dread)Of SELIM's Death. Thence best may our ResolvesBe drawn hereafter. But let Caution guide thee.For in these Walks, where Tyranny and GuiltUsurp the Throne, wakeful Suspicion dwells,And squint-ey'd Jealousy, prone to pervertEv'n Looks and Smiles to Treason.SADI.I obey thee.Near to the western Port, thou say'st.OTHMAN.Ev'n there.Close by the blasted Palm-tree, where the MosqueO'erlooks the City. Haste thee hence, my Friend.I wou'd not have thee found within these Walls.[Flourish.And hark—these warlike Sounds proclaim th' ApproachOf the proud BARBAROSSA, with his Train.Begone—SADI.May dire Disease and Pestilence
Hang o'er his Steps!—Farewel—Remember, OTHMAN,Thy Queen's, thy Prince's, and thy Country's Wrongs.[Exit SADI.OTHMAN.When I forget them, be Contempt my Lot!Yet, for the Love I bear them, I must wrapMy deep Resentments in the specious GuiseOf Smiles, and fair Deportment.Enter BARBAROSSA, Guards, &c.BARBAROSSA.Valiant OTHMAN,Are these vile Slaves impal'd?OTHMAN.My Lord, they are.BARBAROSSA.Did not the Rack extort Confession from them?OTHMAN.They dy'd obdurate: while the melting CrowdMurmur'd out Pity for their Groans and Anguish.BARBAROSSA.Curse on their womanish Hearts! what, pity SlavesWhom my supreme Decree condemn'd to Torture?Are you not all my Slaves, to whom my NodGives Life or Death?OTHMAN.To doubt thy Will, is Treason.BARBAROSSA.I love thee, faithful OTHMAN: But why sitsThat Sadness on thy Brow? For oft' I find theeMusing and sad; while Joy for my Return,My Sword victorious, and the MOOR to'erthrown,Resounds thro' all my Palace.OTHMAN.Mighty Warrior!The Soul, intent on Offices of Love,
Will oft' neglect, or scorn the weaker ProofWhich Smiles or Speech can give.BARBAROSSA.Well: Be it so.To guard ALGIERS from Anarchy's Misrule,I sway the regal Scepter. Who deserves,Shall meet Protection: And who merits not,Shall meet my Wrath in Thunder.—But 'tis strange,That when with open Arms, I wou'd receiveYoung SELIM; wou'd restore the Crown, which DeathReft from his Father's Head.—He scorns my Bounty;Shuns me with sullen and obdurate Hate,And proudly kindles War in foreign Climes,Against my Power, who sav'd his bleeding Country.OTHMAN.'Tis strange indeed—Enter ALADIN.ALADIN.Brave Prince, I bring thee TydingsOf high Concernment to ALGIERS and Thee.Young SELIM is no more.OTHMAN.Indeed!BARBAROSSA.Indeed!—why that Astonishment?He was our bitterest Foe.OTHMAN.So perish allThy causeless Enemies!BARBAROSSA.What says the Rumour?How dy'd the Prince, and where?ALADIN.The Rumour tells,That flying to ORAN, he there begg'd SuccoursFrom FERDINAND of SPAIN, t'invade ALGIERS.BARBAROSSA.From Christian Dogs!OTHMAN.How! league with Infidels!ALADIN.And there held Council with the haughty SPANIARD,To conquer and dethrone thee: But in vain:For in a dark Encounter with two Slaves,Wherein the one fell by his dauntless Valour,SELIM at length was slain.BARBAROSSA.Ungrateful Boy!Oft' have I courted him to meet my Kindness;But still in vain: he shun'd me like a Pestilence:Nor cou'd I e'er behold him, since the DownCover'd his manly Cheek.—How many YearsNumber'd he?OTHMAN.I think, scarce thirteen, when his Father dy'd,And now, some twenty.BARBAROSSA.OTHMAN, now for ProofOf undissembled Service.—Well I know,Thy long-experienc'd Faith hath plac'd thee highIn the Queen's Confidence: The Crown I wearYet totters on my Head, till Marriage-RitesHave made her mine. OTHMAN, she must be won.Plead thou my Cause of Love: Bid her dry upHer fruitless Tears: Paint forth her long Delays,Wake all thy Eloquence: Make her but mine,And such unsought Reward shall crown thy Zeal,As shall out-soar thy Wishes.OTHMAN.Mighty King,Where Duty bids, I go.BARBAROSSA.Then haste thee, OTHMAN,Ere yet the Rumour of her Son's DeceaseHath reach'd her Ear; ere yet the mournful TaleHath whelm'd her in a new Abyss of Woe,And quench'd all soft Affection, save for him.Tell her, I come, borne on the Wings of Love!—Haste—fly—I follow thee.[Exit OTHMAN.Now ALADIN.Now Fortune bears us to the wish'd-for Port:We ride secure, on her most prosp'rous Billow.This was the Rock I dreaded. Dost not thinkTh' Attempt was greatly daring?ALADIN.Ay; and necessary.What booted it, to cut the old Serpent off,While the young Adder nested in his Place?BARBAROSSA.True: We have conquer'd now. ALGIERS is mine,Without a Rival. Thus great Souls aspire;And boldly snatch at Crowns, beyond the ReachOf coward Conscience.—Yet I wonder much,OMAR returns not: OMAR, whom I sentOn this high Trust. I fear, 'tis he hath fal'n.Didst thou not say, two Slaves encounter'd SELIM?ALADIN.Ay, two: 'tis rumour'd so.BARBAROSSA.And that one fell?ALADIN.Ev'n so: By SELIM's Hand: while his CompanionPlanted his happier Steel in SELIM's Heart.BARBAROSSA.OMAR, I fear, is fal'n. From my Right-HandI gave my Signet to the trusty Slave:And bade him send it, as the certain Pledge
Of SELIM's Death; if Sickness or Captivity,Or wayward Fate, shou'd thwart his quick Return.ALADIN.The Rumour yet is young; perhaps forerunsThe trusty Slave's Approach.BARBAROSSA.We'll wait th' Event.Meantime give out, that now the widow'd QueenHath dry'd her Tears, prepar'd to crown my LoveBy Marriage-Rites: Spread wide the flatt'ring Tale:For if Persuasion win not her Consent,Pow'r shall compel.ALADIN.It is indeed a Thought,Which Prudence whispers.BARBAROSSA.Thou, brave ALADIN,Hast been the firm Companion of my Deeds:Soon shall my Friendship's Warmth reward thy Faith.—This Night my Will devotes to Feast and Joy,For Conquest o'er the MOOR. Hence, ALADIN:And see the Night-Watch close the Palace round.[Exit ALADIN.Now to the Queen. My Heart expands with Hope.Let high Ambition flourish: In SELIM's BloodIts Root is struck: From this, the rising StemProudly shall branch o'er AFRIC's Continent,And stretch from Shore to Shore.Enter IRENE.What, drown'd in Tears? still with thy Folly thwartEach purpose of my Soul? When Pleasures springBeneath our Feet, thou spurn'st the proffer'd Boon,To dwell with Sorrow.—Why these sullen Tears?IRENE.Let not these Tears offend my Father's Eye:They are the Tears of Pity. From the QueenI come, thy Suppliant.BARBAROSSA.On some rude Request.What wou'dst thou urge?IRENE.Thy dread Return from War,And proffer'd Love, have open'd ev'ry WoundThe soft and lenient Hand of Time had clos'd.If ever gentle Pity touch'd thy Heart,Now let it melt! Urge not thy harsh CommandTo see her! Her distracted Soul is bentTo mourn in Solitude. She asks no more.BARBAROSSA.She mocks my Love. How many tedious YearsHave I endur'd her Coyness? Had not War,And great Ambition, call'd me from ALGIERS,Ere this, my Pow'r had reap'd what she denies.But there's a Cause, which touches on my Peace,And bids me brook no more her false Delays.IRENE.O frown not thus! Sure, Pity ne'er deserv'dA Parent's Frown! Then look more kindly on me.Let thy consenting Pity mix with mine,And heal the Woes of weeping Majesty!Unhappy Queen!BARBAROSSA.What means that gushing Tear?IRENE.Oh never shall IRENE taste of Peace,While poor ZAPHIRA mourns!—BARBAROSSA.Is this my Child?Perverse and stubborn!—As thou lov'st thy Peace,Dry up thy Tears. What! damp the general Triumph,That echoes through ALGIERS! which now shall pierceThe vaulted Heav'n, as soon as Fame shall spreadYoung SELIM's Death, my Empire's bitterest Foe.IRENE.O generous SELIM!BARBAROSSA.Ah! There's more in this!Tell me, IRENE: On thy Duty, tell me:As thou dost wish, I wou'd not cast thee off,With an incensed Father's Curses on thee,Now tell me why, at this detested Name,Afresh thy Sorrow streams?IRENE.Yes, I will tell thee.For he is gone! and dreads thy Hate no more!My Father knows, that scarce five Moons are past,Since the MOORS seiz'd, and sold me at ORAN,A hopeless Captive in a foreign Clime!BARBAROSSA.Too well I know, and rue the fatal Day.But what of this?IRENE.Why shou'd I tell, what HorrorsDid then beset my Soul?—Oft' have I told thee,How 'midst the Throng, a Youth appear'd: His EyeBright as the Morning Star!BARBAROSSA.And was it SELIM?Did he redeem thee?IRENE.With unsparing HandHe paid th' allotted Ransom: And o'crbadeAv'rice and Appetite. At his Feet I wept,Dissolv'd in Tears of Gratitude and Joy.But when I told my Quality and Birth,He started at the Name of BARBAROSSA;And thrice turn'd pale. Yet, with Recovery mild,Go to ALGIERS, he cry'd; protect my Mother,And be to Her, what SELIM is to Thee.—
Ev'n such, my Father, was the gen'rous Youth,Who, by the Hands of bloody, bloody Men,Lies number'd with the dead.BARBAROSSA.Amazement chills me!Was this thy unknown Friend, conceal'd from me?False, faithless Child!IRENE.Cou'd Gratitude do less!He said thy Hate pursu'd him; thence conjur'd me,Not to reveal his Name.BARBAROSSA.Thou treacherous Maid!To stoop to Freedom from thy Father's Foe!IRENE.Alas, my Father!He never was thy Foe.BARBAROSSA.What!—plead for SELIM!Away. He merited the Death he found.Oh Coward! Traitress to thy Father's Glory!Thou shou'dst have liv'd a Slave,—been sold to Shame,Been banish'd to the Depth of howling Desarts,Been aught but what thou art, rather than blotA Father's Honour, by a Deed so vile:—Hence, from my Sight.—Hence, thou unthankful Child!Beware thee! Shun the Queen: nor taint her EarWith SELIM's Fate. Yes, she shall crown my Love;Or by our Prophet, she shall dread my Pow'r.[Exit BARBAROSSA.IRENE.Unhappy Queen!To what new Scenes of Horror art thou doom'd!O cruel Father! Hapless Child! whom PityCompels to call him cruel!—Gen'rous SELIM!Poor injur'd Queen! who but intreats to dieIn her dear Father's Tents! Thither, good Queen,
My Care shall speed thee, while Suspicion sleeps.What tho' my frowning Father pour his RageOn my defenceless Head? Yet InnocenceShall yield her firm Support; and conscious VirtueGild all my Days. Cou'd I but save ZAPHIRA,Let the Storm beat. I'll weep and pray, till sheAnd Heav'n forget, my Father e'er was cruel.ACT II.ZAPHIRA and female Slaves discover'd.ZAPHIRA.WHEN shall I be at Peace!—O, righteous Heav'n,Strengthen my fainting Soul, which fain wou'd riseTo Confidence in thee!—But Woes on WoesO'erwhelm me! First my Husband! now, my Son!Both dead! both slaughter'd by the bloody HandOf BARBAROSSA! Sweet Content, farewel!Farewel, sweet Hope! Grief is my Portion here!O dire Ambition! what infernal Pow'rUnchain'd thee from thy native Depth of Hell,To stalk the Earth with thy destructive Train,Murder and Lust! to waste domestic Peace,And ev'ry Heart-felt Joy!Enter OTHMAN.O faithful OTHMAN!Our Fears were true! My SELIM is no more!OTHMAN.Has then the fatal Story reach'd thine Ear?Inhuman Tyrant!ZAPHIRA.Strike him, Heav'n with Thunder!Nor let ZAPHIRA doubt thy Providence.OTHMAN.'Twas what we fear'd. Accuse not Heav'n's high Will,Nor struggle with the ten-fold Chain of Fate,That links thee to thy Woes! O, rather yield,And wait the happier Hour, when InnocenceShall weep no more. Rest in that pleasing Hope,And yield thyself to Heav'n.—My honor'd Queen,The King—ZAPHIRA.Whom stil'st thou King?OTHMAN.'Tis BARBAROSSA.He means to see thee—ZAPHIRA.Curses blast the Tyrant!Does he assume the Name of King?OTHMAN.He does.ZAPHIRA.O Title vilely purchas'd! by the BloodOf Innocence! By Treachr'y and Murder!May Heav'n incens'd pour down its Vengeance on him;Blast all his Joys, and turn them into Horror;Till Phrenzy rise, and bid him curse the HourThat gave his Crimes their Birth! My faithful OTHMAN,My sole surviving Prop! Can'st thou deviseNo secret Means, by which I may escapeThis hated Palace! with undaunted StepI'd roam the Waste, to reach my Father's ValesOf dear MUTIJA!—Can no means be found,To fly these black'ning Horrors that surround me?OTHMAN.That Hope is vain! The Tyrant knows thy Hate.Hence, Day and Night, his watchful Guards surround thee,Impenetrable as Walls of Adamant.Curb then thy mighty Griefs: Justice and TruthHe mocks as Shadows: Rouse not then, his Anger:Let soft Persuasion and mild Eloquence,Redeem that Liberty, which stern RebukeWou'd rob thee of for ever.ZAPHIRA.Cruel Task!For Royalty to bow,—an injur'd Queen
To kneel for Liberty! And, Oh! to whom!Ev'n to the Murd'rer of her Lord and Son!O perish first, ZAPHIRA! Yes, I'll die!For what is Life to me! My dear, dear Lord!My hapless Child! Yes, I will follow you.OTHMAN.Wilt thou not see him, then?ZAPHIRA.I will not, OTHMAN.Or if I do, with bitter Imprecation,More keen than Poison shot from Serpents Tongues,I'll pour my Curses on him!OTHMAN.Will ZAPHIRAThus meanly sink in Woman's fruitless Rage,When she should wake Revenge?ZAPHIRA.Revenge?—O tell me—Tell me but how! what can a helpless Woman!OTHMAN.Gain but the Tyrant's leave, and reach thy Father:Pour thy Complaints before him: Let thy WrongsKindle his Indignation, to pursueThis vil e Usurper, till unceasing WarBlast his ill-gotten Pow'r.ZAPHIRA.[Rising.Ah!—say'st thou, OTHMAN?Thy Words have shot like Lightning through my Frame;And all my Soul's on Fire!—Thou faithful Friend!Yes; with more gentle Speech I'll sooth his Pride;Regain my Freedom; seek my Father's Tents;There paint my countless Woes. His kindling RageShall wake the Vallies into honest Vengeance:The sudden Storm shall pour on BARBAROSSA;And ev'ry glowing Warrior steep his ShaftIn deadlier Poison, to revenge my Wrongs.OTHMAN.There spoke the Queen. But as thou lov'st thy Freedom,Touch not on SELIM's Fate. Thy Soul will kindle,And Passion mount in Flames that will consume thee.ZAPHIRA.My murder'd Son! yes, to revenge thy Death,I'll speak a Language which my Heart disdains.OTHMAN.Peace, Peace! The Tyrant comes: Now, injur'd Queen,Plead for thy Freedom, hope for just Revenge,And check each rising Passion![Exit OTHMAN.Enter BARBAROSSA.BARBAROSSA.Hail, sov'reign Fair! Thrice honor'd Queen! in whomBeauty and Majesty conspire to charm!Behold the Conqu'ror, whose deciding VoiceCan speak the Fate of Kingdoms, at thy FeetLies conquer'd by thy Pow'r!ZAPHIRA.O BARBAROSSA!No more the Pride of Conquest e'er can charmMy widow'd Heart! With my departed LordMy Love lies bury'd! I should meet thy FlameWith sullen Tears, and cold Indifference.Then turn thee to some happier Fair, whose HeartMay crown thy growing Love, with Love sincere;For I have none to give!BARBAROSSA.Love ne'er shou'd die:'Tis the Soul's Cordial: 'Tis the Fount of Life;Therefore shou'd spring eternal in the Breast.One Object lost, another shou'd succeed.And all our Life be Love.ZAPHIRA.Urge me no more:—Thou might'st with equal Hope
Woo the cold Marble weeping o'er a Tomb,To meet thy Wishes! But if gen'rous LoveDwell in thy Breast, vouchsafe me Proof sincere:Give me safe Convoy to my native ValesOf dear MUTIJA, where my Father reigns.BARBAROSSA.O blind to proffer'd Bliss! what, fondly quitThis lofty Palace, and the envy'd PompOf Empire, for an Arab's wand'ring Tent!Where the mock Chieftain leads his vagrant TribesFrom Plain to Plain, as Thirst or Famine sways;Obscurely vain; and faintly shadows outThe Majesty of Kings!—Far other JoysHere shall attend thy Call: The winged BarkFor thee shall traverse Seas; and ev'ry ClimeBe tributary to ZAPHIRA's Charms.To Thee, exalted Fair, submissive RealmsShall bow the Neck; and swarthy Kings and Queens,From the far-distant NIGER and the NILE,Drawn captive at my conqu'ring Charriot-Wheels,Shall kneel before thee.ZAPHIRA.Pomp and Pow'r are Toys,Which ev'n the Mind at ease may well disdain.But, ah! what Mockery is the tinsel PrideOf Splendor, when by wasting Woes, the MindLies desolate within!—Such, such, is mine!O'erwhelm'd with Ills, and dead to ev'ry JoyEnvy me not this last Request, to dieIn my dear Father's Tents!BARBAROSSA.Thy Suit is vain—ZAPHIRA.Thus kneeling, at thy Feet—!BARBAROSSA.Thou thankless Fair!Thus to repay the Labours of my Love!Had I not siez'd the Throne when SELIM dy'd,
Ere this, thy Foes had laid ALGIERS in Ruin:I check'd the warring Pow'rs, and gave you Peace.ZAPHIRA.Peace dost thou call it! what can worse be fear'dFrom the War's Rage, than Violence and Blood?Have not unceasing Horrors mark'd thy Reign?Thro' sev'n long Years, thy slaught'ring Sword hath reek'dWith guiltless Blood.BARBAROSSA.With guiltless Blood?—Take heed—Rouse not my slumb'ring Rage: Nor vindicateThy Country's Guilt and Treason.ZAPHIRA.Where Violence reigns, there Innocence is Guilt,And Virtue, Treason.—Know, ZAPHIRA scornsThy Menace.—Yes,—thy slaught'ring Sword hath reek'dWith guiltless Blood. Thro'thee, Exile and DeathHave thin'd ALGIERS. Is this thy boasted Peace?So might the Tyger boast the Peace he bringsWhen he o'erleaps by Stealth, and wastes the Fold.BARBAROSSA.Ungrateful Queen! I'll give thee Proof of Love,Beyond thy Sex's Pride! But make thee mine,I will descend the Throne, and call thy SonFrom Banishment to Empire.ZAPHIRA.Oh, my Heart!Can I bear this!—Inhuman Tyrant! Curses on thy Head!May dire Remorse and Anguish haunt thy Throne,And gender in thy Bosom fell Despair!Despair as deep as mine!BARBAROSSA.What means ZAPHIRA?What means this Burst of Grief?ZAPHIRA.Thou fell Destroyer!
Had not Guilt steel'd thy Heart, awak'ning ConscienceWou'd flash Conviction on thee, and each Look,Shot from these Eyes, be arm'd with Serpent-Horrors,To turn thee into Stone!—Relentless Man!Who did the bloody Deed? Oh, tremble Guilt,Where'er thou art!—Look on me!—Tell me, Tyrant,—Who slew my blameless Son?BARBAROSSA.What envious Tongue,My Foe, hath dar'd to taint my Name with Slander?This is the Rumour of some coz'ning Slave,Who thwarts my Peace. Believe it not, ZAPHIRA.Thy SELIM lives: nay more, he soon shall reign,If thou consent to bless me.ZAPHIRA.Never! Oh, never—Sooner wou'd I roamAn unknown Exile thro' the torrid ClimesOf AFRIC, sooner dwell with Wolves and Tygers,Than mount with thee my murder'd SELIM's Throne!BARBAROSSA.Rash Queen, forbear! Think on thy Captive-State:Remember, that within these Palace-Walls,I am omnipotent: That every KneeBends at my dread Approach: That Shame and Honour,Reward and Punishment, await my Nod,The Vassals of my Pleasure.—Yield thee then:Avert the gath'ring Horrors that surround thee,And dread my Pow'r incens'd.ZAPHIRA.Dares thy licentious Tongue pollute mine EarWith that foul Menace?—Tyrant! Dread'st thou notTh' all seeing Eye of Heav'n, its lifted Thunder,And all the red'ning Vengeance which it storesFor Crimes like thine?—Yet know, thy Threats are vain.Tho' robb'd by thee of ev'ry dear Support;No Tyrant's Threat can awe the free-born Soul,That greatly dares to Die.[Exit ZAPHIRA.BARBAROSSA.Where should she learn the Tale of SELIM's Death?Cou'd OTHMAN dare to tell it? If he did,My Rage shall sweep him, swifter than the Whirlwind,To instant Death!—Curse on her Steadiness!She lords it o'er my Heart. There is a CharmOf Majesty in Virtue, that disarmsReluctant Pow'r, and bends the struggling WillFrom her most firm Resolve.Enter ALADIN.Oh, ALADIN!Timely thou com'st, to ease my lab'ring Thought,That swells with Indignation and Despair.This stubborn Woman—ALADIN.What, unconquer'd still?BARBAROSSA.The News of SELIM's Fate hath reach'd her Ear.Whence could this come?ALADIN.I can resolve thy Doubt.A female Slave, Attendant on ZAPHIRA,O'erheard the Messenger who brought the Tale,And gave it to her Ear.BARBAROSSA.Perdition sieze her!No Threat can move, nor Promise now allureHer haughty Soul: Nay, she defies my Pow'r:And talks of Death, as if her female FormInshrin'd some Hero's Spirit.ALADIN.Let her Rage foam.I bring thee Tydings that will ease thy Pain.BARBAROSSA.Say'st thou?—Speak on—O give me quick Relief!—ALADIN.The gallant Youth is come, who slew her Son.BARBAROSSA.Who? OMAR!ALADIN.No: Unhappy OMAR fellBy SELIM's Hand. But ACHMET, whom he join'dHis brave Associate, so the Youth bids tell thee,Reveng'd his Death by SELIM's.BARBAROSSA.Gallant Youth!Bears he the Signet?ALADIN.Aye.BARBAROSSA.That speaks him true.—Conduct him, ALADIN.[Exit ALADIN.This is beyond my Hope. The secret PledgeRestor'd, prevents Suspicion of the Deed,While it confirms it done.Enter ACHMET and ALADIN.ACHMET.Hail mighty BARBAROSSA! As the Pledge[Kneels.Of SELIM's Death, behold thy Ring restor'd:That Pledge will speak the rest.BARBAROSSA.Rise, valiant Youth!But first, no more a Slave—I give thee Freedom.Thou art the Youth whom OMAR (now no more)Join'd his Companion in this brave Attempt?ACHMET.I am.BARBAROSSA.Then tell me how you sped.—Where found yeThat Insolent!ACHMET.We found him at ORAN,Plotting deep Mischiefs to thy Throne and People.BARBAROSSA.Well ye repaid the Traitor.—ACHMET.As we ought.While Night drew on, we leapt upon our Prey.Full at his Heart brave OMAR aim'd the Poignard,Which SELIM shunning, wrench'd it from his Hand,Then plung'd it in his Breast. I hasted on.Too late to save, yet I reveng'd my Friend:My thirsty Dagger, with repeated Blow,Search'd ev'ry Artery: They fell together,Gasping in Folds of mortal Enmity;And thus in Frowns expir'd.BARBAROSSA.Well hast thou sped.Thy Dagger did its Office, faithful ACHMET;And high Reward shall wait thee.—One thing more—Be the Thought fortunate!—Go, seek the Queen.For know the Rumour of her SELIM's DeathHath reach'd her Ear: Hence dark Suspicions rise,Squinting at me. Go, tell her, that thou saw'stHer Son expire; that with his dying Breath,He did conjure her to receive my Vows,And give her Country Peace.—That, sure will lullSuspicion. ALADIN, that sure will win her.ALADIN.'Tis wisely thought.—It must.Enter OTHMAN.BARBAROSSA.Most welcome, OTHMAN.Behold this gallant Stranger. He hath doneThe State good Service. Let some high RewardAwait him, such as may o'erpay his Zeal.Conduct him to the Queen; for he hath TidingsWorthy her Ear, from her departed Son;Such as may win her Love.—Come, ALADIN:The Banquet waits our Presence: Festal Joy
Laughs in the mantling Goblet; and the Night,Illumin'd by the Taper's dazzling Beam,Rivals departed Day.[Ex.

Read'st not in mine EyeRemorseless Fury?—I am SELIM's Murd'rer.OTHMAN.His Murd'rer!ACHMET.Start not from me.My Dagger thirsts not but for regal Blood.Why this Amazement?OTHMAN.Amazement?—No—'Tis well:—'tis as it should be—He was indeed a Foe to BARBAROSSA.ACHMET.And therefore to ALGIERS:—Was it not so?—Why dost thou pause? What Passion shakes thy Frame?OTHMAN.Fate, do thy worst!—I can no more dissemble!—Can I unmov'd behold the murd'ring Russian,Smear'd with my Prince's Blood!—Go, tell the Tyrant,OTHMAN defies his Pow'r; that tir'd with LifeHe dares his bloody Hand, and pleads to die.ACHMET.What, didst thou love this SELIM?OTHMAN.All Men lov'd him.
He was of such unmix'd and blameless Quality,That Envy, at his Praise stood mute, nor dar'dTo sully his fair Name! Remorseless Tyrant!ACHMET.I do commend thy Faith. And since thou lov'st him,I'll whisper to thee, that with honest GuileI have deceiv'd this Tyrant BARBAROSSA:SELIM is yet alive.OTHMAN.Alive!ACHMET.Nay, more—SELIM is in ALGIERS.OTHMAN.Impossible!ACHMET.Why, if thou doubt'st, I'll bring him hither, straight.OTHMAN.Not for an Empire!Thou might'st as well bring the devoted LambInto the Tyger's Den.ACHMET.Nay, but I'll bring himHid in such deep Disguise, as shall derideSuspicion, tho' she wear the Lynx's Eye:Not ev'n thyself couldst know him.OTHMAN.Yes, sure: too sure, to hazard such an awful Trial!ACHMET.Yet seven revolving Years, worn outIn tedious Exile, may have wrought such ChangeOf Voice and Feature, in the State of Youth,As might elude thine Eye.OTHMAN.No Time can blotThe Mem'ry of his sweet majestic Mien,The Lustre of his Eye! Nay, more, he wears
A Mark indelible, a beauteous Scar,Made on his Forehead by a surious Pard,Which rushing on his Mother, SELIM slew.ACHMET.A Scar!OTHMAN.Ay, on his Forehead.ACHMET.What, like this?[Lifting his Turban.OTHMAN.Whom do I see!—am I awake!—my Prince![Kneels.My honor'd, honor'd King!SELIM.Rise, faithful OTHMAN.Thus let me thank thy Truth![Embraces him.OTHMAN.Oh, happy Hour!SELIM.Why dost thou tremble thus? Why grasp my Hand?And why that ardent Gaze? Thou canst not doubt me?OTHMAN.Ah, no! I see thy Sire in ev'ry Line.—How did my Prince escape the Murd'rer's Hand?SELIM.I wrench'd the Dagger from him; and gave backThat Death he meant to bring. The Russian woreThe Tyrant's Signet:—Take this Ring, he cry'd,The sole Return my dying Hand can make theeFor its accurs'd Attempt: This Pledge restor'd,Will prove thee slain: Safe may'st thou see ALGIERS,Unknown to all.—This said, th'Assassin dy'd.OTHMAN.But how to gain Admittance, thus unknown?SELIM.Disguis'd as SELIM's Murderer I come:Th' Accomplice of the Deed: The Ring restor'd,Gain'd Credence to my Words.OTHMAN.Yet e'er thou cam'st, thy Death was rumour'd here.SELIM.I spread the flatt'ring Tale, and sent it hither;That babbling Rumour, like a lying Dream,Might make Belief more easy.

Comes such exalted Virtue, as dares giveA Pause to Griefs like mine!—As dares approach,And prop the Ruin tott'ring on its Base,Which selfish Caution shuns!—Oh, say—who art thou?SELIM.A friendless Youth, self-banish'd with thy Son;Long his Companion in Distress and Danger:One who rever'd thy Worth in prosp'rous Days:And more reveres thy Virtue in Distress.ZAPHIRA.O tell me truly then—mock not my Woes,But tell me truly,—does my SELIM live?SELIM.He does, by Heav'n!ZAPHIRA.And does he still rememberHis Father's Wrongs, and mine!SELIM.He bade me tell thee,That in his Heart indelibly are stamp'dHis Father's Wrongs, and Thine: That he but waits'Till awful Justice may unsheath her Sword,And Lust and Murder tremble at her Frown!'That till th' Arrival of that happy Hour,Deep in his Soul the hidden Fire shall glow,And his Breast labour with the great Revenge!ZAPHIRA.Eternal Blessings crown my virtuous Son!I feel my Heart revive!

Thou hast at length o'erpay'dMy bitt'rest Pangs; if my dear SELIM lives,And lives for me!—hear my departing Pray'r![Kneels.O spare my Son!—Protect his tender Years!Be thou his Guide through Dangers and Distress!Soften the Rigours of his cruel Exile,And lead him to his Throne!—when I am gone,Bless thou his peaceful Reign! Oh, early bless himWith the sweet Pledges of connubial Love;That he may win his Virtue's just Reward,And taste the Raptures which a Parent's HeartReaps from a Child like him! Not for myself,—But my dear Son,—accept my parting Tears![Exit ZAPHIRA.SELIM.Now, swelling Heart,Indulge the Luxury of Grief! Flow Tears!And rain down Transport in the Shape of Sorrow!Yes, I have sooth'd her Woes; have found her Noble:And to have giv'n this Respite to her Pangs,O'erpays all Pain and Peril!—Pow'rful Virtue!How infinite thy Joys, when ev'n thy GriefsAre pleasing!—Thou, superior to the Frowns
Of Fate, can'st pour thy Sunshine o'er the Soul,And brighten Woe to Rapture!Enter OTHMAN and SADI.Honor'd Friends!How goes the Night?SADI.'Tis well nigh Midnight.OTHMAN.What—in Tears, my Prince?SELIM.But Tears of Joy: For I have seen ZAPHIRA,And pour'd the Balm of Peace into her Breast:Think not these Tears unnerve me, valiant Friends:They have but harmoniz'd my Soul; and wak'dAll that is Man within me, to disdainPeril, or Death.—What Tydings from the City?SADI.All, all is ready. Our confed'rate FriendsBurn with Impatience, till the Hour arrive.SELIM.What is the Signal of th' appointed Hour?SADI.The Midnight Watch gives Signal of our Meeting:And when the second Watch of Night is rung,The work of Death begins.SELIM.Speed, speed ye Minutes!Now let the rising Whirlwind shake ALGIERS,And Justice guide the storm! Scarce two Hours hence.—SADI.Scarce more than one.SELIM.But as ye love my Life,Let your Zeal hasten on the great Event:The Tyrant's Daughter found, and knew me here;And half suspects the Cause.OTHMAN.Too daring Prince,Retire with us! Her Fears will sure betray thee!SELIM.What? leave my helpless Mother, here, a PreyTo Cruelty and Lust?—I'll perish first:This very Night the Tyrant threatens Violence:I'll watch his Steps: I'll haunt him thro' the Palace:And, shou'd he meditate a Deed so vile,I'll hover o'er him like an unseen Pestilence,And blast him in his Guilt!SADI.Intrepid Prince!Worthy of Empire!—Yet accept my Life,My worthless Life: Do thou retire with OTHMAN;I will protect ZAPHIRA.SELIM.Think'st thou, SADI,That when the trying Hour of Peril comes,SELIM will shrink into a common Man!Worthless were he to rule, who dares not claimPre-eminence in Danger. Urge no more.Here shall my Station be: And if I fall,O Friends, let me have Vengeance!—Tell me now,Where is the Tyrant?OTHMAN.Revelling at the Banquet.SELIM.'Tis good.—Now tell me, how our Pow'rs are destin'd?SADI.Near ev'ry Port, a secret Band is posted:By these the watchful Centinels must perish:The rest is easy: For the glutted TroopsLie drown'd in Sleep; the Dagger's cheapest Prey.ALMANZOR, with his Friends, will circle roundThe Avenues of the Palace. OTHMAN and IWill lead our brave Confederates (all sworn
To conquer or to die) and burst the GatesOf this foul Den. Then tremble BARBAROSSA!SELIM.Oh, how the near Approach of this great HourFires all my Soul! But, valiant Friends, I charge you,Reserve the Murd'rer to my just Revenge;My Poignard claims his Blood.OTHMAN.Forgive me, Prince!Forgive my Doubts!—Think—shou'd the fair IRENE—SELIM.Thy Doubts are vain. I wou'd not spare the Tyrant,Tho' the sweet Maid lay weeping at my Feet!Nay, shou'd he fall by any Hand but mine;By Heav'n, I'd think my honor'd Father's BloodScarce half reveng'd! My Love indeed is strong!But Love shall yield to Justice!SADI.Gallant Prince!Bravely resolv'd!SELIM.But is the City quiet?SADI.All, all is hush'd. Throughout the empty Streets,Nor Voice, nor Sound.

But oh, rememberAmid' Tumult's Rage, remember Mercy!Stain not a righteous Cause with guiltless Blood!Warn our brave Friends, that we unsheath the Sword,Not to destroy, but save! Nor let blind Zeal,Or wanton Cruelty, e'er turn its EdgeOn Age or Innocence! Or bid us stab,Where the most pitying Angel in the SkiesThat now looks on us from his blest Abode,Wou'd wish that we shou'd spare.OTHMAN.So may we prosper,As Mercy shall direct us!SELIM.Farewel, Friends!SADI.Intrepid Prince, Farewel![Ex.
