DESIGNS, &c.DESIGNS BY Mr. R. BENTLEY, FOR SIX POEMS BY Mr. T. GRAY.Frontispiece to first OdeLONDON: Printed for R. DODSLEY, in Pall-mall. MDCCLIII.ODE.LO! where the rosy-bosom'd Hours,Fair VENUS' train appear,Disclose the long-expecting flowers,And wake the purple year!The Attic warbler pours her throat,Responsive to the cuckow's note,The untaught harmony of spring:While whisp'ring pleasure as they fly,Cool Zephyrs thro' the clear blue skyTheir gather'd fragrance fling.Where'er the oak's thick branches stretchA broader browner shade;Where'er the rude and moss-grown beechO'er-canopies the glade;Beside some water's rushy brinkWith me the Muse shall sit, and think(At ease reclin'd in rustic state)How vain the ardour of the Crowd,How low, how little are the Proud,How indigent the Great!Still is the toiling hand of Care:The panting herds repose:Yet hark, how thro' the peopled airThe busy murmur glows!The insect youth are on the wing,Eager to taste the honied spring,
And float amid the liquid noon:Some lightly o'er the current skim,Some shew their gayly-gilded trimQuick-glancing to the sun.To Contemplation's sober eyeSuch is the race of Man:And they that creep, and they that fly,Shall end where they began.Alike the Busy and the GayBut flutter thro' life's little day,In fortune's varying colours drest:Brush'd by the hand of rough Mischance,Or chill'd by age, their airy danceThey leave, in dust to rest.Methinks I hear in accents lowThe sportive kind reply:Poor moralist! and what art thou?A solitary fly!
Thy Joys no glittering female meets,No hive hast thou of hoarded sweets,No painted plumage to display:On hasty wings thy youth is flown;Thy sun is set, thy spring is gone—We frolick, while 'tis May.A FAVORITE HAS NO FRIENDT.G.R.B.ODE On the Death of a Favourite CAT, Drowned in a Tub of Gold Fishes.TWAS on a lofty vase's side,Where China's gayest art had dy'dThe azure flowers, that blow;Demurest of the tabby kind,The pensive Selima reclin'd,Gazed on the lake below.Her conscious tail her joy declar'd;The fair round face, the snowy beard,The velvet of her paws,Her coat, that with the tortoise vies,Her ears of jet, and emerald eyes,She saw; and purr'd applause.Still had she gaz'd: but 'midst the tideTwo angel forms were seen to glide,The Genii of the stream:Their scaly armour's Tyrian hueThro' richest purple to the viewBetray'd a golden gleam.The hapless Nymph with wonder saw:A whisker first and then a claw,With many an ardent wish,She stretch'd in vain to reach the prize.What female heart can gold despise?What Cat's averse to fish?Presumptuous Maid! with looks intentAgain she stretch'd, again she bent,Nor knew the gulf between.(Malignant Fate sat by, and smil'd)The slipp'ry verge her feet beguil'd,She tumbled headlong in.Eight times emerging from the floodShe mew'd to ev'ry watry God,Some speedy aid to send.
No Dolphin came, no Nereid stirr'd:Nor cruel Tom, or Susan heard.A Fav'rite has no friend!From hence, ye Beauties, undeceiv'd,Know, one false step is ne'er retriev'd,And be with caution bold.Not all that tempts your wand'ring eyesAnd heedless hearts, is lawful prize;Nor all, that glisters, gold.AH TELL THEM THEY ARE MENJ. S. Müller sc:ODE On a Distant Prospect of ETON COLLEGE.YE distant spires, ye antique towers,That crown the watry glade,Where grateful Science still adoresHer HENRY's holy Shade;And ye, that from the stately browOf WINDSOR's heights th' expanse belowOf grove, of lawn, of mead survey,Whose turf, whose shade, whose flowers amongWanders the hoary Thames alongHis silver-winding way.Ah happy hills, ah pleasing shade,Ah fields belov'd in vain,Where once my careless childhood stray'd,A stranger yet to pain!I feel the gales, that from ye blow,A momentary bliss bestow,As waving fresh their gladsome wing,My weary soul they seem to sooth,And, redolent of joy and youth,To breath a second spring.Say, Father THAMES, for thou hast seenFull many a sprightly raceDisporting on thy margent greenThe paths of pleasure trace,Who foremost now delight to cleaveWith pliant arm thy glassy wave?The captive linnet which enthrall?What idle progeny succeedTo chase the rolling circle's speed,Or urge the flying ball?While some on earnest business bentTheir murm'ring labours ply'Gainst graver hours, that bring constraintTo sweeten liberty:Some bold adventurers disdainThe limits of their little reign,And unknown regions dare descry:Still as they run they look behind,They hear a voice in every wind,And snatch a fearful joy.Gay hope is theirs by fancy fed,Less pleasing when possest;The tear forgot as soon as shed,The sunshine of the breast:Theirs buxom health of rosy hue,Wild wit, invention ever-new,And lively chear of vigour born;The thoughtless day, the easy night,The spirits pure, the slumbers light,That fly th' approach of morn.Alas, regardless of their doom,The little victims play!No sense have they of ills to come,Nor care beyond to-day:Yet see how all around 'em waitThe Ministers of human fate,And black Misfortune's baleful train!Ah, shew them where in ambush standTo seize their prey the murth'rous band!Ah, tell them, they are men!These shall the fury Passions tear,The vulturs of the mind,Disdainful Anger, pallid Fear,And Shame that sculks behind;Or pineing Love shall waste their youth,Or Jealousy with rankling tooth,That inly gnaws the secret heart,And Envy wan, and faded Care,Grim-visag'd comfortless Despair,And Sorrow's piercing dart.Ambition this shall tempt to rise,Then whirl the wretch from high,To bitter Scorn a sacrifice,And grinning Infamy.The stings of Falshood those shall try,And hard Unkindness' alter'd eye,That mocks the tear it forc'd to flow;And keen Remorse with blood defil'd,And moody Madness laughing wildAmidst severest woe.Lo, in the vale of years beneathA griesly troop are seen,The painful family of Death,More hideous than their Queen:This racks the joints, this fires the veins,That every labouring sinew strains,Those in the deeper vitals rage:Lo, Poverty, to fill the band,That numbs the soul with icy hand,And slow-consuming Age.To each his suff'rings: all are men,Condemn'd alike to groan,The tender for another's pain;Th' unfeeling for his own.Yet ah! why should they know their fate?Since sorrow never comes too late,And happiness too swiftly flies.Thought would destroy their paradise.No more; where ignorance is bliss,'Tis folly to be wise.J. S. Müller sc. A LONG STORY.IN BRITAIN's Isle, no matter where,An ancient pile of building stands:The Huntingdons and Hattons thereEmploy'd the power of Fairy handsTo raise the cieling's fretted height,Each pannel in achievements cloathing,Rich windows that exclude the light,And passages, that lead to nothing.Full oft within the spatious walls,When he had fifty winters o'er him,My grave Hatton, prefer'd by Queen Elizabeth for his graceful Person and fine Dancing. Lord-Keeper led the Brawls:The Seal, and Maces, danc'd before him.His bushy beard, and shoe-strings green,His high-crown'd hat, and sattin-doublet,Mov'd the stout heart of England's Queen,Tho' Pope and Spaniard could not trouble it.What, in the very first beginning!Shame of the versifying tribe!Your Hist'ry whither are you spinning?Can you do nothing but describe?A House there is, (and that's enough)From whence one fatal morning issuesA brace of Warriors, not in buff,But rustling in their silks and tissues.The first came cap-a-pee from FranceHer conqu'ring destiny fulfilling,Whom meaner Beauties eye askance,And vainly ape her art of killing.The other Amazon kind HeavenHad arm'd with spirit, wit, and satire:But COBHAM had the polish given,And tip'd her arrows with good-nature.To celebrate her eyes, her air—Coarse panegyricks would but teaze her.Melissa is her Nom de Guerre.Alas, who would not wish to please her!With bonnet blue and capucine,And aprons long they hid their armour,And veil'd their weapons bright and keenIn pity to the country-farmer.Fame in the shape of Mr. Pt(By this time all the Parish know it)Had told, that thereabouts there lurk'dA wicked Imp they call a Poet,Who prowl'd the country far and near,Bewitch'd the children of the peasants,Dried up the cows, and lam'd the deer,And suck'd the eggs, and kill'd the pheasants.My Lady heard their joint petition,Swore by her coronet and ermine,She'd issue out her high commissionTo rid the manour of such vermin.The Heroines undertook the task,Thro'lanes unknown, o'er stiles they ventur'd,Rap'd at the door, nor stay'd to ask,But bounce into the parlour enter'd.The trembling family they daunt,They flirt, they sing, they laugh, they tattle,Rummage his Mother, pinch his Aunt,And up stairs in a whirlwind rattle.Each hole and cupboard they explore,Each creek and cranny of his chamber,Run hurry-skurry round the floor,And o'er the bed and tester clamber,Into the Drawers and China pry,Papers and books, a huge Imbroglio!Under a tea-cup he might lie,Or creased, like dogs-ears, in a folio.On the first marching of the troopsThe Muses, hopeless of his pardon,Convey'd him underneath their hoopsTo a small closet in the garden.So Rumor says. (Who will, believe.)But that they left the door a-jarr,Where, safe and laughing in his sleeve,He heard the distant din of war.Short was his joy. He little knew,The power of Magick was no fable.Out of the window, whisk, they flew,But left a spell upon the table.The words too eager to unriddleThe Poet felt a strange disorder:Transparent birdlime form'd the middle,And chains invisible the border.So cunning was the Apparatus,The powerful pothooks did so move him,That, will he, nill he, to the Great-houseHe went, as if the Devil drove him.Yet on his way (no sign of grace,For folks in fear are apt to pray)To Phoebus he prefer'd his case,And beg'd his aid that dreadful day.The Godhead would have back'd his quarrel,But with a blush on recollectionOwn'd, that his quiver and his laurel'Gainst four such eyes were no protection.The Court was sate, the Culprit there,Forth from their gloomy mansions creepingThe Lady Janes and Joans repair,And from the gallery stand peeping:Such as in silence of the nightCome (sweep) along some winding entry(The HOUSE-KEEPER.Styack has often seen the sight)Or at the chappel-door stand sentry;In peaked hoods and mantles tarnish'd,Sour visages, enough to scare ye,High Dames of honour once, that garnish'dThe drawing-room of fierce Queen Mary!The Peeress comes. The Audience stare,And doff their hats with due submission:She curtsies, as she takes her chair,To all the People of condition.The Bard with many an artful fib,Had in imagination fenc'd him,Disprov'd the arguments of Groom of the Chambers.Squib,And all that The Steward.Groom could urge against him.But soon his rhetorick forsook him,When he the solemn hall had seen;A sudden fit of ague shook him,He stood as mute as poor A famous Highwayman hang'd the week before.Macleane.Yet something he was heard to mutter,'How in the park beneath an old-tree'(Without design to hurt the butter,'Or any malice to the poultry,)'He once or twice had pen'd a sonnet;'Yet hoped, that he might save his bacon:'Numbers would give their oaths upon it,'He ne'er was for a conj'rer taken.The ghostly Prudes with hagged faceAlready had condemn'd the sinner.My Lady rose, and with a grace—She smiled, and bid him come to dinner.'Jesu-Maria! Madam Bridget,'Why, what can the Vicountess mean?(Cried the square Hoods in woful fidget)'The times are alter'd quite and clean!'Decorum's turn'd to mere civility;'Her air and all her manners shew it.'Commend me to her affability!'Speak to a Commoner and Poet![Here 500 Stanzas are lost.]And so God save our noble King,And guard us from long-winded Lubbers,That to eternity would sing,And keep my Lady from her Rubbers.J. S. Müller sc. HYMN to ADVERSITY.DAUGHTER of JOVE, relentless Power,Thou Tamer of the human breast,Whose iron scourge and tort'ring hourThe Bad affright, afflict the Best!Bound in thy adamantine chainThe Proud are taught to taste of pain,And purple Tyrants vainly groanWith pangs unfelt before, unpitied and alone.When first thy Sire to send on earthVirtue, his darling Child, design'd,To thee he gave the heav'nly Birth,And bad to form her infant mind.Stern rugged Nurse! thy rigid loreWith patience many a year she bore:What sorrow was, thou bad'st her know,And from her own she learn'd to melt at other's woe.Scared at thy frown terrific, flySelf-pleasing Folly's idle brood,Wild Laughter, Noise, and thoughtless Joy,And leave us leisure to be good.Light they disperse, and with them goThe summer Friend, the flatt'ring Foe;By vain Prosperity received,To her they vow their truth, and are again believed.Wisdom in sable garb array'dImmers'd in rapt'rous thought profound,And Melancholy, silent maidWith leaden eye, that loves the ground,Still on thy solemn steps attend:Warm Charity, the gen'ral friend,With Justice to herself severe,And Pity, dropping soft the sadly-pleasing tear.Oh, gently on thy Suppliant's head,Dread Goddess, lay thy chast'ning hand!Not in thy Gorgon terrors clad,Nor circled with the vengeful Band(As by the Impious thou art seen)With thund'ring voice, and threat'ning mien,With screaming Horror's funeral cry,Despair, and fell Disease, and ghastly Poverty.Thy form benign, oh Goddess, wear,Thy milder influence impart,Thy philosophic Train be thereTo soften, not to wound my heart,The gen'rous spark extinct revive,Teach me to love and to forgive,Exact my own defects to scan,What others are, to feel, and know myself a Man.C. Grignion sculp.C. Grignion. sculp. ELEGY WRITTEN IN A COUNTRY CHURCH YARD.THE Curfew tolls the knell of parting day,The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea,The plowman homeward plods his weary way,And leaves the world to darkness and to me.Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,And all the air a solemn stillness holds,Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds;Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tow'rThe mopeing owl does to the moon complainOf such, as wand'ring near her secret bow'r,Molest her ancient solitary reign.Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap,Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,The rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep.The breezy call of incense-breathing Morn,The swallow twitt'ring from the straw-built shed,The cock's shrill clarion, or the ecchoing horn,No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,Or busy houswife ply her evening care:No children run to lisp their sire's return,Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;How jocund did they drive their team afield!How bow'd the woods beneath their study stroke!Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile,The short and simple annals of the poor.The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r,And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,Awaits alike th' inevitable hour.The paths of glory lead but to the grave.Nor you, ye Proud, impute to These the fault,If Mem'ry o'er their Tomb no Trophies raise,Where thro' the long-drawn isle and fretted vaultThe pealing anthem swells the note of praise.Can storied urn or animated bustBack to its mansion call the fleeting breath?Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust,Or Flatt'ry sooth the dull cold ear of Death!Perhaps in this neglected spot is laidSome heart once pregnant with celestial fire,Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd,Or wak'd to extasy the living lyre.But Knowledge to their eyes her ample pageRich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll;Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage,And froze the genial current of the soul.Full many a gem of purest ray serene,The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear:Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air.Some village-Hampden, that with dauntless breastThe little Tyrant of his fields withstood;Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.Th' applause of list'ning senates to command,The threats of pain and ruin to despise,To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,And read their hist'ry in a nation's eyesTheir lot forbad: nor circumscrib'd aloneTheir growing virtues, but their crimes confin'd;Forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne,And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,Or heap the shrine of Luxury and PrideWith incense kindled at the Muse's flame.Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife,Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray;Along the cool sequester'd vale of lifeThey kept the noiseless tenor of their way.Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protectSome frail memorial still erected nigh,With uncouth rhimes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd muse,The place of fame and elegy supply:And many a holy text around she strews,That teach the rustic moralist to dye.For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,Left the warm precincts of the chearful day,Nor cast one longing ling'ring look behind?On some fond breast the parting soul relies,Some pious drops the closing eye requires;Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,Ev'n in our Ashes live their wonted Fires.For thee, who mindful of th' unhonour'd DeadDost in these lines their artless tale relate;If chance, by lonely contemplation led,Some kindred Spirit shall inquire thy fate,Haply some hoary-headed Swain may say,'Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn'Brushing with hasty steps the dews away'To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.'There at the foot of yonder nodding beech'That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,'His listless length at noontide wou'd he stretch,'And pore upon the brook that babbles by.'Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,'Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he wou'd rove,'Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,'Or craz'd with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.'One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,'Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree;'Another came; nor yet beside the rill,'Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he,'The next with dirges due in sad array'Slow thro' the church-way path we saw him born.'Approach and read (for thou can'st read) the lay,'Grav'd on the stone beneath you aged thorn.The EPITAPH.HERE rests his head upon the lap of EarthA Youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown,Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,Heav'n did a recompence as largely send:He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.No farther seek his merits to disclose,Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,(There they alike in trembling hope repose)The bosom of his Father and his God.C.
