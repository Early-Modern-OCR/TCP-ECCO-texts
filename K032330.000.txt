THE Perjur'd Husband: OR, THE Adventures of VENICE. A TRAGEDY. As it is Acted at the THEATRE-ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE. BY His MAJESTY's Servants.Written by Mrs. CENTLIVRE.LONDON: Printed for W. FEALES, at Rowe's-Head, over-against St. Clement's Church in the Strand, M.DCC.XXXVII.To His GRACE WRIOTHESLY, DUKE of BEDFORD.May it please your Grace,IT is the just Prerogative of true Greatness to be universally admir'd by all; and one so eminently possess'd of it as your Grace, can no more escape the Tribute of our Praise and Admiration, than you can cease to deserve it: Not that 'tis in the Power of any one, or even the Applause of Multitudes, to reach half your Merit, yet may we be allow'd, according to the Proportion of our poor Stock, to throw in our Mite; and not be frightned from the Hopes of your Grace's Patronage, by considering the Unworthiness of the Offering; for were none but worthy Offerings made, the Gods themselves wou'd lose their Sacrifice; and they that deserve most our Praise shou'd have it least, because 'tis hardest to give them their Due.And 'tis impossible, my Lord, this Poem should find Sanctuary any where but in the Umbrage of your Favour, for the Eyes of all Mankind are so fixt upon your Grace, that 'twou'd be a Disappointment to the Publick. to lay at any other's Door, what is so much your Duee And tho' I hit not a Wildair for the Humour of the

Town in my Play, I may boldly say I have copied the greatest Part of Mankind in the just Admiration of your Grace.Your particular Art, in appearing free, complaisant and conversible, without quitting a Noble Greatness proper to yourself, makes us at once approach you with Freedom and with Awe: Your Goodness, that makes you stoop to your Inferiors, loses nothing by being view'd near at hand, but is the more admir'd for it; and thus we consider your Grace arriv'd at the Height of Greatness, without a mortifying Reflection on the Lowness of our own Condition; nor does the World envy the truly Great, who by their Goodness and Affability make Mankind partake of their Felicity.I may plead Prescription in Excuse of this Presumption, and tell how Poets in all Ages have pretended a Right to lay their Works at some Nobleman's Feet; but I'd rather submit to your Grace's Goodness; for if I have offended, 'tis a Fault of the best kind, and proceeds from too much Zeal to let the World know how much I am,My Lord,Your Grace's most Obedient, and Devoted Humble Servant, Susanna Centlivre.PREFACE.I SHOULD not trouble my Reader with a Preface, if Mr. Collier had taught Manners to Masks, Sense to Beaus, and Good Nature to Criticks, as well as Morality to the Stage; the first are sure to envy what they can't equal, and condemn what they don't understand; the Beaus usually take a greater Liberty with our Sex than they wou'd with their own, because there's no Fear of drawing a Duel upon their Hands; the latter are a Sort of rude splenatick Men, that seldom commend any thing but what they have had a Hand in. These snarling Sparks were pleas'd to carp at one or two Expressions, which are spoken in 'em Aside by one of the inferior Characters in the Drama; and without considering the Reputation of the Persons in whose Mouths the Language is put, condemn it strait for loose and obscure: Now (with Submission to better Judges) I cannot believe that a Prayer-Book shou'd be put into the Hands of a Woman, whose innate Virtue won't secure her Reputation; nor is it reasonable to expect a Person, whose Inclinations are always forming Projects to the Dishonour of her Husband, shou'd deliver her Commands to her Confident in the Words of a Psalm. I heartily wish that those that find fault with the Liberty of my Stile, wou'd be pleas'd to set a Pattern to the Town, by retrenching some of their Debaucheries, for Modesty thrives best by Example. Modest Language from the truly Virtuous is expected; I mean such as will neither act ill, nor suffer ill to be acted: It is not enough that Lucy says she's honest, in having denied the Brutal Part; who ever thinks Virtue centers in that, has a wrong Notion of it; no, Virtue is a tender Plant, which cannot live in tainted Ground; Virtue is what the Air

of Flattery cannot blast, nor the vile sordid Dross of Gain poison; and she that can withstand these two Shocks, may be stil'd truly Virtuous. I ask my Reader's Pardon for my Bluntness, but I hope none of my Sex so qualified will condemn me for exposing the Vices of the seeming ReligiousI fear there are but too many hit by the Character of Signora Pizalta; I wish, for the sake of the reverse Party, there were fewer, or they better known, since the malicious World are so apt to judge of Peoples Inclinations by the Company they keep; which is sometimes authentick, but not always an infallible Rule. I shall say little in Justification of the Play, only desire the Reader to judge impartially, and not condemn it by the Shortness of its Life, since the Season of the Year never promis'd much better Success. It went off with general Applause; and 'tis the Opinion of some of our best Judges, that it only wanted the Addition of good Actors, and a full Town, to have brought me a Sixth Night, there having been worse Plays within this Twelve-month approv'd of.THE PROLOGUE.By a GENTLEMAN.Spoken by Mrs. OLDFIELD.SUCH dreadful Laws of late 'gainst Wit are made,It dares not in the City show its Head.No Place is safe; each Cuckold turns Informer,If we make merry—it must be in a Corner.And here's To-night, what doubly makes it sweet,A private Table, and a Lady's Treat:At her Reflections none can be uneasy,When the kind Creature does her best to please ye.Humbly she sues, and 'tis not for your GloryT'insult a Lady—when she falls before ye.But since no human Wit can stand the Test,With Gorman! and the Champion of the West!She'll fill the Lists, and then you cannot slight her,(With Honour safe) for she's a fair Inviter.Expects no Favour, but at Honour's Call,Defies the boldest Briton of you all;Whate'er's her Fate, she's sure to gain the Field,For Women always conquer, when they yeild.THE EPILOGUE.By Mr. B—.Spoken by Mr. JO. HAINES.TOO long the Poets brought before the Bar,Have with their bold Accuser wag'd the War;They now plead Guilty: And confess the StageHas been immoral, and debauch'd the Age.Nay, they will mend—But wish that in their Station,All Men were pleas'd to forward Reformation.First, let no Politicians, with vain Fears,About suceeeding Kings create new Jars;Let Lawyers now no more perplex the Laws,Nor with malicious Quibbles split a Cause;Let Magistrates consider 'tis but fitting,That as they take down Bills, they'd put down cheating;Let our young Heroes, who would be Commanders,Brag less o'er Coffee, and fight more in Flanders;Let Cheapside Doctors in a frantick Fit,No more make impious War with sacred Wit;Let City Wives (but that's too hard a Task)Mimick no more Town-Ladies in a Mask,Nor from their Prentices the Favour ask;Let no old cast-off Miss assume the Saint,Let Cowards cease to huff, and Beaus to paint;Let at yond Corner House the Wits and Bards,Gain by Religion, what they lose at Cards;Let snarling peevish Criticks cease to bite,Or in a false Sublime dull Plays to write;Let Galleries no more for Judges sit,But leave to the bright Boxes, and the Pit,Their lawful Empire o'er immortal Wit.When all this heavy Task is well perform'd,We dare ingage the Stage shall be reform'd.Dramatis Personae.MEN.Count Bassino, a Savoyard, married to Placentia, and in Love with Aurelia,Mr. Mills.Armando, Bassino's Friend,Mr. Simpson.Alonzo, a Venetian Gentleman, betrothed to Aurelia,Mr. Thomas.Pizalto, a Noble Venetian,Mr. Norris.Ludovico, a Frenchman.Mr. Fairbank.WOMEN.Placentia, Bassino's Wife,Mrs. Kent.Aurelia, a young Venetian Lady, betrothed to Alonzo, but in Love with Bassino,Mrs. Oldfield.Florella, her Woman,Mrs. Baker.Lady Pizalta, Pizalto's Wife,Mrs. Moore.Lucy, her Woman,Mrs. Lucas.Maskers, Dancers, Singers, and Attendants.SCENE, VENICE, in Carnival-Time.

Lucy, I'm undone—That Stranger there has charm'd my Heart: I feelThe Pow'r of conquering Love; quick, quickly tell me,What shall I do to ease this racking Passion?Lucy.Nay, Madam, I fancy your Passion has little Occasion for Lenitives; it blazes so violently at first, 'tis like to be soon extinguish'd.L. Piz.Dear Lucy, don't trifle with me; but contrive, imagine, do any thing, to bless thy Love-sick Mistress with the Sight of that dear Man: And as an Earnest of further Rewards, here, take this— [Gives her a Ring.Lucy.Madam, I receive your Commands with much Joy, but your Present with more— [Aside.] I'll try what this projecting Brain can do, and if you step into the next Room, I'll soon give you an Account of my Proceedings.[Exit L. Pizalta.Bass.Ye Gods!What have I done, that you pursue me thus!Why did you e'er decree that I should wedA Wife I now must hate? Why did I seeThe bright Aurelia?

Oh! my Aurelia![Exeunt omnes, but Lucy & Ludov.Lucy pulling Ludovico by the Sleeve.Lucy.Sir, Sir, one Word with you.Lud.Your Business—Lucy.May one ask you a civil Question, and be resolv'd?Lud.Hum—A civil Question, sayst thou? What's it, prithee, a Night's Lodging? If so, pull off thy Mask, and I'll resolve thee instantly—But I never strike Bargains in the Dark.Lucy.I don't know, Sir, but it may tend to that, by way of Proxy, at the long-run: But at present my Commission reaches no further than to know your Lodgings; if any Thing comes on't, I fancy 'twill not displease you.Lud.(Aside.) Hum—This is but a Pettifogger in Intrigues, I find—Egad, I'm like to be pretty well employ'd during the Carnival—Well, considering I am a Stranger here, this Hit may be a lucky one, and the Lady handsome—Egad, I'll fancy her so at least, wer't but for the Pleasure of Expectation.Lucy.What are you studying, Sir? Are you so long resolving whether you shall accept a Lady's Favour, or no?Lud.No, faith, Child: I am not over-scrupulous in those Matters—Let her be but Woman, and we shan't disagree—And so thou mayst tell her—There's a Direction for thee. [Tears the Superscription of a Letter, and gives it her.[Exit Ludovico.Lucy.Frank and easy, a la mode de Paris—Well, these indifferent Sparks charm more than all your cringing Fops—Now for my Business—Let me see—I'll to my Lady, she'll write; I'll carry the Letter, and the Devil will turn Saint, if I don't bring 'em together, and merit a further RecompenceBy Coupling many have there Fortunes made;I only want Perferment, not my Trade.[Exit Lucy.SCENE II.The Scene changes to Bassino's Lodgings and discovers the Count in his Night-gown, a Table with Lights, and Letters lying on the Table.Bas.All Things lie hush'd in peaceful Silence here:All but Bassino's Mind—Oh! happy heWho lives secure and free from Love's Alarms.But happier far, who, Master of himself,Ranges abroad without that Clog, a Wife.Oh! rigorous Laws impos'd on Free-born Man!On Man, by bounteous Nature first design'dThe Sovereign Lord of all the Universe!Why must his generous Passion thus be starv'd,And be confin'd to one alone?The Woman, whom Heaven sent as a Relief,To ease the Burden of a tedious Life,And be enjoy'd when summon'd by Desire,Is now become the Tyrant of our Fates. [Takes up a Letter.But hold, Bassino! whither does thy PassionHurry thy wandering Reason: Let this LetterRe-call the Fugitive, and fix thy SensesOn dutious Love—A Wife, so young, so fair,So excellent, whose Charms not three Months sinceDid fire thy Soul; a Wife, who dotes on thee;A Wife to whom thou sworest eternal Love—By Heaven, I swear again I will be true.This Thought again restores my Peace of Mind—No, charming Wife; no dear Placentia, no,Thou shalt not beg in vain: I will return. [Kisses the Letter.But who comes here—My Friend Armando?Enter Armando.Arm.Dear Friend, I heardThe Conflict of your Passion, and my JoysAre now compleat, since Virtue gains the Day.Bas.Yes, dear Armando, the Conflict is o'er,And I'm resolv'd to fly to my Placentia.Arm.Cherish that Thought: By Heaven your ResolutionTransports my Soul with Joy!A kind, a virtuous Wife waits your Embraces;A Wife, who like a Turtle mourns the AbsenceOf her dear Mate. Haste then, my Friend, to driveThat Cloud of Sorrow which o'recasts her Mind,And, like the Sun, dispel her gloomy Thoughts.Bas.Thanks for your Counsel—You like a God support my feeble Virtue.This very Morning I'll prepare for Turin,Where Time and Absence will deface the ImageOf that bewitching Beauty, which how hauntsMy tortur'd Mind—Yet, first I'll take my LeaveOf this fair Charmer—And Heaven grantThat I may see her unconcern'd—Arm.My Lord, what d'you mean?Have you well weigh'd the Danger of this Visit?Bas.What Danger can there be?Arm.Danger! my Lord—Consider well how feebleOur Reason is against the Pow'r of Beauty—Bas.My Resolution's firm; no Charm can shake it.Arm.If not her Beauty, fear her Syren Tongue;Fear her endearing Prayers, her fond Reproaches,Her tender Sighs, her Vows, her trickling Tears.Nay—if all these prove vain, fear her Despair,A Woman, an abandon'd Woman's Rage.Bas.Were there more Dangers, yet I'll stand 'em all;My Honour bids me pay this parting Visit:My Heart shall have no Share in what I'll speak.Trust me this once, and be yourself a Witness,Bassino can controul unlawful Love.—Arm.My Lord, 'tis with Regret I see you go,May Heaven assist you in this dangerous Strife.SCENE III.Aurelia's Chamber; She in an Undress with Florella.Aur.No more of that—Cease thy ungrateful Suit,Alonzo is a Man I cannot love;I own he's witty, generous and brave;Has all the Charms that Nature can bestowTo fire a Woman's Heart—Yet I'm insensible,His very Sight chills all my trembling Spirits;Therefore, name him no more—I charge thee do not.Flor.Madam. I've done—Yet shall I be permittedTo ask a Question? Are you then resolvedNe'er to admit a Passion in your Breast?Aur.Oh! Dear Florella, press not a Confession,Which but too well my Eyes themselves disclose.Alas! I love—I love to such Excess,That tho' I know I'm lov'd again, my MindIs still perplex'd with Doubts and jealous Fears.Flor.You love and are belov'd! Then sure you reachThe Height of human Bliss, and bounteous HeavenCan scarce give more—But who's the happy Man;Is it not Count Bassino?Aur.Oh! charming Name; there's Musick in that Sound!Yes, Count Bassino is the Man I love.Canst thou now blame my Coldness to Alonzo?Flor.Forgive me, Madam, if I dare persumeTo speak my Sentiments: I must confessBassino is a Man of excellent Virtue;His Education at the Court of Savoy,Has still refin'd what he receiv'd from Nature;His Person too is charming—And, what most Women court, he has a Title—But then consider, you are unacquaintedWith his Estate, and tho' his EquipageDenotes an ample Fortune, yet we seeMany a Stranger here, during the Carnival,Who makes a Figure by industrious Gaming.As for Alonzo, he was born at Venice,Of Noble Parents; his Estate, a large one—Even from his Youth you had his amorous Wishes,And as he grew in Years his Love encreas'd:You lov'd him too—Nay, which is more, your FatherApprov'd your mutual Loves, and at his DeathBequeath'd you to Alonzo.Aur.Oh! my Florella, thou hast rouz'd a Thought,Which will for every break Aurelia's Rest.I know my Father's Tenderness to meMade him confirm Alonzo's Suit, for thenI lov'd Alonzo—But were my gentle Father still alive,I'm sure he would not cross my Inclinations.But, Oh! name not my Father; I cannot bearThe sad Remembrance of so great a Loss. [Weeps.Flor.But fear you not t'offend his peaceful Ghost,By breaking with the Man he destin'd yours?Aur.'Tis not my Fault: and just Heaven must forgiveWhat Heaven decrees—Yes, 'tis my cruel StarsThat made my Heart inconstant to Alonzo,'Tis with Regret I break my plighted Faith;In vain I strive to check my new-born Love,I cannot, cannot live without Bassino.Flor.Madam, I wish your Passion ne'er prove fatal,But much I fear this inauspicious Match.Enter Bassino, Armando.Aur.May Heaven avert th' unlucky CombinationOf our presaging Thoughts: For, know I tremble too—But here's the Man that will dispel my Fears.Arm. to Bass.My Lord, rememberTo keep your Resolution.Bas. to Arm.Yes—I will keep it— [To Aur.] Madam, you will pardonA Morning Visit, when you know what ReasonsPress'd me to fix it on this early Hour.—By Letters from the Court I was last NightCommanded to return with Speed to Turin,And thence set out for France, to representMy Sovereign Leige in solemn Embassy.This Day I must prepare to take my Journey,Tho' 'tis with killing Grief I leave my dear,My fair Aurelia— [To Arm.] Now, my Armando.Arm.My Lord, 'tis well: But still be on your Guard,The dreadful Shock comes on—Arm.This Day be gone! What means my Lord? Oh! Heaven,My boding Fears are come to pass: I seeA Cloud of Woes just ready to o'erwhelm me.Is't possible! how can that Form divineHarbour such Treachery! Is then Bassino false?Say, perjur'd Man, how often did you swearThis happy Day should make you mine for ever!How can you now forget your solemn Vows?Why have I met with this inhuman Usage?Bas.Madam, my Prince's OrdersAre absolute: My Honour is concern'd.Aur.Must a vain Title be preferr'd to Love?But no—You never lov'd—'twas base Deceit.Curst, curst dissembling Men! Their flattering TonguesCan feign a Passion that will look like Love,Till by Degrees they get us in their Power;Then with bold Impudence they draw the Vizor,And shew the Cheat that mock'd our credulous Hopes.Faithless Bassino,How oft you swore your Love cou'd ne'er expire:How oft you swore one Smile of mine had Charms,Even above the Glories of a Crown.Those were the Oaths I fondly did believe;Those Words convey'd a Poison to my Heart,And even now I feel its mighty Force:My Head turns giddy, and my trembling KneesBetray their sinking Burden—Alas! I faint, I die— [She faints, Bassino runs and embraces heBass.Oh! stay, my Love, my Life, my Soul, my all▪The Conflict's past, and I am thine again.But she is breathless!

He hates Injunctions of Love, like those of Penance: For the one, says he, is no more pleasurable to the Body, than the other beneficial to the Soul.L. Piz.What a fine Gallant I'm like to have with these Principles! Well—what did he say to a Summons from a Woman of my Quality? Did it not make him wish the Time of Assignation were sooner than the Appointment in the Letter?Lucy.He first hum'd over your Billet; and pausing a while, he desir'd me to stay for an Answer in a next Room; then coming to me, he ask'd me what Countrywoman you were? For, said he, if she should prove an old Acquaintance, I would use her damnably—But when I and assur'd him you never saw the Outside of these Walls, he began to have that Desire which all Men have to a new FaceL. Piz.Very well; and what then?Luc.He strait enquir'd whether you were black, brown, fair, old, young, Maid, Wife or Widow? I told him you was a wretched Wise to an old, impotent,

rich, covetous, noble Venetian; beautiful, young, generous, and of a fair Complexion. He hugg'd me at these Words, seem'd transported with the News, and swore that in Intrigues, a Wife was most suitable to his Temper; for, said he, there's neither Children to father, nor Honour to repair: and where his Pocket and Liberty are safe, he is contented to venture his Body and Soul,L. Piz.Excellent Maxims!Lucy.In short, Madam, he says he has had several Bills of this Nature drawn upon him of late, and how much his Stock may be exhausted, he knows not; but however he'll meet you, and if he cannot answer your Expectation, he'll give you Earnest.L. Piz.You talk merrily, Girl; I hope you did not tell my Name. I should be loath to trust a Man of his Character with my Reputation at first Dash.Lucy.No, Madam, I only told your Quality.L. Piz.That's well: Oh! Reputation, what several Sorts of Slavery do we undergo to preserve thee! for to be thought virtuous, we are forced to be constantly railing against Vice, tho' our Tongues and Maxims seldom agree.Lucy.Alas! Madam, that Pretence is grown too common: For the Men now take it for granted, that a Lady is very near surrendring, when once she holds out that Flag of Defiance.L. Piz.Well—Men use us very barbarously: They will neither suffer us to be honest, nor allow us to be thought so—Here, take this Key, and secure every thing that concerns my Reputation: And if my Husband wakes ere I come back, you may easily find some Excuse to prevent his Enquiries; for the Carnival allows us more Liberty, than at other times we dare pretend to—I know thy Honesty, and will rely upon't.Lucy.Yes, indeed, Madam, I am honest at the Bottom.L. Piz.Well, I'll be gone: 'Tis about the Hour[Ex. L. Piz.Enter Pizalto.Lucy.Good Luck attend you, Madam—Oh! Heavens! here's my Lord—Madam, Madam, Madam—Oh! Lord, what shall I say, now she's gone?Piz.Hist, hist, Lucy: Don't, don't, don't call your Lady, for I have a Word or two to say to thee in private, and have waited for this lucky Opportunity a great while—Lucy, aside.Now Venus be prais'd, I hope he has found some Business of his own, that may give my Lady an Opportunity to mind her's.Piz.Well, Lucy, well,—canst thou guess my Business now?Lucy.No, indeed, Sir—But I'm certain, an old Man's Business can't be great. [Aside.Piz.[Gives her a Looking-glass.] Here, Child, this will tell thee—Look in't, look in't, I say—Ah! ah! thou hast a pretty pouting Lip, a delicate roguish Eye; such an Ogle, such a Cast—Ah! Rogue—Faith, thou'rt very pretty: And, in short, if any one rival thy Lady, it will be thee, Lucy—Egad, I have Fire in me yet.Lucy, aside.O' my Conscience, and little too, I believe: Yet I wish he has enough to serve my Ends. I'll make my Fortune—Lord, Sir, what do you mean? I rival my Lady! Heaven forbid; I would not injure so good a Woman for the World—Piz.Pshaw, pshaw—Where's the Injury done to her, Child? Adod, I'll give thee a hundred Crowns.Lucy.No Injury, say you, my Lord? Why, I wonder you should be so jealous of my Lady, and preach such religious Maxims to her, when your own Principles are quite opposite.Piz.Look ye, Child, a Man may do that, which would look abominable in a Wife—A Woman's Reputation is a nice Thing.—Lucy.'Tis so—and therefore 'tis but Reason I should take Care of mine.Piz.Prithee, no more of that: Thy Reputation shall be safe; I'll marry thee to my Gentleman.Lucy.Gentleman—Valet! Faugh—And what Good will a hundred Crowns do me, when my Virginity is gone? Indeed, if you lov'd me as much as you say, and would make my Fortune, (for I should love extreamly to be a Lady) I cannot tell how far you might persuade me—I know my Reputation would be safe in your Hands.Piz.Make thy Fortune! Why, I've known some of our Nobles marry a Wife with less than a hundred Crowns—But adod, thou'rt a charming Girl, and therefore I'll make it a hundred Pistoles—What say'st thou now, Lucy? Ah! adod, I must buss thee; [Kisses her.] Ah! Rogue, methinks I'm a young, lusty, vigorous Fellow again—Thou shall find I am, Girl.Lucy aside.I believe I shall fail you, old Gentleman. Well, my Lord, make it up a thousand Pistoles, and I am your's, else I'll die a Maid, I'm resolv'd.Piz.A thousand Pistoles, why thour't the most unconscionable Wench in Italy: Why, 'tis a Price for a Dutchess in some Countries▪ Come, come, prithee be reasonable, Lucy?Lucy.Reasonable! why you don't ask a reasonable Thing—Look you, you know my Mind, I'll not bate a Penny—I'll warrant my Lady will give me two hundred at least for my Discovery [Going.Piz. aside.Udslife! she won't tell my Wife, sure, m ruin'd if she does; I'd rather give her two thouand—Hold, hold, Lucy, sweet Lucy, prithee ome back—Faith, thou'rt so charming, I can dey thee nothing—Come, it shall be what thou wilt—Come now Rogue, let's retire to thy Chamer—Lucy.Nay, nay, no entring the Premises, till you ave paid the Purchase.—Piz.Adod, thou'rt a Wag—Come in then, and I'll discharge the Debt: Thou art a cunning Gipsy.[Exit Pizal.Lucy.You shall have Reason to say so ere I have done with you, old Gentleman—For I am resolv'd to show you a Trick, and preserve my Virtue. [Aside.For did base Men within my Power fall,T' avenge my injur'd Sex, I'd jilt 'em all.And would but Women follow my Advice,They should be glad at last to pay our Price.[Exit Lucy.SCENE II.The Piazza d' Espagna in Venice.Enter Lady Pizalta sola.L. Piz.Not come yet! ungrateful Man! must aWoman of my Quality wait?How have we lost our Pow'r since the Creation?When the whole World had but one single Lord,Whom every Creature readily obey'd?Yet he, that mighty he, caught with a Smile,Hew to th' Embraces of the tempting Fair.But now each puny Sinner dares to crossA Woman's Inclinations—Enter Ludovico.Oh! are you come, Signior? I suppose you haveSome other Assignation, that made you missMy Hour—Pursue it pray—I'll not interrupt you—Your Servant— [Going▪I hope he'll not take me at my Word. [AsidLud.Nay, nay, Signiora, why this Passion? [Stops heYou sent me a Challenge, and I, like a Man of Courage am come to answer it—Pray don't let a Quarter 
an Hour break Squares—I own it was a Fault to make a Lady wait; but Friends, Madam, Friends, and good Wine are the Devil—Come I'll make you amends.L. Piz.Friends and good Wine! I suppose those Friends were Female ones—Lud.No, Faith: You shall judge of that—But suppose they were—Why should you be angry that I did not fly with the desir'd Haste, as long as I am come time enough to give you Satisfaction—Besides, I han't seen your Face yet, and for aught I know, it mayn't reward my Complement in coming now—Prithee, Child, unmask, and then I'll tell thee more of my Mind.L. Piz.The Devil take this Fellow—and yet methinks I love him for his Indifferency— [Aside.] You talk as if you were unskill'd in the Art of Love: Don't you know that Expectation feeds more than twenty tasted Pleasures?Lud.Hum—some Sort of Fops it may: But I'm none of those—I never give my Opinion of a Dish till I've tasted; neither do I care to dine often on one Sort of Meat without changing the Sauce—But when that Cloud's withdrawn, how long I shall keep my Resolution I know not.L. PizSay you so! Why then the only Way to preserve your Appetite is to feed you slenderly; or only let you see the Food, but not to taste.Lud.Faith, Madam, I'm no Camelion, but Flesh and Blood—Therefore these Prescriptions are of no Use—One Sight of that dear charming Face of your's, would be more obliging to your humble Servant.L. Piz. unmasks.Well, Sir, what think you? Is there any thing in this Face worth your Regard?Lud.Ah! by Heaven, an Angel—Oh! Madam, now blame yourself for my Neglect, for had you sent the Picture of her, in whom all those Beauties center, I had in this Place waited the coming of my Goddess, or rather flown on the Wings of eager Love, to meet my Fair, tho' in the Arms of ten thousand Dangerss—

Say, my charming Angel, do you forgive me? But why do I ask? your Eyes assure me you do; at least I'll force a Pardon from these dear, soft, ruby Lips. [Kisses her in Extasy.L. Piz.Hold, hold! been't so lavish—a sparing Gamester is the likeliest to keep in Stock—whilst a profuse Hand at one Cast throws all he has away.Lud.To fear that, were to doubt your Charms, in which a Lover is sure to find constant Supplies—But we lose Time—Let's retire to my Lodgings, where I'll give thee the best Proofs of my Love I can?L. Piz. aside.Well! He's a charming Fellow—Oh! how happy are Wives in France and England, where such as he swarm!Lud.Come, Madam, come—Why, what do you mean by this Delay? Consider I'm a Man, a mortal, wishing, amorous Man—L. Piz.And consider I'm a Woman—Lud. aside.Ay, ay: That I know: At least I hope to find you such—or I would not be in such Haste—L. Piz.And have a Reputation to preserve.Lud.Oh! Lord, what a damn'd Turn's here? Reputation, say you? Egad, I find all Women make Pretence to that mysterious Word. [Aside.] What! Are not you married, Madam?L. Piz.Yes, what then?Lud.Why then you have a Reputation to preserve—that's all.L. Piz.All, Sir, yes, and all in all to me—Do you consider what Country you're in, Sir?Lud.Yes, Faith, Madam; and what Constitution I am of too. I know Murder is as venial a Sin here, as Adultery is in some Countries; And I am too apprehensive of my mortal Part not to avoid Danger—Therefore, Madam, you have an infallible Security—if I should betray you, I bring myself into Jeopardy, and of all Pleasures, Self-Preservation is the dearest.L. Piz.A very open Speaker, I vow.Lud.Ay, Madam, that's best—Hang your creeping, cringing, whining, sighing, dying, lying Lovers—Pough! Their Flames are not more durable than mine, tho' they make more Noise in the Blaze.Sings:Hang the whining Way of Wooing,Loving was design'd a Sport.L. Piz. aside.The Duce take me if this Fellow has not charm'd me strangely—Well, the Carnival is almost over, and then must I be shut up like a Nun again—Hey! Hoa! This Time will be so short—Lud.Let's make the better Use on't then, my Dear. We will consider when we have nothing else to do, but at present there's a Matter of the greatest Moment, which I must impart to you—Therefore, come dear Rogue, come—L. Piz.[Looking on her Watch.] Hold—I have outstaid my Time, and must return home instantly, to prevent Discoveries.Lud.Faith, Madam, this is not fair—to raise a Man's Expectation, and then disappoint him! Would you be serv'd so yourself now?L. Piz.I'll endeavour to disingage myself from my jealous Husband, and contrive another Meeting.Lud.But will you be sure to meet me again?L. Piz.I give you my Hand as a Pledge—Lud. kisses her.And I this Kiss in Return—Adieu, my Charmer.L. Piz.Signior, farewel.[Exeunt severally.Enter Bassino, Alonzo.Bass.Well, Sir, your Business—Alon.It is to tell you—You are a Villain—Bass.Ha—Alon.And that as suchI ought to have treated you before the FaceOf false Aurelia—But I scorn to followThe barbarous Custom of my native Country,I seek with Honour to revenge my Wrongs;Therefore, Sir, draw—Bass.This Action speaks you noble—be likewise just,And let me know the Cause that moves your Anger.By Heaven I'd rather call you still my Friend,Than be your Enemy—Yet, if I wrong'd you,I'll give you Satisfaction—Alon.Trifler away—Too well thou knowst the Cause;And now wouldst sooth my Wrongs with Flattery.But my Resolve is fixt as Heaven's Decrees:And one of us must fall—Let the SurviverDispose of that base, false, perjur'd Aurelia,As both his Love and Honour shall direct.If my propitious Stars defend my Life,You shall not die alone—Th' adulterous FairShall bear you Company—Now draw.Bass.Oh! hold.One Moment hold, I must unfold this Riddle:Adulterous Fair, say you?Alon.Yes: She's my Wife.Bass.Ha—your Wife!Sure there's a Curse entail'd upon that Name.

Draw, or in my just Revenge,I'll pin you to the Earth—Bass.Oh! Woman! Woman! [Aside.Yes, I will draw—But ere the fatal StrokeIs past Recal, I swear Aurelia's Virtue,Is clear and spotless, like Diana's self:Nor was I prompted on this early Visit,But with Design to take my last Farewel,Having last Night received my Prince's OrdersTo haste to Turin—Therefore if I fall,I hope she'll meet with Mercy—Now come on.Alon.Hold, hold, my Lord; Oh! could I credit this,I would ask Pardon, and entreat your Friendship.Bass.'Tis true, upon my Honour—But if you doubt my Words, I'm ready—Tho' I have Reason to decline this Combat,At least at present—Oh!

Truly you have Reason to say so, for 'tis not the first Intrigue I have manag'd for you—Oh! dear Madam, your Ladyship does me too much Honour—But how do you like your new Servant, Madam?L. Piz.Oh! above all Men living, Lucy: He has the most bewitching Conversation I ever met with—Say, is there no way to contrive a second Meeting? For I'm impatient till I see the dear Man again—The End of the Carnival draws near, which is indeed the End of Life to me: For then must I be coop'd up with Age: Condemn'd to an eternal Coughing, Spitting, Snoring and Ill-nature—Then let me make the best of Life—since Hell cannot have a worse Plague in Store than I have felt already.Luc.Indeed, Madam, I pity you: And with 'twere in my Power to free you from this old, wither'd Log, but tho' that's impossible, yet I may do you some little Services to make Life's tedious Journey pleasant—Let me see, I have it—What would you say now, Madam, if I should contrive a Way to have your Lover in your own Chamber?L. Piz.That were worth a King's Revenue—Speak, quickly, how, how, good Lucy?Luc.Why, thus: He shall put on my Cloaths, and in my Place attend you.L. Piz.Rare Contrivance; but my Husband, Lucy?Luc.Oh! let me alone, Madam, to manage him: He is defective in Sight, you know; and not mistrusting any thing, will not be over curious: But if he should, I

have a way to bring you off—My Life on't—This Plot may be of Use to my Design, I'll manage it with Care. [Aside.L. Piz.Oh! the Pleasure of hearing my Husband lie coughing, and calling me to Bed: And my answering him, I'm coming, Dear; and while he imagines me in the next Room undressing, I'm happy in the Arms of my Ludovico. Certainly there's as much Satisfaction in deceivig a dull jealous Husband, as in getting a new Gallant; Were it not grown so common—each. Tradesman's Wife must have her Gallant too—and sometimes makes a Journey-man of the Apprentice e'er his Indentures be half out—'Tis an unsufferable Fault, that Quality can have no Pleasure above the Vulgar, except it be in paying their Debts. Well, dear Lucy, I admire thy Contrivance—About it instantly—Lucy.(Aside.) About it instantly! is that all? I must have my t'other Fee first.—I will, Madam; and you may expect your Lover instantly. But, Madam, what's to be done with your Brocade Night Gown you tore last Night? it can ne'er be mended handsomely.L. Piz.Nothing to be done without a Bribe I find, in Love as well as Law—Well, Lucy, if you manage this Intrigue with Care and Secresy, the Gown is yours.Enter Page.Page.Madam, my Lord desires so speak with you.Lucy.Madam, I'll go about your Business: Your Ladyship's very humble Servant.[Exit Lucy.L.

Well, you're a pleasant Gentleman—Lud.Ah! my little Female Mercury, what Message bringst Thou? Ha—will thy Lady bless me with another Sight—Ha—How—When? where? I am all in a Flame.Luc.Come along with me, Sir, I'll help you to an Extinguisher presently.Lud.If thou meanest thy Lady, with all my Heart—But I can tell thee, she'll rather prove Oyl, than what you speak of—But, say, where am I to see my lovely Charmer?Lucy.In her Chamber—Lud.Good! But how the Devil can that be done?Lucy.Nay, without the Help of a Conjurer, I assure you; If you dare take me for your Pilot, I'll warrant you Success in your Voyage—I'll set you safe in the Island of Love; 'tis your Business to improve the Soil.Lud.I warrant thee, Girl; do you but bring me there once, and if I play not my Part, may I never more know the Pleasure of an Intrigue.Luc.Which, if I mistake not, is the greatest Curse can fall on you—Well, you must suffer a small Metamorphosis: What think you of personating me a little? That is dressing in my Cloaths, and waiting on your Mistress in her Bed Chamber—Ha—Lud.Egad, I'm afraid I shall make but an awkward Chamber-maid, I'm undisciplin'd in dressing a Lady's Head—Lucy.Oh! Sir, your Commission won't reach so high as the Head: I believe my Lady will excuse little Matters: You can undress, I suppose.Lud.Oh! the best and the quickest of any Man in Venice. But a Pox on't—Canst find no other way?—I, I, I,—I like Petticoats in their proper Places, but I don't care to have my Legs in 'em.Luc.And so you resolve against it? Ha—Lud.No, not absolutely resolve, Child: But—a—Lucy.But what, Sir!Lud.Nothing—I will follow thy Directions, whatever comes on't. Now lead the way: For nothing sutes better with my Humour than a Friend, a Bottle, a new Mistress, and a convenient Place.[Exit. Lucy, Ludovico.SCENE IV.Pizalto's Lodgings.Enter Pizalto with a Bond in his Hand.Piz.Well—My Wife's a fine Woman! a very fine Woman! But a Pox she's a Wife still, and this young Jade runs in my Head plaguly: Well—here 'tis under my Hand; a Thousand Pistoles—A great Sum for a Maidenhead, as Maidenheads go now-a-days—Ah, had I been young now.A Fiddle and a Treat had bore the Prize away,But when we old Fools dote, they make us pay.Enter Lucy.Oh! are you come! Here, here, Lucy: Here's a Fortune for thee, worth Twenty Maidenheads, adod! I have not so much Money by me at present, but there's Security. [Gives her the Bond.Luc.Your Lordship's Bond's sufficient—Well, but that I am satisfied my Reputation is safe with your Lordship, or twice the Sum should not have prevail'd—Go to my Chamber, my Lord, I'll but stop and see if my Lady wants any thing, and I'll be with you instantly.PizYou won't stay, Lucy? Ah Girl, buss thy Lady's Chucky; now do now—Lucy.Oh! Lord! not here, we shall be discovered.Piz.Well, thou art a cunning Sinner: make haste, Lucy, dost hear?[Exit Piz.Lucy.You're in mighty Haste, old Gentleman! but I shall deceive you,My End is gain'd; I have my Fortune made,Man has not me, but I have Man betray'd.The End of the Third Act.ACT IV.SCENE I.Armando's Lodgings.Enter Armando, Placentia.Pla.OH!

But if that fail, I will remove the CauseOf both our Woes—Yes, that happy Charmer,That Rival of my Love shall surely die.Arm.Doubt not of the Success: What Heart of SteelCould ere resist such Beauty drest in Tears?Enter a Servant.Serv.Sir, Count Bassino enquires if you are within.Plac.Oh!
