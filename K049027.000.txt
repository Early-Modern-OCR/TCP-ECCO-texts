Castle—Thunder and Light'ning.Lewis and several Attendants of Lady
Elinor appear in a boat, they land—then Enter Fishermen and
Peasants, male and female different sides, who sing the followingCHORUS.TO Albion's Genius raise the strain,Whose power has aw'd the angry main,And gives us shelter on the coastOf this blest isle; old Ocean's boast.See, retiring o'er the deepDistant lightnings harmless sweep;The storm condemn'd to lose its prey,In hollow murmurs dies away.[Exit Lewis.Fishermen and Peasants Exit on each side, Lady Elinor
and Cicely appear in a boat and land. Lady Elinor plainly dress'd.CicelyNow madam, give me leave to congratu∣late you on your safe
arrival on the English coast.Lady ElinorAh Cicely, if the storm that op∣posed our landing had
fulfilled its threats, it wou'd have reliev'd me from a world of misery.CiceAre you then resolv'd to obey your father and become the
victim of his ambition, by marry∣ing  the young Baron of
Oakland, whom you have never seen?L. EliI am, at least I think I am.CiceO, Madam! how can you determine to for∣get Sir Palamede, he who
loves you so.L. EliPoor Palamede, yet, why was he absent when I left my father's
court? why did he not bid me adieu?—Enter Lewis and Maud.LewMadam, most of your attendants are come ashore, but it's a
great way to Oakland Castle, and its very cold.L. EliWhere are they?LewWhy, Madam, at this good old lady's cot∣tage, where there is a
charming fire, and I wou'd advise you madam, to go there and warm yourself,
for I am sure you must be very cold.[Exit Lady Elinor and Maud.Cice[To Lewis who offers to follow.] Where are you
going sot? Stay here and wait for the rest of Lady Elinor's attendants; and
do you hear, the next voyage you take, I wou'd advise you to keep yourself
sober.[Exit.LewWhy, that's very pretty indeed, so, I am to stay here
freezing by way of a direction post, I got tipsey and lost my money in
France, and began to come to myself, when I was about half seas over; and
now when I thought, I shou'd be comfortable by a good fire, I must remain
freezing here, in all the horrors of sobriety. It is the fate of genius to
make discoveries by which other people profit—why, who have we here?
sure it can't be! yes it is—what my dear Master, Sir Palamede!Enter Lord William.L. WilIs that Lewis?LewYes sir, I was Lewis, till I was froze into an isicle, how
did you come over from Normandy?L, WilIn the same ship with you, though con∣cealed from the
knowledge of Lady Elinor.LewI guess the rest, ah! you are a happy man, you are in love;
I wish I was in love or in liquor, then I shou'd have warmth enough in me
to brave the weather.L. WilI saw your Lady land, whither is she gone?LewWhy, Sir, to a cottage hard by, where is such a delighful
fire-side:—Oh, I wish, I dar'd, follow her.L. WilGo, thither instantly—and say, I in∣treat
permission to fulfil my duty in attending her.LewI'll be there immediately, but may I say I came by your
orders.L. WilYes, begone!— [Exit Lewis.] To what a wayward fate, am I
subjected to love!—without hope and to pursue disappointment.AIR— Lord William.From Hope's fond dream tho' Reason wake,In vain she points with warning hand;I dread advice I cannot take,Love's powerful spells my steps command,The bird, thus fascination binds,When darting from the serpent's eyes,The fatal charm too late he finds,He struggles, and admiring dies.SCENE—The inside of Maud's cottage.Enter Lady Elinor, Cicely and Lewis.L. EliHow Lewis, Sir Palamede in the same ship with us, and coming
here immediately!LewYes Madam, if he is not froze by the way.L. Eli[Aside to Cicely] Oh, Cicely! assist me to
conceal my joy.—What can Sir Palamede  mean by
surprizing me thus?—agreeably—oh! heavens he is here.[Exit Lewis.Enter Lord William.L. WilPardon my intrusion Madam! an hum∣ble dependant on the Lord de
Courcy, may well dread his presumption.L. EliSir, the clandestine manner, in which you quitted my father's
court, renders it impossible for me to consider you as his friend.L. WilOh, forgive me!—long I ador'd you in secret, and
shou'd have fallen a silent sacrifice to my presumptuous love.L. EliWas it well done to take advantage of my father's friendship
for you, and watch an op∣portunity to triumph over the weakness of his
daughter—not that you ever will triumph over her
weakness;—but—but why did you follow me?CiceAh Sir, why did you follow my Lady?L. WilDestiny compelled me hither, compelled me to a land where my
footsteps are forbid∣den, where my presence is a treason, where my life
is proscrib'd!L. EliGood heaven, what have you to fear!L. WilNothing: for I have lost you.L. EliI must not trust myself to pity him—Yet how can I
avoid it, in seeing him unhappy.AIR— Lady Elinor.Tho' pity I can not deny,Ah! what will that avail you?Alas! I dare not hope supply,For hope too sure wou'd fail you.Think when the flatterer shall deceive,In vain you will repent you;Yet should you hope without my leave,is true I can't
prevent you,My hand directed to bestow,In England here I'm landed;And daughters always act, you know,Just as they are commanded.Then let not flattering hope deceive,Or else you will repent you;Yet shou'd you hope without my leave,'Tis true I can't prevent you.[Exit Lady Elinor and CicelyEnter Maud and Martin.MaudSir; I beg your honour's pardon for my boldness, but do you
accompany the Lady, because my Grandson, Martin here, will be your guide to
the Baron of Oakland's Castle.L. WilWhy, do you know the Baron of Oak∣land?MaudAye Sir: I knew him before he was a great man!MarYes Sir, so did I, for all he holds his head so high now,
and quite forgets when he was plain Edmund, the Ploughman.L. WilWhat, d'ye say—why then who is this lord?MaudAh, Sir, it does not become poor folks to speak ill of people
behind their backs, for that it might get to their ears again.MarNo Sir; as my grandmother says, it don't become poor folks to
say.—L, WilPsha, it becomes every one to speak the truth—torment
my curiosity no longer.MaudWhy, then Sir, you must know that about ten years ago, the old
Baron, Lord William, was accused of being in a plot, and conspiring
against the life of our good King William, the Con∣queror, and was
banished.L. WilI remember it.MaudHe took with him his only son, a fine youth, about twelve
years of age; but, alas! Sir, he has not been heard of since.L. WilI am all impatience?MaudNow Sir, about a year ago, Lord William's wicked accuser died,
and declared the good baron innocent.L. WilAlas!MaudThe King willing to make reperation, for the wrongs he had done
him, endeavoured to find him, but all in vain, therefore his lands and
estates have been in possession of a distant relation of the
family;—then sir, there is a young baron the present heir
to.—Enter Cicely.CiceAye and a pretty fellow he is too,—you may go in good
woman, we have no further occa∣sion for you I believe.MaudGood woman—Marry, come up I say, have I lived all
these years to be call'd good wo∣man, by a lady's waiting maid! come along
Martin—a good woman indeed![Exit.MarGood woman indeed![Exit.CiceI have heard the whole story Palemede.L. WilOh, Cicely!—CiceOh Cicely!—ah, you may spare your long speeches, poor
Palamede!—you are in a sad delima truly, and have'nt wit enough to
extricate yourself; but want me to help you, I pity you to be sure, but I
can't help laughing at you.L. WilI have now still stranger motives for wishing to accompany
Lady Elinor to the Castle, motives you cannot guess at.CiceWell, Well! so you shall, leave the man∣agement of the
affair to me, and don't you ap∣pear till we are setting off.L. WilI want words to thank you.CiceI am very glad of it, for words would take up too much of our
time at present, but away and wait till I send for you, 
[Exit Lord William] well wou'd we were at our
journey to Oakland Castle, I wish to see this baron's son,—Dear
Curiosity how I long to—gratify you!AIR— Cicely.Nature to woman still so kind,Among her best boons bestowing;What every female sure must find,A wond'rous desire to be knowing.Man, the proud and envious elf,So jealous of our discerning;Decries in us, what he prides in himself,The wish, for whatever's worth learning.[Exit.SCENE—A Rural prospect—A Cottage.Enter Robert, and Huntsmen,—in the course of the
song, several Huntsmen enter.AIR— Robert and Chorus.Hark! the sweet horn proclaims afar,Against the stag the mimic war;While future heroes' hearts rebound,And pant to hear the trumpet sound.The warlike genius of our isle,Who on the hunter deigns to smile,In echoes gives the chace applause,Which strings the nerve for Glory's cause:Where e'er the devious chace may bend,Still freedom shall our steps attend;And bid us, as her pleasures rise,Defend the blessings which we prize.[Exit Huntsmen.Ed[Without] How are ye my lads?—How are
ye?RobO, here comes our young Master, Lord EdwardEnter Edward.RobDoes your Lordship hunt to day?Edw[Sees Adela at the cottage window, and makes signs to
her.] No, Robert not this morning.RobWhat Sir! do you give up the chace when the game's in view: 
[Points to Adela's window.]EdwHush, that's my dear Adela, whom I told you of; she arrived
here yesterday evening unknown to any body—if you betray the
secret.RobI, Sir! no, no, I am your father's butler, the post of all
others which I love, and while I have the management of the wine cellar, it is
quite indifferent to me how the world wags;—so I shall follow the
Huntsmen.EdwBut hark'ye Robert, not a word about the Haunted Tower, or you
will frighten her out of her wits.RobNo, no, Sir—[Exit.EdwHere comes father, strutting along; ecod he did not strut
so when he followed the plough.Enter Baron and Three Servants.BarHeyday, how dare you appear abroad with∣out your servants with
you, why are you walking alone?EdwWhy father, if one must always move in a crowd, one might as
well be bell-weather, to a flock of sheep.BarSirrah, Sirrah; don't put me in a passion, you have been
civil to those rascals, I know you have, why don't you frown at 'em as I
do? how often have I told you, there's nothing supports dignity like
ill-humour: but you have no ambition.EdwNot much indeed.BarWhy, have'nt you more pride? hey, if you are not proud you dog,
I'll break your bones.EdwWhy, I can't help nature, father.BarNature; why, look at me, do you see any thing like nature
about me? No, no, yet I, myself, am as vulgarly and naturally pleased as
any body; but I'll not show it, I'll defy the best friend I have to say,
I have given him a civil word since I have been Baron of Oakland—an't I
the terror of the neighbourhood.EdwYes, that you are; especially since you imprisoned the
poor fellow for catching a hare—and it is proved since that he is
innocent.BarInnocent, I am very sorry for it—that is—I
shou'd be sorry, if I was not a Baron—give him this money; 
[Gives Edward money] but don't let him know it
comes from me, but tell him I have the power to hang him; for I will have no
man dare to think I am in the wrong; justice holds her seat in my breast,
and is to all parties equal and indifferent.EdwVery indifferent indeed.BarWhat's that you say? if I desired you to behave ill to other
people, I did'nt mean you should to me—do you know who I am? that I am
the Baron of Oakland, and that all dignity flows me.EdwYes, it flows from you pretty fast, I think none seems to
stay with you.BarDon't you grumble Sirrah, but do you hear? prepare to receive
the Lord de Courcy's daughter, whom I intend for your wife, I expect her
arrival every day.EdwBut perhaps I may not like her, father.BarThat may be, but you shall marry her for all that, I
insist on it, aye; and love her too—no,—I don't know that I may
insist upon that.SerHa! ha! ha!BarWhy, you impudent scoundrels, how dare you laugh so! I'll
have no persons to attend upon me that have'nt a proper respect for my
dignity—follow me you rascals—[Exit with servants.EdwI hope I shall be too sharp for you, tho' father, for I am
determined to marry nobody but Adela, 
[knocks at the cottage door and retires, after calling,
Adela! Adela!]Enter Adela from the cottage
looks surprized at not seeing Edward!AIR— Adela.Whither my love! ah! whither art thou gone!Let not thy absence cloud this happy dawn.Say—by thy heart, can falsehood e'er be known?Ah! no, no, I judge it by my own.The heart he gave with so much care,Which treasur'd in my breast I wear;Still for its master beats alone,I'm sure the selfish thing's his own.[Edward appears after the song.]AdelaOh, my dear Edward! I am glad you are here, I have got a
thousand questions to ask you—is the Lady Elinor de Courcy arrived
yet?EdwShe is not, so all you have to do is, to dress yourself in
the cloaths I gave you, and to pass upon father for her.AdelaEgad, and so I will—I always long'd to be a fine lady,
but how shall I manage to be∣have like one?EdwFaith, I can't tell you—however, it don't signify, any
thing will pass upon father.AdelaBut are you sure now Edward, he has not much dignity, if he
has, I shall only be confounded and look foolish; but is he much like a
great gen∣tleman?EdwHa, ha, ha! heav'n bless you, father is no more like a
gentleman than I am—AdelaI am glad of it, for the presence of our great quality folks
always takes my breath away, and tho' I cough and hem, for an hour, the deuce a
word can I get out.Edw'Tis just the same with me—tho' I am a Baron's son,
for my part, I never feel myself so  much like a great
man, as when I am with the servants—I hate talking to my betters.AdelaI am pleased to hear you say so, I was afraid you would
have forgot poor Adela, for the rich lady, de Courcy.EdwWhat marry a woman of quality—oh! I shall be a lost
man; I shou'd never be able to make free with her—shou'd she use
me ever so ill, I cou'd never venture to scold her.AdelaBut when you marry me—EdwOh! I love you so much, that I cou'd scold you with the
greatest satisfaction.AdelaBut won't marriage—EdwNever fear Adela, love has hitherto been our constant
attendants—I'll warrant you he'll follow us to church.AdelaAy, but they say, he has a sad knack of leaving married
couples at the church door.EdwPsha, love and marriage are better friends then you think
for.AdelaYes, perhaps they are best friends at a distance.EdwNo, no, like true friends, love and mar∣riage must meet
together, to perfect the happiness of both—Oh! Adela, when I come to
the title and estate, and you are my lady.AdelaOh, we shall be as happy as the day is long.EdwAye, and the night into the bargain.AdelaThen such dancing—EdwAnd such tilting and cudgel playing.AdelaAnd such fine talking and singing—EdwAnd then such eating and drinking.AdelaAnd such fine company, and then.—DUET— Adela.Will great lords and ladies,Drest up on gay days,Come to visit you and I?Edward.All smiling, bowing,Great friendship vowing,While we hold our heads so high.Adela.But shou'd the fine gentry smoke us,Lud! how they'll joke us;How they'll laugh at silly me.Edward.Pshaw, we shall be everReckon'd vastly clever,While our pocket's full, d'ye see.Adela.Then every dayEdward.New joy shall bring,Adela.And ever gayEdward.We'll dance and sing.Both.Fall lall de rall,How merry shall we be.Adela.Of great fortune vaunting,Low people taunting,Dignity we must support.Edward.'Mong high barons bouncing,Fine ladies flouncing,We may chance to go to court,Adela.Well, fegs, I care not,Court, tho' we share not,If at home we happy be.Edward,Soon I may be boldTo hope that I shall holdA little baron on my knee.Adela.Then every dayEdward.New joy shall bring,Adela.And ever gayEdward.We'll dance and sing.Both,Fall lall de rall,How merry shall we be.[Exit Edward and Adela.SCENE—A Field.Enter De Courcy and Attendants.De CourHere let us remain, till I gain some intelligence of the
object of our search, I am sure my sister and her attendants must
have been on board that very ship, which we saw at a distance in the late
storm.Enter Charles.De CourWell Charles! what news of my sister?CharlesMy lord, I learn that the lady de Courcy is on her road to the
Baron of Oakland's Castle, which is at no great distance.De CourAnd Sir Palamede—CharlesMy lord, I am sorry to say he is with her.De CourInfamy, and dishonour! but I will pursue her, and avenge the
wrongs of my family; go forward Charles, and procure every intelligence you can
gain—I shall wait for you within a mile of the Baron's Castle.[Exit De Courcy and Attendants.CharlesI will, because it is my duty; but wou'd I were in Normandy
again, nothing shou'd induce me to quit it, except my regard for so good a
master.AIR— Charles.My native land I bade adieu,And calmly Friendship's joys resign'd;But ah! how keen my sorrows grew,When my love I left behind.Yet should her truth feel no decay,Should absence prove my charmer kind,Then shall I not lament the day,When my love I left behind.[Exit.SCENE—The inside of Maud's Cottage.Enter Lord William, Lady Elinor, and
Cicely.L. EliWell! Palamede, I will frankly own to you, that the account, I
hear of the Baron of Oakland's son, is far from pleasing me; and though I
dare not disobey my father, yet I will do every thing in my power to delay
the marriage—CiceIn short, Si,r my lady agrees to my scheme of visiting the
castle as Lady Elinor's Attendant till she hars further from the Baron, her father.L. WilTransporting tidings!TRIO— Lord William, Cicely and Lady Elinor.Against the shaft of cruel fate,Why cannot virtue prove a charm,And of her blind misguided hate,Capricious Destiny disarm?Yet who engag'd in Virtue's cause,To tread her paths wou'd fear confess,And on the road reluctant pause,Because it leads not to success.[Exit.END OF ACT FIRST.ACT II.SCENE—An Apartment in the Castle.Enter Hugo and Robert.HugoWell Robert!RobMake yourself perfectly easy, friend Hugo, every thing
shall be in perfect order to receive Lady Elinor.HugoAye, I hope so, for the honour of the family; It is near three
score years since I was first a servant in Oakland Castle, and have
seen three possessions of it; I have come down from father to son,
with the rest of the old furniture.RobAnd a fine tough piece of English Oak you are.HugoI remember the death of Edmund Ironside and the restoration
of Canute; I remember the Harolds and Hardy Canute, and the good King Edward
the Confessor; and I remember the good Baron, who now haunts the old
Tower.RobHush! no more of that.HugoAh Robert, if you were old enough to remember what I can.RobI am just as well pleased as it is.HugoWe shall have musick and dancing enough at the wedding, I
hope Robert—for the honor of Lord Edward.RobYes, yes, when a man is desperate to at∣tack matrimony, the
more noise and bustle the better; like trumpets in a battle, it drowns
reflec∣tion and prevents cowardice.HugoAre all the pikes and javelins burnished up, and the armoury
put in order, and the large stag's horns in the hall dusted?RobHorns are most ominous wedding deco∣rations—No, no,
friend Hugo, I have ordered the horns to be taken down.HugoBless my soul! why, I remember 'em in the family these
fifty years.RobFor which reason, the young lady ought not to see them.HugoThen is the Lady Elinor very beauteous Robert?RobWhy do you ask Hugo, do you admire beauty yet?HugoOh yes, Robert! I never could yet behold a beauteous woman
without admiration; the setting sun may surely cheer my sight tho' it
cannot warm my heart.[Exit.RobI hope Adela has got her fine cloaths on, to pass for Lady
Elinor—O! here she comes!Enter Adela, elegantly dress'd from a door in the
back scene.AdelaWell, here I am at last ready dress'd, to pass for a fine
lady; but how long shall I remain so?RobWhy, you are now in the high road to suc∣cess.AdelaAye: but there is so many turnings and windings that one is
never sure of being right,RobWhat! Madam with such a guide as Merit.AdelaYes, Merit is often apt to lead one a stray;—Oh dear! I
do think the old Baron is coming—hey, O no! he is'nt—O! I wish
the meeting was over.RobYou have no idea, how much you look like a woman of
quality!—AdelaIndeed?RobNature certainly intended you for a fine Lady.AdelaThen indeed shew as very much mistaken; for I never in all
my life cou'd tell a lie, without blushing; so I am sure I shall never
do for a fine lady.RobBut I hope you have your lesson by heart.AdelaO ay, let me see, I am come over from Normandy, from my
friends, and arrived here to day, did'nt I, Sir?RobYou did ma'am.AdelaAnd anxious to pay my respects to the Baron of Oakland, left
my servants on the road?RobYes ma'am.AdelaO! but there's one material circumstance I have forgot, I
don't know who my father is.RobThat may happen in the best regulated families; however, I'll
tell you—your father is the Baron de Courcy of Normandy, a great favorite
of our good King William, and you will remember, that the King wrote to your
father, recommending this marriage.AdelaWell, I'll endeavour to recollect if I can, but you know it is
not very strange, I shou'd for∣get what never happened.RobWell madam! I will go and acquaint my lady of your
arrival—and pray be careful in what you say.AdelaYou may depend on it Sir, I'll not speak truth if I can
possibly help it. 
 [Exit Robert.] These gay trappings hang very
much in my way, I shall make a sad fine lady I fear; I wish I cou'd 
 fancy myself in my every day cloaths again, when I think
where I am and on what occasion, I won∣der at my own confidence! Nothing but
love cou'd have inspired it, and to gain my dear Edward, I wou'd attempt a
thousand times as much!AIR— Adela.Be mine, tender passion, soother of care,Life's choicest blessing, shield from despair;Do not deceive me, ah! never leave me,Still may my bosom thy power declare.In vain thy influence fools may revile,Constancy ever gains thy smile.And of their destiny can those complain;Whose falsehood dares thy laws profane?Resolv'd I brave all danger, to every fear a
stran∣ger;Thy sweet rewards, oh, Love to gain.Then let me combat not in vain;But in my triumph share,Thy smiles, for which I bravely dare.O! here he comes, ah! its all over—I shall never be able
to get thro':Enter Baron and Robert.BarAh! there she is sure enough—she seems very
pretty, what a fine eye she has. 
[Aside to Robert.]AdelaMy courage fails me—'twill never do I find!— Aside,]BarHer coming so suddenly is so cursed un∣lucky, I don't
know what to say to her, I have not got my speech in my pocket; she turns
her back upon me. I believe she is very proud— [Aside to Robert.]AdelaAy, now he is laughing at my aukward∣ness—I wish
hed speak first, 
[Aside.]BarWell, come if I must speak, here goes—My lady, the
joy!—I say my lady the joy!—that is joy my lady creates
happiness—and is—is—joy my lady—which joy I say my
lady is—I hope your Ladyship is pretty well.AdelaYes, pure well, I humbly thank your lordship—O lord! I
am glad it's over, the first word is a great matter, 
[Aside.]BarShe's wonderous, condescending, Robert, considering her high
blood, 
[Aside to Robert,]—Well my lady, as you
have been in such a hurry as to leave your servants on the road, and only
to come here on a hop, as a body may say; I hope your ladyship will have
the goodness, to excuse all faults.AdelaO yes, my lord, I'll excuse all your faults with a good deal
of pleasure.BarAll my faults, aye, she has found me out already, 
[Aside.]—Why to be sure my lady, we all
have faults; but if one is of a good family, you know my lady, it does'nt so
much signify.AdelaO! to be sure not, for though some peo∣ple are a little
aukward and bashful before company, yet I don't think they are a bit the
worse for that.BarNo, no—that's a hit at me— [Aside.]AdelaFor you know my lord, if one is not used to strange company,
one's very apt to look like a fool—BarYe—e—s so one is my lady—yes she means me,

[Aside,] but come my lady, let's talk of
something else; how does the lord, your father, I respect a man of his
great family.AdelaAy my lord, a great family indeed?BarOh, she's proud enough of her high blood, tho', 
[Aside] well my lady! no offence, but I fancy I
may venture to say, my family is equal to his!AdelaWhy, I thought Edward told me, he was his only child, 
[Aside] indeed my lord!BarAye, indeed my lady;—now my blood is up, I can talk to
her, 
[Aside] and give me leave to assure your
ladyship, whatever notions you have form'd of a great family, you'll not be
disap∣pointed.AdelaHa! ha! ha!BarHa! ha! ha! 
[mimicks her aside,] What the devil does she
mean?AdelaI declare your lordship makes me laugh, ha! ha! ha!BarYes I see I do, but I think your ladyship need not be so
polite as to tell me so.AdelaNay, now your lordship looks angry.BarHave'nt I reason! what did your ladyship mean by affronting
me, in telling me of your fathers great family!AdelaWhy so he has, there are eleven of us, boys and girls.Bar[Surprized] Hey, what?Adela[Aside] O what have I said!Bar[Aside] O! I suppose this is some quality
joke, and that's the reason I don't understand it.Enter Edward.BarCome here sirrah, there's the Lady Elinor de Courcy! go and
talk to her, bid her welcome; and do you hear, don't be bashful, and
dishonour your family; but attack her with your whole stock of
impudence.Edw bashful! no I
thank you, we people of fashion know what's what. 
[Dancing up to Adela.] Tol. de roll.
am prodigiously happy to see
your ladyship;—hope you left all friends in Normandy well, all right
and tight, had good weather, and a good ship, no sea sickness; even we
people of fashi∣on are subject to it sometimes, as well, as well as other
people—an't we father—hey!BarWhy, the boy's assurance astonishes me—oh! he has
touch'd her hand and caught it of her.Adela[Whispers to Edward.]Edw[Aside to Adela,] Never mind I'll bring you off
with the old fellow—ha! ha! ha! a monstrous good joke indeed, very well
faith, very well, ha! ha! ha!AdelaHa! ha! ha!Bar[Looks surprized and then laughs heartily.] Ha!
ha! ha!EdwMy dear father: Lady Elinor tells me she has joked a little
with you, as we people o fashion do without meaning any thing—ha! ha!
ha!BarAye we people of fashion do, ha! ha! ha! I beg your ladyship
woud'nt think of it.EdwZounds, father don't be bashful— [To Adela.] why don't you bounce a little as I
do.BarWell my lady, I am now going to my great hall, where I'll
receive you in form, and I believe I shall trouble your ladyship with a bit
of a speech on the occasion, come my lady—no, no, you must not go
before me—I am a baron you know, consider my dignity![Exit.EdwI say Robert, I think we shall be too cunning for old
dignity, though:[Exit.SCENE—A view near the Castle.Enter Lord William and Lady Elinor.L. WilWe are at length arrived at Oakland Castle, continue your
disguise madam, but a little longer.L. EliAnd do you Palamede, recommend dis∣guise, you who pretend to
be a lover?AIR— Lady Elinor.Hush, hush; such counsels do not give,A lover's name profaning;And can her heart deceit advise,Where mighty love is reigning?Dissimulation's path you've trodToo oft to go astray,And whilst to me, you point the road,Your footsteps mark the way.Enter Cicely.CiceOh! madam here comes the old Baron, but pray think of
something melancholy, or you will certainly laugh; nature and art have made
him such a strange animal, that he seems only to be laugh'd at; but here
he is!L. WilAnd is this the representation of our family, degrading
thought! but I must dissemble 
[Aside.]Enter the Baron.Bar[To Cicely] So you are an attendant on lady Elinor
de Courcy, hey! but who's that 
[pointing to Lady Elinor.]CiceOh! that's my lady's own waiting woman, and a very great
favourite of my lady's Sir,—I assure you.BarShe must be a great favorite of every body's for she's a
monstrous pretty girl; and pray who is that gentleman, is he a favorite of
your ladyship's? 
[pointing to Lord William.]CiceO no! that is—that is Sir Palamede the Baron's
Jester.L. WilA curious character she has assigned me, but I must
carry it on, 
[Aside]BarWhy, jesting is a very pleasant employment to be sure,
though not a very profitable one.—I  shou'd
think—hark'ye friend, don't you some∣times get a bone crack'd?L. WilYou are mistaken, my lord, we jesters are privileged people;
we anatomize vice and folly.BarAy, that is you cut up people by way of amusement.L. WilImprovement my lord—satire well applied, is the medicine
of the mind—BarThat may be, but I don't take physic, so you may spare
your trouble; and so the baron pays you for jesting, hey? that's one way of
enjoying a jest, at his own expence; but I shoud think now, so good-natured as the
world is, that he might contrive to get laugh'd at, Gratis.L. WilYour lordship finds it so, I have no doubt, now as a
specimen.AIR— Lord William.Tho' time has from your lordship's faceMade free to steal each youthful grace,Yet why should you despair?Old busts oft please the connoisseurs,So folks of taste, perhaps like yours,And that removes your care.'Tis true that silly girls believeIn joys that youth alone can give,But why shou'd you despair?'Tis folly governs youth, you know,And so far young you soon may grow,So that removes your care.Whate'er your faults, in person, mind,(However gross) you chance to find,Yet why should you despair?Of flattery you must buy advice,You're rich enough to pay the price,So that removes your care.BarAh! that's another hit at me, but, I dare not resent it, 
[Aside] well, but if you are attendants on the
lady Elinor de Courcy, where have you been all this while?CiceOh! Sir, we have left my lady behind on the road.BarYour lady has left you behind you mean—why she's here in
the castle.—L. WilIndeed!BarYes, indeed, Mr. Jest-hunter, and, I am going to give her
ladyship audience in my Great Hall—and if we want any body to laugh
at—we'll send for you—there, I hit him I think.[Exit.L. EliWhat can he mean—give me your ad∣vice, Palamede.CiceAh, madam! you forgot that Sir Palamede is a lover, and
consequently advice is a commodity he does'nt deal in; but if you will take
my opinion, ma'am?L. WilWell?CiceIt is plain some imposter has assumed your ladyship's
name, for what purpose we must endea∣vour to find out; therefore
suppose we continue our disguise, wait on the mock lady Elinor,
overturn her with respect and confound her with courtesy—L. WilAdmirable!—Enter Lewis with letters, which he delivers to
Lord William.LewSir, the messenger is return'd and brought these
letters—Aye, madam, your shadow is here before you, find—L. EliHush! not a word, I charge you; from whom are those letters?

[Aside to Lewis.]LewThat's what I want to know, I wish you wou'd ask Sir
Palamede, the question?L. WilLady Elinor, every moment furnishes additiona reasons for requesting you will be
guided by Cicely's advice.[Exit with Lady Elinor.LewAh! Cicely, there they go, a pair of as true turtles as ever
bill'd—Oh! what a fine thing mutual love is if you wou'd but let us
follow their example, and fall in love with me in a strange place,
now!—CiceOh! you may spare your rhetoric—I promise you. I prize
my liberty too much to be talk'd out of it.AIR— Cicely.What blest hours, untainted by sorrow,Does the maiden prove,Who knows not love,So merri'y she sings thro' the day;"Dull sorrow shall threaten in vain,"The delight of heart to restrain,While from Cupid free,Blest in Liberty,"Not a sigh she blends with the strain."As she gaily carols along,Let me join sweet Freedom's song,O! may my heartEver bear a part,In the envied jocund lay,While merry the happy maid,So blithely sings thro' the day.[Exit.SCENE—An Apartment in the Castle.Enter Edward.EdwWhere the duece is Adela? if we can but get married before she
is discovered—but, why is she absent? she for whose sake
Oakland Castle resounds with jollity, till the old walls crack to their
foundations.AIR— Edward.Now all in preparation,For the nuptial celebration,Each maiden on th' occasion,Feels her heart in palpitation;Now a blush, and now a sigh,Trembling too, she knows not why,While every lad with expectation,Finds his heart beats high.Enter Adela hastily.AdelaAh! it's all over, there's an end of our scheme.EdwHow!AdelaI knew how it wou'd happen.EdwDid you, I wish then you had told me so before!AdelaWell, it's all a scheme of your own.EdwMine! why you know it was your scheme.AdelaWhy did'nt you first propose it?EdwYes, because I was sure you first thought of it.AdelaWhy, did I ever leave my spinning wheel for fine cloaths? why
did I quit my father's cottage.!EdwBecause I got you a better situation to be sure—you
won't deny that I sent you to a relati∣on's house in Suffex, six months
ago, where you liv'd like a lady, and had nothing to learn, to read all the day
along.AdelaSo much the worse, improving the mind as they call it, only
serves to make one lazy; in my father's cottage, industry took up all our
time, Wealth never came near our door.EdwIf he had, you wou'd have been glad to have ask'd him in.AdelaNo Sir! there Innocence, and Happi∣ness were our guests.Edw'Twas lucky they did'nt take up much room, or the house
woud'nt have been big enough to hold 'em—I fancy all the spare corners
were occupied by birds and beasts.AdelaWell, I own it! we did all sleep under one roof; the family,
the pigs, and poultry all in harmony, peace and friendship.EdwExcept now and then, when you ate some of your company for
dinner.Adela[Sobbing] Oh! oh!EdwWhy look'ee there, now that's always your way, if one says any
thing to you—you fall a crying!—AdelaYou want to break my heart!—I see that.EdwNo, I dont—AdelaYes, you do—Enter Robert.RobWhy, what signifies quarrelling now my lord.EdwWhy, I don't know Robert, she will quar∣rel I think.AdelaNo, it is you—RobCome be friends I say, we are all in a pret∣ty hoble to be
sure.AdelaYes, and I believe you brought us into it.Edw'Tis my opinion he did—RobMe!AdelaYes, I am sure, Edward woud'nt have thought of such a thing,
if you had'nt put it into his head.EdwNo, that I shoud'nt—RobYou are both very entertaining and so I shall leave you to
yourselves.EdwNay, but Robert, don't desert us.RobFaith I shall make my peace with your father, by falling on my
knees, and asking pardon immediately.AdelaHad'nt we better do the same, Edward? for consider we are
all in the same boat, and if we pull different ways, we shall certainly go
to the bottom.EdwThat is very true,—so Robert you shall be our
pilot.RobWell! then we must 'een meet the old baron in the hall of
audience, at any rate; [how won∣derfully does common interest beget
friendship!][Exit.EdwAdela—AdelaWell—EdwYou forget we have been quarrelling, kiss and friends, you
know— [kiss and exeunt.]AIR— Edward.While swords and shields are clashing,Archers aiming, cudgels thrashing,The ale to none denying,Flaggons far and wide supplying,With tilters fencing, wrestlers boasting.Bonfires blazing, oxen roasting;And all the vassals flock around,What pleasures now abound!Now all in preparation,For the nuptial celebration.SCENE—An Antique Hall, a State Chair on seve∣ral
People discover'd, Tenants, Servants, &c.Enter Lord William, Lady Elinor, Cicely, Lewis, Martin and
Charles.CiceWell Charles, how did you come over from Normandy?CharlesWhy, Cupid lent me his wings and I hovered over your
ship—come, come, Cicely you know as well as I, there were more lovers
aboard than the Captain knew of—CiceI believe I had better ask no more ques∣tions.L. WilLewis, come hither, you are sure that not a whisper has
escaped you; likely to discover Lady Elinor.LewLord, Sir! I have done nothing but ate and drink since I have
been here, so that I have no time for talking.L. WilAnd our honest guide here: 
[pointin got Martin.]LewOh! no, Sir, he has been so taken up between hunger and
wonder—that he has not thought of secrets.L. EliYou are certain the servants know what to do Cicely?CiceO yes, madam, I have given them all their lessons, and
you'll see them receive the mock Lady Elinor, as you cou'd wish, but see,
she comes!—Enter Adela, Edward, and Robert.CiceNow, ma'am, to compleat their astonish∣ment!SESTETTO.Lord William, Cicely, and Lady Elinor.By mutual love delighted,Here Fortune's fav'rites see,In Hymen's bonds united,How happy must they be.Adela.Whom can they mean?—not me.Edward.Nor me.Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for me.Charles.What grace!—what an air!Lord William.A face so fair.Cicely and Charles.Born to command the happy pair.Lord William, Cicely, and Lady Elinor.By mutual love delighted,Here Fortune's fav'rites see, &c.In Hymen's bonds united,How happy must they be.Edward.Egad the joke we'll humour;Adela.With all my heart, say I.Edward.Who for success can do more,Than every chance to try,Charles.Her courage faulters—mark her eyes;See from her cheek the colour flies.Cicely.Poor girl—I pity her distress,Yet Mischief says we can't do less.Robert to Adela.You tremble—courage—come, go on,Adela.Ah me! my boasted spirit's gone;Alas! why didst thou, hapless maid,By silly vanity betray'd,Expose thy peace of mind to gainA prize, thou never canst obtain?Enter Baron,—Struts to the Chair, sits down
with great ceremony, then rises, and speaks; his hat in his hand with the
speech in it—which he occasionally looks at.BarHem! my Lady Elinor de Courcy—now some men in my
situation, wou'd make you a set speech on the occasion; but I shall
give your lady∣ship a touch off hand; as to your great family, my lady, all
the world knows that—and as to your beauty—why that speaks for
itself, as a body may say;—but I say, when I consider, my
lady—I say—when I consider how vain it wou'd be to number your
numberless qualifications, and when I think of your goodness,
in—confering this visit—I want words— [Edward takes the speech slily out of his father's
hat:] I say, my Lady Elinor, I want words to— [misses the speech.] Hey! egad, I do want
words!—I say—madam—my lady∣ship I,—I,—I, want
words!—EdwIf my father had not wanted words madam, he would have attempted
to express, his inexpressi∣ble satisfaction—but 'tis just as
well as it is—the less that's said, the more there is to guess
at.Enter Servant.SerMy Lord! a gentleman wishes to speak with you
immediately.BarI come to him. 
[Exit servant.] I declare my lady! I am quite
asham'd that I—.AdelaO, pray my lord make no apologies!—you know you want
words, and it is quite time to have done, when one has'nt any more to
say—BarAye, my lady, but I had a great deal more to say—if I
had'nt lost my speech— [aside and exit.]Adela[To Edward] I can't make out the mean∣ing of all
this, I don't understand the jest!—EdwNor I, upon my soul—but I'll try to find it out, for my
part I think we are in a dream.AdelaI am sure it is a very pleasant one, I have'nt the least
desire to be wak'd from it.[They Sing part of the last Air again,
and exeunt, Lord William, Lady Elinor, Cicely, Lewis, Charles, Edward, Adel.,
and Robert.]Lord William, Cicely, Lady Elinor, Charles, and
Robert.Alas! behold the silly maid,By pride by vanity betray'd:Expose her peace of mind to gainA prize she never can obtain.SCENE—A Room in the Castle.Enter Baron and De Courcy.BarThis way my lord, this way, I am glad to see your
lordship—De CourHush, my lord! remember that I am here in disguise; I
must depend on your friendship, to conceal me from my sister's
attendants, till I am revenged on Sir Palamede—BarAnd so this Palamede—De CourHe has long privately lov'd my sister, but the mean
advantage he has now taken of our confidence in him—BarO! hang him, an abusive sneering knave, to pass on me for
your lordship's jester; I wish I had known this—De CourBut we must be cautious— [Laughing within.] dark! what noise is that?BarOnly my vassals carousing, in consequence of this
marriage of your sister's in our family.De CourThe sounds of festivity, but ill accord with my feelings; a
more retired apartment might suit our purpose better.BarCertainly, my lord, private concerns, must give way to public
justice.[Exit.SCENE—The Kitchen, Tenants and Servants, dis∣covered
at different tables—at the upper end an Ox, roasting, Cooks, &c.
basting it.Robert comes forward and sings.AIR— Robert.Now mighty roast beef is the Englishman's food,It ennobies our veins, and
 our blood,Our soldiers are brave, and our
ons are good.Oh! the roast beef of Old England, and Old En∣glish
roast beef.Our barons, my boys, are robust, stout and strong,And keep open house with good cheer all day long,Which makes their plump tenants rejoice in this song,Oh! the roast beef, &c.Enter Lord William, Lady Elinor, and
Cicely.RobCome, my lads and lasses, at this feast every one must
contribute to the common stock of merri∣ment, that is the only reckoning we
have to pay.FINALE.Lady Elinor, and Cicely.Love's sweet voice to Hymen speakingBreathing thro' the dulcet flute;Listning joy
the accents seeking,Bids complaining Care be mute.CHORUS.High above dull Sorrow's level,Now the tide of joy display;Love and Hymen bid us revel,Bid us hail this happy day.Lord William.Let the vine's enlivening treasureRising kiss the goblet's brim,Till we see exulting pleasure,On the smiling surface swim.CHORUS.High above dull Sorrow's level,Now the generous tide display;'Tis gay Bacchus bid us revel,Bids us hail this happy day.Cicely.While the merry bells resounding,Shall in pleasure's chorus chime,From the trembling floor rebounding,Let the varied dance beat time.CHORUS.High above dull Sorrow's level,Now the tide of joy display,Love and Hymen bid us revel,Bid us hail this happy day.END OF ACT SECOND.ACT III.SCENE—A Room in the Castle.Enter De Courcy and Charles.De Courcy,YOU are sure that the soldiers are plac'd at every avenue to
the Castle?CharMy lord, it is impossible Sir Palamede shou'd
escape!De CourAnd you say, you observ'd him this evening?CharI did, my lord, and notwistanding he ap∣pear'd to join the
general festivity; yet at times he sigh'd so piteously, that I cou'd
not help saying to myself, your honour cou'd never find in your heart to
kill so brave a gentleman.De CourLeave me and be ready at the time ap∣pointed—and shall
this slave boast a virtue to which I am a stranger—shall his
rugged heart feel compassion for wretched, whilst I unmoved doom to
destruction, him! who has been my Com∣panion!—my Friend!—my
Brother!— [Aside,] Poor Palamede, I will see him and
converse with him—perhaps he is not so guilty as he appears—at
least let me remember that he is unfortunate![Exit.CharThere spoke the generous feelings of de Courcy.AIR— Charles.Where'er true valour can its power display,There meek-ey'd Pity, anxious still to bless,With jealous honour holds divided sway,And from avenging anger shields distress.Ne'er shall the sword of Honour dare
invadeThe spell bound spot, where Pity drops a tear;For where Misfortune casts her sacred shade,There deepest injury must disappear,Enter De Courcy and Baron.BarO, my lord de Courcy, I am glad I have found you, I have
strange news to tell you: only think my lord, when I thought my vassals
had re∣tired fatigued, and gone dutifully drunk to bed, the whole village is up
and scouring their old hel∣mets and armour; I am sure there's mischief in
the wind when these rascals are so industrious.De CourCompose yourself my lord, you seem quite
alarm'd!—BarAlarm'd my lord! why, tho' I am naturally as brave as a lion;
yet I do not like to be taken thus by surprize; it is that which alarms
me—and Sir Palamede I am sure is at the bottom of this.De CourPerhaps then he has heard of my ar∣rival, and finding himself
discovered, means to op∣pose force by force.BarYou are right my lord, he has been send∣ing and receiving
letters and messages all night in a continual ebb and flow of
mischief.De CourS'death, can he descend so low as to mislead the rabble
into revolt—the traitor shall perish—but where is my
sister?BarI don't know my lord, but here comes my son, I dare say
he'll tell you.De CourDo not discover me yet, even to him.BarWhy my lord, as he is shortly to be related to your
lordship, I can't see that it signifies—but it shall be as you
please; harkee sirrah! come here, where is lady Elinor?Enter Edward half drunk.EdwIn her own room, I took her a cup of wine just now—but
the dear creature prefer'd ale: she seems prodigiously fond of ale.De CourWho! Lady Elinor, Sir?EdwYes Sir, Lady Elinor, my wife that is to be; what have you to
say to that? Sir!De CourPardon me Sir,—but are you as∣sured of the lady's
affections?BarAye sirrah, are you sure that she is fond of you.EdwFond of me, ha! ha! ha! dammee look at me!De CourI believe she was once attached to another, one Sir
Palamede.EdwI believe not friend, and my reason for thinking so, is that
the dear little wench never saw Sir Palamede in all her life.De CourSir, when you name that lady, you shou'd remember the
respect due to her family.Edw[Snaps his finger] That for her family—she
is a bud of beauty, which I have gather'd to wear next my heart, and the devil
may take the rest of the family-tree for me, here she comes
i'faith—Enter Adela.EdwAh! my dear lady Elinor—De CourAstonishment!—this must be some plot of
Palamede's, 
[Aside.]BarWhy, my lord, your sister does not seem to know
you.—ah, this is another quality joke, now I'll be sworn.De CourHe is deceived too! 
[Aside.]BarWhy, my lord, I think there's a very strong family likeness
between you.De CourI perceive my lord, you are imposed on, but you shall soon
be avenged.[Exit.BarHow imposed on! O, he means they have been joking on
me,—ay but he was serious;—egad, I believe I shou'd be
angry,—but then if  I shou'd be in the
wrong;—I'll e'en go after him and ask whether I ought to be in a
passion or not.[Exit.AdelaWhy, I say Edward, the Lady Elinor's attendants did call me
their lady for the jok's sake; yet it must soon be out that I am
myself.EdwThat's not unlikely.AdelaAnd if Lady Elinor shou'd be as hand∣some, as we heard, and
your father shou'd be very pressing—EdwThen you think I shou'd desert you!—hah.AdelaYour deserting me wou'd then be called by another name, for
fine folks have fine names for bad actions, to make them seem like good
ones.EdwWhy, look'ye. my dear Adela,—I was always a blundering
fellow at a fine speech; [ecod I am like my father for that,] but if I
thought my being a nobleman wou'd make me love you a jot the less, deuce take
me if I had not rather remain a ploughman all my life,—now do you believe
me?AdelaI do.AIR— Adela.Love from the heart, all its danger concealing,Reason they say, the fond spell can remove;But bliss kindly stealing,Still the delusion so sweet may I prove.For should you betray me, your falsehood
per∣ceiving,Too well do I love you, the peril to shun:So if you must cheat me, still further deceiving;Oh! blinded by hope, to the last leads me on.SCENE—The Sea at the back of the stage and a light
house,—a part of the Tower is seen, the cellar door by the second
wing;—a little further, a flight of stairs leading to a
door,—stage lights down.Enter Lady Elinor solus.Why, did I not insist on Sir Palamed eexplaining this
mystery?— [She retires up the stage.]Enter Lord William,Welcome, thrice welcome, ye scenes which re∣mind me of happier
days;—every step I take—every object of remembrance, warms me
with new incitements to assert my birthright,— [Lady Elinor comes forward,] How Lady Elinor!L. EliO Palamede! for heaven's sake, why this mystery?L. WilSpare me the explanation of what is yet improper for you to
know;—shew me esteem by confiding in my honour,—he who is
beloved by you, cannot act unworthily.L. EliI am uneasy only on your account,—therefore do not
flatter me, or keep me longer in suspence!L. WilTo night is the Crisis of my fate, and to-morrow's sun
shall dispel the cloud of mystery in which it is involved.DUET— Lord William and Lady Elinor.Lady Elinor.Dangers unknown impending,Doubt multiplies my fears,Lord William.Laurels my steps attending,Shall spring from beauty's tears.Lady Elinor,Thus in suspence to leave thee,Lord William.Think'st thou, I can deceive thee?Lady Elinor.—To leave thee.Lord William.—To leave thee!Both.Say, wilt thou still prove true?Yes, I will still prove true.And must we bid adieu?[Exit Lady Elinor,L. WilCruel concealment, yet it must be so, one only have I
trusted in this castle and he is here.Enter Hugo, sword on.HugoAh! my dear young master, what plea∣sure does your old
servant feel, in seeing you once more in your native land! Heaven help us,
what strange events have happened, since the good baron your father quitted
England.—I long to hear your adventures in France.L. WilIt is a long story my friend.HugoSo much the better,—I like long stories,—I often
tell long stories myself,—re∣membrance forms the old man's banquet,
and let the viands be ever so ordinary, memory cooks them to his liking.L. WilHugo this is not time for words, I must support my claim to
the honors of my ancestors and this hour,—HugoWhat my lord?L. WilHear me! I have written to an old and allied friend of my
father's, a powerful nobleman, and near the king's person, he has assured
me of  my sovereign's favour,—and I expect hourly
letters from the king, acknowledging me Baron of Oakland.HugoWell my lord!L. WilIn the mean time my zealous friend. has advised me to
surprize the castle without delay, to man all resistance to the king's
commands.HugoSurprize the Castle! why my lord, I'll fight as long as I can,

[draws his sword.] but here are only two of
us.L. WilGood old man! I shall not need your assistance, a guard
of an hundred chosen troops sent by the good Lord Hubert, enter'd the
village in the dusk of the evening;—the news of my return is receiv'd
by the vassels with transport, and they are this momemt arming in my
cause.HugoThen, why do we stay here, I'll go and get on my armour?L. WilIt is not yet time;—the tolling of the Curfew will give me
notice when all is ready: but tell me Hugo, was not my father's armour kept in
an apartment in that Tower?HugoYes, my lord in that very apartment over the wine cellar.L. WilAnd has the armour ever been removed from thence?HugoNever! I'll answer for that,—the room has been shut up
these ten years past to my know∣ledge; I have still preservd my key to the door which leads to it
thro' the long gallery,L. WilGive time, 
[Hugo gives a key,] now let us be gone.HugoExcuse me my lord, I'll follow you to battle; but not into
that apartment.L. WilWhy not?HugoAh, my lord I tremble at the thoughts of it, no living soul
has enter'd that room for these ten years,—voices have been heard and
lights  seen,—in short it is haunted, and tho' I
lov'd your worthy father when he was alive—I,—I,—I, 
[light is seen at a window in the Tower.]L. WilBy heav'n's a light appears thro' the casement at this
moment.HugoAnd so there does, my dear master don't be rash.L. WilHark! I hear a noise from the Tower, wait for me here, 
[draws] and beware your fears do not betray you, 
[goes up the steps and unlocks the door and
exit.]HugoMy lord,—my dear lord William don't leave me
alone!—he's gone!—oh that cursed Haunted Chamber! I can't stay
near it—I,—I, find the only means of perserving my courage is to
carry it along with me.[Exit.Enter Baron.Why, sure that was old Hugo, yes and with his sword drawn,
oh, he's in the plot!—O lord! O lord! there's the spirit playing his
illumination tricks in the Haunted Chamber;—Oh, how I long to attack this
old rogue Hugo, because I am sure I cou'd beat him;—aye, but then I
dare not venture alone, valour with me is of a companiable nature and don't
like solitude;—My courage is something like the vine, to produce good
fruit it must be well supported;—hey, sure I hear some∣body
coming out of my wine-cellar!—egad, I'll step aside, I may make
some discoveries here.[Retires,Enter Robert and Martin from the Cellar
door.RobWell my boy, now I have made you free of our cellar.Mar[Half drunk] Give me your hand, give me your hand,
Master Robert, I'll live and die with you, of all inventions that ever were
thought of, there's none to my mind like good eating and drink∣ing.RobAnd for that, Martin, I'll match all Kent, I know the privilege
of a diligent butler too well  to suffer my master to
taste wine till I have approv'd of it.Bar[Aside] Oh! the villianMarThat's right, that's right, give me your hand again; O Master
Robert! what a happy dog you are to have the command of such a wine
cellar.RobAy, Martin, there I sit, absolute monarch of all the
prostrate bottles.Bar[Aside] Mighty well!—but I'll be even with
you rascalls. 
[Exit into the Cellar,]Enter Servant.RobWell, can you find friend Lewis, in the garden?SerNo master Robert.RobHe has certainly lost his way, let us go in search of him,
Martin?MarAye, Master Robert, do you go one way and I'll go the
other.RobAnd to prevent accidents I'll lock the cellar door for the
present, we'll soon return and finish the evening.

thank heaven! I who have no noble blood in my veins have the dearest of all
pri∣vileges, that of chusing a husband for myself.AIR— Cicely.From high birth and all its fetters,My kind stars my lot remove;I shall envy not my betters,Give me but the youth I love.Love's the riches of the poor,A prize that wealth can ne'er procure;My rich mistress fain wou'd beJust as poor as Cicely.From high birth, &c.Enter Adela and Robert.AdelaThese waiting maids pester me to death with questions,

off her gaurd, endeavour to provoke her and gratify your curiosity.L. EliWhy, I shou'd like it, but she looks as if she could beat
me;—pray madam wou'd your ladyship please to go to bed?AdelaNo, my ladyship does not please to go to bed.RobNo, her ladyship does not please to go to bed.L. EliIt is my duty to wait on your ladyship.AdelaWell. wait in another room then.RobAye, wait in another room.L. EliPray my lady forgive me.AdelaNo, I will not forgive you!—I can't hear it

drinking, so I'll drink with you if it is only to shew you I like your
company.MarBut you have'nt told me yet about this Haunted Tower.LewWell, I declare I'm glad of it for your sake, for I am sure
you must be dry after telling such a long story.RobCome my boys, lend me a hand,

three-legg'd floos. Robert sits at the head of the table, Martin and Lewis on
each side.]LewWhat have we got here?RobSome of the best wine in Christendom, my lad; aye, and
some of the best ale too, which to me, is the best of all
liquors;—the scurvy old knave, my master, who I dare say is a-bed
and a sleep, little thinks the honour we are doing to his cellar.Lewis and MartinHa! ha! ha!RobNow for't my boys, here's to ye!CATCH— Robert, &c. &c.As now we're met, a jolly set,A fig for sack or sherry;Our ale we'll drink,And our cans we'll clink,And we'll be wondrous merryMerry, my hearts—merry, my boys,We'll sing with a hey down derry,The baron himself knows no such joys,We are so wondrous merry.RobCome, drink about, 
[sings] "And we'll be wondrous merry."L. Wil[Behind, imitates Robert.] "And we'll be wondrous
merry."RobHey day! what's that?LewThat, oh! that's an echo, I suppose.RobAn echo! I never observ'd one here, I—MarO Master Robert! is'nt this the chamber you said was
haunted?LewEgad then, its haunted by a jolly spirit—so here's to
the ghost!— [sings] "And we'll be wondrous merry."L. Wil[Behind, in Lewis's voice] "And we'll be wondrous
merry," 
[a noise underneath the stage.]RobWhat think ye now?LewWhy, I think there's a damn'd noise in the cellar, 
[The trap door that Robert had pointed to is thrown open
and knocks down the table, which they had placed on it, and the Baron appears
coming thro' it.BarGentlemen, your most obedient, pray don't let me disturb
you, pray go on, my butler here, sets you a good example; so pray make free
with my property,—upon my life this is a very pretty Chamber to be
haunted; the ghost has an excellent choice, but I never knew that your
troubled spirits were, such consummers of ale and wine before. 
[a knocking at door,] pray who is that? is it any
friend or your's gentlemen.MarYes, please your worshipful honour, it is only Hubert with
the supper.BarO! Hubert with the supper, is it? desire him to walk in 
[the Baron opens the door. Enter Hubert with some beef
and bread.] Come in Hubert, here are none but friends, O never mind me,
come put the supper on the table. 
[Hubert puts it on the ta∣ble] And now gentlemen
sit down and eat heartily.LewI am much oblig'd to your honour, but I am not hungry now.RobIf but your honour wou'd but hear me.BarO! with a great deal of pleasure, honest Robert, I was but
ill situated in the cellar to hear that catch you sung just
now;—rogues! rascals! robbers! whose only sign of fear is, you
can't bear your own consciences, so you are afraid of spirits; where's
the echo, you conjur'd up just now?RobIndeed! me lord, we heard an echo.BarDid you? well, sing again then, and let me hear it, I'll
shew you a pattern of resolution you rapscallions.RobNow mark my lord, 
[sings] "And we'll be wondrous merry."L. Wil[Behind in Robert's voice] "And we'll be wondrous
merry."Bar[Alarm'd] Egad, but its an odd sort of an
echo.LewSuppose your honour was to speak to it, perhaps it wou'd
answer you civilly.BarO! I dare say 'twill have a proper respect for my
dignity,—what are you ghost or spirit?L. Wil[In Baron's voice.] "Ghost or spirit."Bar[Very much frighten'd] O lord! O
lord!—why!—why! don't some of you speak to
me?—what—what,—are you afraid of?—Robert, what makes
you look so pale?—for my part—I!—I!—I don't believe
in apparitions, do you friend? 
[to Lewis.]Hugo[Behind] Lord William, my dear master Lord
William!RobHark my lord! there's a voice.BarOh! I am a lost man,—but—why,—do you all
tre-m-b-le so! 
[a bell tolls] O lord! there's the Curfew going at
this hour.A Trumpet is heard at a distance, Lord William throws open
the doors and walks with great solemnity in his father's armour, and exit.
The trumpet is heard till he is quite off. The Baron &c. retire very much
frighten'd.BarO, dear me it is the old Baron's ghost! I have seen him wear
that shield and helmet a thou∣sand times.Lew[During this speech of the Baron's, creeps round, as
looking after Lord William.] O! my lord here's more miracles! the
spirit has met some armed men and they are all fighting,—that's
right,—that's right;—well done my boys—dammee they have
kill'd the ghost, huzza.AllHuzza,—huzza!—BarEgad, that's rare news, come lets go and see what its all
about, I'll lead the way, do you fol∣low me,—hey—no Robert, you
shall go first;—no,—no,—stop, come back—we'll all
go together, and then we can take care of one another— [drums and trumpets heard.][They exeunt very much alarm'd.SCENE—An Apartment in the Castle, drums and trumpets
without.Enter Edward and Adela [Edward with a
sword and shield.]AdelaO Edward! I am frighten'd to death! it was an unlucky day for us
when I turn'd fine lady and nothing but unlucky days have we had ever
since.EdwLucky or unlucky,—I fancy there's an end of 'em now, bad
as the days were, I wish they were to come over again.Enter Baron, [with his sword drawn, and some old
armour aukwardly put on.BarO dear! O dear, they are all at it.EdwWhat! what are they at?BarWhy, fighting, O my Lady Elinor! why don't you order your
soldiers to fall on?—O how I hate a man that won't fight.AdelaWhat, is any body kill'd my lord!BarKill'd, why we shall all be kill'd, men, women and
children.Enter Lady Elinor finely dress'd.L. EliFor shame my lord! why do you stand idle here? your
soldiers call on you to head 'em,—where's my brother?BarYour brother, why what signifies your brother, why they are
thirty thousand strong.L. EliI mean the Lord de Courcy.[Exit.BarThe Lord de Courcy,—why an't you—AdelaO, no indeed my lord, I am not,—I am quite sick of
passing for a fine lady.Enter Servant.SerMy lord, you must come immediately, they are forcing the
castle gates.[Exit.BarForcing the castle gates, O lord I shall die of a fright!
and never live to be kill'd.[Exit Baron, Edward and Adela.SCENE—Changes to the Hall, after alarms of drums and
trumpets.Enter Edward and Adela.EdwThey have gain'd the Citadel, and we shall be put to the
sword.Enter De Courcy, Lord William and
Knights.De CourOnce more my noble friend, I congra∣tulate you on your
success.Enter Lady Elinor, Cicely and
Charles.L. EliMy brother!De CourMy father contracted you in marriage with the young Baron of
Oakland;—I present him to you, I deem'd him my enemy till I knew him,
it is now my pride to call him my friend.L. WilThis is a more valuable present my lord, than the life you
gave me, when overpower'd by your soldiers in the garden you, still thought
me your enemy.Enter the Baron between two armed Men.BarO dear! spare my life, and I'll agree to any terms.Adela[To Lord William.] then Sir, begging your pardon
for my boldness, I suppose you are the ghost we heard of?BarYes, and you I suppose are the sham Lady Elinor, we have
heard of; egad, now I find how things are, I have reason to be in a
passion.L. WilYou Sir, 
[to Baron] have a right to an explanation, I
scorn to owe my title to force; I am confirmed by my sovereign in the
dignity and estates of my father:—be assured however, that I
shall be ambitious to prove myself your friend.BarAnd that's an ambition I shall be very glad to gratify you
in.L. Wil[to Edward and Adela] As for this young couple, I
hope I shall have the satisfaction of adding to their store of Hymen's
comforts.Ewd.I—Thank you my lord,—I begin to be much less
inclined to Nobility after the bustle I have seen to-night, and I'm fain to
comforts myself with the old remark,—"that a title cannot bestow
happiness."AdelaYes, but I can though there is a title for which I'd give up to
all others, it is the wife of my Edward.L. EliMy fluttering heart cannot express the joy it feels at your
triumph.

now approves it.FINALE.The banish'd ills of heretoforeAt happy distance viewing;Of the past we'll think no more,While future bliss pursuing.When engaged in Pleasure's chace,Never look behind you;Back if you shou'd turn your face,Misfortune's dust may blind you.Lord William, and Lady Elinor.Here let the titled wedded pair,A lesson take from humble life;Nor in the lady and the lord,Forget the husband and the wife.Ne'er shall th' example us reprove,Whose proudest boast shall be our love.SESTETTO.The present hour is ever ready,To assume a smiling face;If to wisdom's councels steady,Pleasure's precepts you embrace.Edward.Tho' no more I am a lord,Give my love but this reward,Rank and title I forego.Adela.No, my Edward, say not so.CHORUS.The banish'd ills, &c.FINIS.
