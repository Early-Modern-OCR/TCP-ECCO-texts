ALZUMA, A TRAGEDY. AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL IN COVENT-GARDEN.Humana ante oculos faedè cum vita jaceretIn terris oppressa gravi sub religione.LUCRET.LONDON: Printed for T. LOWNDES, No. 77, in Fleet-Street.MDCCLXXIII.Advertisement.THE precept, which directs a poet to keep his piece nine years, has been fully observed in regard to the following Tragedy; but the Author will not claim the merit of voluntary submission to critical authority. The delay, he acknowledges, did not arise from choice, but was rather the consequence of difficulties that stood in his way, and prevented an earlier access to the public.The Play was written in the year 1762, and the British forces were then actually doing at the HAVAN NAH, what ALZUMA prays for in the third act. The subject appeared of the first importance to the interests of humanity. In perusing the history of the Spanish conquests in AMBRICA, the AUTHOR found among unenlightened savages such instances of generosity, truth, justice, courage, and even clemency, as would have done honour to those, who profess'd in that part of the world to spread the light of truth and civilization. The behaviour of ATA-HUALPA (called by English writers ATABALIPA) the last INCA of PERU, in his intercourse with FRYAR VINCENTI, appeared particularly striking. He heard the SPANISH MISSIONER with calm attention, and replied, that it was absurd on the part of the POPE to grant away a territory which did not belong to him; he would still continue to venerate the gods of his ancestors; and if the christians worshipped a god that died, he adored the sun that never died. He viewed the the prayer-book, which the fryar put into his hands, and after saying that it conveyed to him no information, threw it down with a smile. By this honest simplicity, which would have gained the affections of a generous mind, FATHER VINCENTI was so enraged, that he gave the word of command, crying out, "Kill the dogs, who trample under foot the word of God." An incident like this could not fail to excite indignation; and that indignation rose still higher, when it appeared that articles
of high treason were in form exhibited against ATAHUALPA, and, after that execrable farce of state, the prince of a world just discovered suffered as a rebel to the Emperor Charles V.—When GUATIMOZIN, one of the leading chiefs, lies stretched upon the rack, and, hearing the groans of his fellow sufferer, asks him, in perfect tranquillity, Am I upon a bed of roses? the heart, that does not melt with tenderness for the American, must be as hard as FRYAR VINCENTI'S. Not to multiply instances, the story of a people massacred because they abounded in gold-mines, and had not heard the important truths of the christian religion, seemed of all others the fittest for the English stage, as it tended in a strong degree to that pathetic distress, and that vigour of sentiment, which constitute the essential beauty of tragedy.The author regretted that such a genius as DRYDEN had not left a play, free from the jingle of rhyme, and of a more legitimate kind, that the present attempt might have been excluded. He regretted also, that, from DRYDEN's time, the poets of this nation seem to have abandoned the poor Americans to their fate. He knew that FRANCE was in possession of a beautiful play upon the subject: but the taste of LONDON and PARIS being very different, the late Mr. AARON HILL's translation of that piece, appeared upon the English stage and vanished.The present writer was of opinion that so interesting a subject ought not to be neglected. His first design was to new mould the ALZIRE of VOLTAIRE, not in a vain presumption that he could excel a writer so justly famous throughout Europe, but with an idea that he could in some instances adapt the scenes to the relish of an English audience. That plan, however, was soon deserted: it occurred, that if this author followed the steps of MONSIEUR DE VOLTAIRE, the words, FRENCH TRANSLATOR, UNBLUSHING PLAGIARY, would fill the columns of every news-paper. To civilities of this
kind the author has been used. If the persons who have been so liberal feel themselves disposed to lavish their favours on the present occasion, they will perhaps be glad of a hint, that may supply ample materials. If they will look into the plays of SOPHOCLES and EURIPIDES, they will perceive in what school the writer of ALZUMA has studied the art of constructing a fable.Aspice ut exuvias veterumque insignia nobisAptemus.—VIDA POETIC.There was another reason for not adhering to the plan of VOLTAIRE: In a country like this, it was thought that our scene ought not to be indebted to a foreign writer for a play, which involves the first great point of human liberty, namely, the right of man to think for himself. In this opinion ALZUMA was written, and (except a few minute corrections in the course of the rehearsals) was, in its present form, ready for the stage above ten years ago.There were, indeed, at that time certain reasons, which made the author unwilling to precipitate himself into a dealing with managers. Those reasons subsisted till Nov. 1767, when this tragedy was put into the hands of Mr. GARRICK. It was copied out by the prompter of Drury-Lane theatre, but remained in suspence till Sept. 1770, when the Author found it upon his table, without a letter, or even a card. The play, it is true, was not pronounced unworthy of representation, but certainly was treated as a piece that did not deserve the least dispatch. Delay was studied, and the reasons for that delay existed no where but in Mr. GARRICK's imagination. A certain political society, he was sure, would damn any production known to come from the pen of the present writer. Time, however, has shewn that he had not given umbrage to any set of men whatever. In political controversy he had not meddled for a number of years, and he takes this opportunity to declare, that in his
whole life he never was the author of one clandestine line. Whatever he writ, he had the spirit and honour to avow it. Mr. GARRICK was told this, but without effect: the play was thrown back upon the author's hands, he submitted to it, and would have consigned all the circumstances of that transaction to oblivion, if the same policy had not been practised upon him, in another inftance, this very winter.That ALZUMA has at length appeared, is owing to the friendship of Mr. HARRIS. He desired to draw forth the piece from the author's closet: Mr. COLMAN accepted it with great frankness; and from that instant went right forward without delay, without duplicity, without equivocation. The author takes this opportunity to thank all the proprietors of Covent Garden Theatre for the fairness of their dealings: His thanks are also due to the performers for their assiduity in preparing the play for representation. The rest is before the public: Mr. BENSLEY and Mr. HULL did justice to their respective characters: Mr. SMITH's exertion of distinguished merit is well known. Miss MILLER struggled even in illness for the public favour, and Mrs. HARTLEYS' beauty and elegant performance adorned every scene, in which she appeared.The Author cannot conclude without declaring, that (exclusive of his late transaction with Mr. COLMAN) he has every reason to be disgusted at the internal occurrences of a theatre. It is, therefore, probable that he shall never again be a candidate for Theatical Fame: From the farce of the APPRENTICE to the tragedy of ALZUMA his endeavours have at all times met with a most generous reception from the Town: He feels the obligation with the warmest sensibility, and remains with due respect to the PUBLIC,Their most obedient humble servant, ARTHUR MURPHYLincoln's-Inn, Feb. 27, 1773.PROLOGUE.Spoken by Mr. BENSLEY.WHEN first COLUMBUS left the Spanish shoreIn western climes new regions to explore;Soon a new world, beyond the Atlantic main,Disclos'd the wonders of it's vast domain;A race of men unletter'd, and untaught,Strangers to science, yet with virtue fraught.—No school they had of philosophic pride,And simple reason was their only guide.That reason in the paths of nature trod,And worshipping the Sun, they meant a God;Free from the ills in polish'd life that spring,And gold with them was a neglected thing.But Europe's sons felt gold's resistless swayTo the new hemisphere they bend their way;Through ev'ry region carry sword and sire,And bigot rage and avarice conspire.Zeal bore the cross and poniard in it's hand,And massacre unpeopled half the land.Yet to unhappy men, to heroes slain,The British muse denies her tragic strain.Dryden alone let fall the gen'rous tear,And bade on Albion's stage the FEATHER'D CHIEFS appear.His voice suppress'd, no bard their fate has sung,Silent our scene, and mute each tuneful tongue;While GREECE and ROME swell'd our theatric state,And only classic heroes could be great.This night our author, an advent'er grown,Dares trace the virtues of the Torrid Zone.If in his scenes well painted passion glow;If there you view the draught of human woe;Britons will mark, from fierce religious zeal,What dread calamities weak mortals feel;
Will hear the INDIAN—tho' in error blind,Against the pow'r that would opinion bind,Assert the freedom of the human mind.Ye critics, to whom poets must be civil,As Indians worship, out of fear, the devil,Of mod'rate principles you'll own the merit,Nor hither bring a persecuting spirit.Let modes of wit some TOLERATION share;Rome KILLS for error;—Be it yours to spare.Dramatis Personae.ALZUMA, Mr. SMITH.PIZARRO, Mr. HULL.DON CARLOS, Mr. BENSLEY.OZMAR, Mr. PERRY.GONZALEZ, Mr. GARDNER.EZMONT, Mr. THOMPSON.ORAZIA, Miss MILLER.ORELLANA, Mrs. HARTLEY.Virgins of the Sun,Miss PEIRCE, Mrs. WILLEMS, Miss WEWITZER, Miss BROWN, &c.Scene at CUSCO the Capital of PERU.ALZUMA.ACT I.Enter EMIRA.WEARIED at length by their own raging toil,Her spirits sink to rest: kind sleep affordsThe only boon the wretched mind can feel,A momentary respite from despair.Enter ZILIA.Emira.Who's there?—That look alarming!—Zilia, sayWherefore this sudden haste?—How fares it nowWith Orellana?Zilia.Still a calm reposeSuspends the tumult of the mighty passions,That war within. Nature quite harrass'd downRepairs the waste of grief.Emira.But oh! too soonWith keener sense to waken her againTo the strong agonies that rend her soul.How wears the night?—Zilia.It verges to the dawn.Emira.Then 'tis th' accustom'd hour, the only hourOf all that circle time's diurnal round,When Orellana knows suspence from pain.Zilia.The sun that form'd her, lent his brightest rays,His purest elements of sacred fire.—Hence all the virtues that but dimly shine.In breasts of common mould, in her sublim'd,Burn to a fierce extravagance of soul.Emira.Yet what avails the great indignant spirit,The gen'rous flame for Freedom and Peru?The fever of her mind too soon must endHer weary frame.—The live-long day it rages,And each returning night,—when all things elseThro' wide creation's round feel wonted rest,She only wakes to misery:—Forlorn she sitsWith streaming eyes, while unrelenting caresWaste all within; and ever and anonIn short distracted dreams wild fancy actsNew scenes of terror in her blasted mind.Enter ORELLANA.Orel.Horror! Protect me! Save me;—Seas of bloodRun purple round the altar—'tis my brother—Barbarian hold!—It is Alzuma bleeds—Inhuman murd'rers! Oh!Faints.Emira.'Tis ever thus:—Sad visionary terrors rack her brain,—Too wretched mourner, victim of despair!—Orel.Oh! 'tis too much, too much to suffer—Zilia,Art thou there?—Ever friendly, kind, and good!—Emira too!—why, sister virgins, whyMust you still labour with my weight of woe?Emira.Attending thee we but obey the callOf duty and of love.—Dispel thy fears,And hush this tumult of disorder'd fancy.Orel.Would heav'n I could!—But these imaginingsWere terrible indeed!—Round yonder couchSuch horrid phantoms rose.Emira.Forget 'em all—You've nothing now to fear.—Orel.Alas, the wretchedHave ev'ry thing to fear—Methought PizarroWith fury dragg'd me to the altar's foot;There urg'd imperious to renounce my gods,And wed Don Carlos; with apostate zealMy mother join'd her aid;—conspir'd against me;When, oh! distracting sight! my brother, rushingTo save a sister from the vile dishonour,Receiv'd Pizarro's dagger in his heart.—The altar smoak'd with gore;—the cruel SpaniardLook'd a grim joy to see the only hopeOf desolate Peru,—a Prince descendedFrom a long race of Kings, ignobly fall,And welter in his blood before him.Emira.Yet,These are but fancied ills—Alzuma livesSafe in obscurity, far hence remote.Prostrate Peru may lift her head again,And heav'n restore a brother to your arms.Orel.Delusive thought! Yet let me fondly cherishThe soothing flattery.—Oh! Sister virgins,Should e'er the hero bless my longing eyes,I could embrace him with a sister's love,And in his sight forget my sorrows past.But oh! vain hope!—He would not know me nowThus with'ring in my bloom—As yet an infantnumber'd scarce ten years, when hence he went
To Chili's realms, ere the foe burst upon us,—To learn the course of ev'ry orb above,And all the myst'ries of his parent sun.Mean time the Spaniard—but I'll not retraceThat tale of horror.—Since that hour accurst,Ten times the sun hath made his annual circle,Nor yet Alzuma reigns!—Alas! my virgins,Distinction's lost amongst us, and the lastSurviving Inca of undone PeruSinks to a slave,—a wand'rer o'er the land!—Emira.Rekindle not the fury of your soul—For lo! with purple light the orient mornGlows in yon Eastern clime!—Don Carlos soon,As is his wont, with early importunityWill press his ardent suit. Be timely cautious,Nor let him find pale grief and discontentFor ever dwell in Orellana's breast.—'Twill rouze the Spaniard's rage—a cloyster'd virginWith thee, I worship'd the eternal fire.—'Tis friendship prompts, if I presume to wishYou'd not provoke the foe.Orel.I know thy truth,Thy constancy approv'd;—and Carlos tooI grant has qualities that claim respect.Emira.Tho' other gods he worship, yet in himReligion wears a gentler mien, nor servesTo sanctify rapacity and murder.—'Tis love perhaps,—for sure he fondly loves—'Tis love perhaps,—not virtue,—that allaysHis fiercer passions,—but whate'er the cause,He is our shield from stern Pizarro's rage:To him unnumber'd millions lift their hands,And thank him with their tears for life preserv'd.—Orel.'Tis true, Emira—oft I've known him checkThe rage of wasting war—oft at his voice
Ev'n Persecution rests upon her altar,Thirsting for blood in vain.—And yet this heartWas never form'd for him—yon radiant God,Tho' each revolving day he rise to viewHis once lov'd region, now a land of slaves,To see the Spaniard triumph in his guilt,Nor rolls th' avenging thunder o'er his head,Nor sends the rapid light'ning down to blast him,Tho' he disdain not still to shine alikeOn vice and suffering virtue—Ha! no more—'Twere impious madness—thou creat'st us all,Thou glorious luminary!—Thou the sourceOf light, and life, and universal good!From thee we issue, and to thee return!Thou mighty parent! (kneel down) Thou bright orbit, ThouStill inexhausted lead'st the radiant years,Thro' all creation pour'st thy golden flood,Thy vivid energy—without thee noughtOr fair, or useful springs—to thee all natureWafts up her orisons;—to thee I swearWhate'er shall prove the fate of Orellana,Thy sacred beams shall never,—never see herLeagu'd with her country's foes; shall ne'er behold herA vile apostate from her holy vow.—Enter EZMONT.Emira.Ezmont, why sudden thus—and hark! unfold—A flourish of trumpets.What means that musick, that triumphant joy?Ezmont.With early zeal Pizarro seeks the altarTo celebrate his foreign rites.—Orell.And fireHis unrelenting heart to new exploits.Ezmont.A captive band from various prisons ledWalk in his train, and follow to the temple,There to abjure their country, and their gods,Or meet their instant doom.—Orel.And does my motherAttend the guilty pomp?Ezmont.She does—with herAll their whole courtier-band attend Pizarro,All but Don Carlos;—with a lover's speedThis way he bends his steps;—my swiftest zealCould scarce outstrip him.—Orel.Leave me virgins, leave me—Ezmont I thank thy care. (they go out.) Now summon allThy calmest patience, and thy firm resolve.Enter DON CARLOS.Carlos.Let this auspicious morn dispel thy cares,And each successive hour on balmy wingsBring peace, bring health, and beauty's roseate bloom;—Does Orellana shun me?—hither turnThy gracious aspect; let those azure eyesBeam with their gentlest radiance.—Orel.Those eyesWith galling tears have long since lost their lustre—They, like the daughters of rapacious Spain,Have not yet learn'd to gild the cloud of woe,Inspire the look, and animate the glance,While misery lays desolate the heart.Carlos.Let love diffuse his cordial o'er thy spiritsSoon shall each grace awaken, soon thy heartBeat sprightly notes of rapture and of joy.Orel.Oh! talk not, Carlos, to a wretch forlorn,And lost as I am,—do not talk of joy.
No more shall pleasure visit this sad form,This breathing statue of despair.Carlos.DespairBut ill requites th' indulgent care of heav'n,That now invites thee to enjoy with meYour share of love, and empire.—Orel.Take again,Take back your vows of friendship and of love.—I do entreat you take'em—bear'em henceTo the bright dames that grace your native land—Worthier they'll listen to you—they have heartsProne to thy soft impressions—they have heartsThat never bled to see the ruthless sword,Thy sword, Don Carlos, lay their country waste;—Thou hast not injur'd them;—but oh! respectA captive wretch,—a wretch that has full cause,Yet pours no curses on thee!—Carlos.Wilt thou thus,Relentless fair! wilt thou then wound me thusWith stern reproach?—Under a father's bannerI wag'd the war; and if her purple wingPropitious victory wav'd o'er my head,The world can witness, who by me have fall'n,All bravely fell in the embattled field,Not naked and disarm'd—In me the vanquish'dHave found a friend—'T was Orellana's will.—Her conqu'ring eyes have half aveng'd her country,And made the victor beauty's willing slave.His laurels bloom for thee;—he lays his trophies,His scepter at your seet—thy native realmWooes thee to sov'reign sway, and bids thee ruleThe western world, when to her softer climeSpain shall invite thy mother.—Orel.Name her not—I would not think upon her crimes—become
The conqu'ror's wife,—oh! shameless guilt!—becomeThe frantic votarist of Spanish gods,She fires his haughty soul to tenfold rage.—This day prepares new victims—oh! my Lord,If your religion does not quite suppressThe voice of nature, save the lives of wretches;Plead thou their cause;—let me not see againThe streaming blood of innocence.Carlos.I moveBy thy command alone; and oh! bright maid,The pity I extend, will surely claimThe soft return of thine.Orell.Alas! My Lord,Much I esteem thy goodness; much I honourThy many virtues—but a holy vowForbids my love; and tell me, should I grant it,Would'st thou receive an interdicted wretch,With counterfeited smiles to thy embrace?Believe me, sir, who dares renounce her gods,Will dare be false to man.Enter PIZARRO, ORAZIA, attendants, &c.Pizarro.Come near my son,Thou seest thy father with assiduous careSpreading the glories of his king and GodO'er this new world.Carlos.My father's fervent zealShall stand time honour'd in the rolls of fame.Vanquish'd Peru thro' all her cities mournsThy vast renown in arms; it now were timeThat weary conquest should abate her rigours,And peace begin to harmonize the world.—Orazia.As yet, young warrior, our untutor'd raceTo thee is little known—an Indian mind
Is wrapp'd in errors mist's; from fabling priestsHears impious legends; in each falling show'r,Each cloud that sails upon yon azure deep,Conceives the present deity; in dreams,Which fever'd fancy forms, still thinks it hearsLoud oracles, commercing with its gods.The Daemons and the human facultiesAre then in dark conspiracy, and allIs bigot rage, and cruelty and horror.—This gloom must be dispell'd; and force, my son,'Tis force must execute the holy work.Carlos.And think we then our duty unperform'dUnless we imitate with furious zealHeav'n's vengeance, not it's mercy?Pizarro.Justice callsFor vengeance on a blind offending world.I know my mission here—beneath the tropicThe holy cross I've borne, and in that signPizarro still shall conquer—be it mineTo stretch the ray of truth, and bid the IndianKneel and adore!Carlos.Almagro's conqu'ring armIn Chili's realm hath crush'd the savage war.The western world hath heard the hideous ruin,And suppliant courts the yoke.Pizarro.But still AlzumaLives for new tumult—Orazia.Lives to bid his motherWith tears and burning blushes hear his name.Proud, uncontroulable, and fierce of spirit;Ev'n in his earliest youth, his boyish days,When the grim tiger from the thicket rush'd,Did he once fly?—Did he not ev'n thenDare the encounter?—the fell monster gor'dHis youthful breast, and if his father's arm
Had not transfix'd the savage to the earth,Alzuma then had died.—Since that he boreThe tiger's mark, and ere the down of manhoodSprung on his cheek, went from his mother far;Grew up implacable of soul, and nowWith dire alarms shakes all the Western World.Carlos.And if our crimes provoke—Pizarro.Our crimes, my son!Orazia.That thought to Orellana owes its birth;In soft captivity she holds him bound;Her beauty leads him with a single glance,Moves with a sigh and softens with a tear,And love and grace by turns dispute his heart.Pizarro,Hear Orellana—say, thou beauteous mourner,How long shall tears and slow consuming griefDeform thy native graces?Orel.Pardon, Sir,If the rough manners of my native climeForm'd me in plain simplicity—unskill'dIn all the studied elegance of feature,I only know to look my honest meaning;An artless savage, a forsaken wretch,Whom joy has long forsworn!—Orazia.In Cusco's court,Where ev'ry face but thine is deck'd with smiles,Such persevering sorrow ill besitsOrazia's daughter—while your mother stillEv'n with the victor shares her ancient sceptre,You have full cause of joy.—And tell me, does notThat gen'rous youth, Pizarro's gallant son,Breathe gentlest vows, and languish for your love?Orel.Ay, Madam!—Love and tenderness he brings,But sighs and tears are all I have to give.—Orazia.Away with vain excuse—thou trifler hear;Spain's pure religion calls—this moment yield,And rank thee with the faithful.—Orel.That command—Orazia.Must be obey'd.Orel.Alas! ull well you knowForce has already dragg'd me to your altar;—There while the censer wreath'd its fragrant clouds,While pealing organs swell'd the solemn note,And through deep lengthen'd isles consenting choirsHarmonious hymn'd their god,—not to your heav'nMy pray'rs were offer'd—No! ye holy pow'rsWhom long Peru hath worshipp'd,—in that hourYou rush'd between me and their Christian pomp,Bore my rapt soul to your own orbs on high,And shrines, and burning lamps, grew dim before me.Enter GONZALEZ.Orazia.Invincible in ignorance.Gonzalez.My Lord,—The slaves remain obdurate.Pizarro.Ha! rejectThe terms of proffer'd life!Gonzalez.Their eyes intentGaze on two leaders, from whose fierce demeanourThey gain new courage, obstinate in guilt.Their chiefs, by my command, attend your presence.—Enter ALZUMA, and OZMAR.Pizarro.Say, what art thou, who with indignant spiritHas dar'd to mock our laws?Alzuma.One born in freedom!
One, who while yet he lives, like frecdom's sonWill dare to think.—Pizarro.Reflect, rash youth, and takeNew life from this auspicious day.Alzuma.The day,That sees a man crouch in ignoble bondage,Sees ev'ry virtue lost.—Pizarro.Beware, thou slave!Know'st thou that instant death awaits you both?Alzuma.We know it—we expect it—we invoke it—'Twill end our misery.Pizarro.Thou insolent!—All gracious heav'n, that still delights in mercy—Alzuma.Mercy!—delights in mercy!Pizarro.Yes;—his wordGives life and peace to all—Alzuma.And darest thou then,Thou fell destroyer!—Ravager of earth!And dar'st thou then in horrid contrast standTo infinite benevolence?—Pizarro.No moreI'll parley with obdurate guilt—Gonzalez,Guard thou those miscreants; see they suffer death,And by their torments warn an impious race.—Exit with Orazia, and attendants.Orel.Oh! Carlos—gen'rous youth! If any sparkOf love dwell in thy nature, quickly fly,Pursue your cruel father, haste, prevent.The horrid murder—what have they committed?What is their crime?—Oh! do not see them bleed,For daring to be true to heav'n.CarlosI go,Thou gen'rous maid, to execute your will.Exit.Orel.Or gain their liberty, or else the hourThat sees 'em fall, will end this wretched being.(Exit after Carlos.Alzuma.And are there feelings here for human woe?Gon.Guards, lead your pris'ners hence.Alzuma.Spaniard a word.—Wilt thou indulge one moment to the wretched?—I thank thee—Ozmar, we have walk'd togetherThe rugged paths of honour;—to the lastGrappled with fate,—against the foe have strain'dBold virtue's nerve;—Oh! let it never slacken,But bear us strongly up like men, who boastSouls ever prompt for liberty or death.Ozmar.Sunk as we are, our country bleeding round us,Our cities sack't, our very gods dishonour'd,Death is relief, is victory and triumph.—Alzuma.But let us entertain our doom, my friend,In silent dignity:—Amidst our pangsLet no dejected passion tell the Spaniard,Alzuma dies in me!—Ozmar.Not all the torturesTheir vengeance can inflict, shall e'er extortOne secret from me.Alzuma.Let him shudder stillWith dire conceptions at Alzuma's name;Still let him think Alzuma roams the forest,Climbs the steep mountain's brow, or down the lakeGlides in the swift canoe to rouze the war,And call the nations to a great revenge.Let that pursue him still—Oh! let that thought,And the dire furies of detested guiltWith ceaseless pangs inhabit in his heart.Alzuma dies content!—OzmarThe tyrant's pow'rIs short liv'd o'er us, and his murd'rous rageBut sets the hero free.—Alzuma.His pow'r may shackleThese mortal limbs; but the unbodied spiritShall bear its native liberty along,To the bless'd vale behind the cloud capt hill,The silent region of departed souls,That region undiscover'd by the Spaniard!—Where our forefathers in unfading bliss,Prepare the roseate bow'r, and weave the chaplet,For deeds heroic done in life; for all,Who firm in honour, by distress unconquer'd,Have smil'd in woe, and to their graves have carriedThe sacred charter of the free born mind.END OF THE FIRST ACT.ACT II.Scene at the Gate of the Church, or Temple of the Sun.Enter ALZUMA.DOST thou not hear me, lost Peru?—Not hearThe clank of these vile chains that fetter thusYour rightful sov'reign?—Wherefore thus againLed to their Christian temple?—Why their guardsPlac'd at each pass?—Is this, just gods, a lotFor your own progeny?—Yet even here,Here still is room for fortitude and honour.Yes, ye calamities of this bad world,Pour all your destin'd malice on my head!Ye storms, ye tempests roar!

I knew thee;Parental instinct gave the sure alarm,And now to hear thee, view thee thus,—it wakesUnutterable throbbings in my breast.Alzuma.Well may'st thou view me; well may'st thou surveyThy son return'd!—He brings no foul dishonour—But thou—can'st thou—indelible reproach!—Oh! stain to virtue!—rage and indignationBurn in my soul, and kindle madness there.Orazia.Let not impetuous rage disturb thy reason.Heav'n on the Spaniards arms hath smil'd success;Thence on Peru shone forth the ray of truth,Sublimer faith, and pure exalted morals.—Alzuma.Morals!—Each word plants daggers in my heart—Oh! Give me daggers rather; arm my hand
With their own deathful steel, that I may hold itCrimson and glowing with the tyrant's blood,Aloft to view, and call my country free.Orazia.Controul this phrenzy—it were impious murder—Alzuma.Murder! a sacrifice! a glorious sacrifice!To injured men, and violated laws.—What! he that kill'd my father?And yet she pleads a fell destroyer's cause!Hold heart-strings, crack not yet—a curs'd invader,Who thins the race of man!—Ev'n now the cryOf infants murder'd at the fost'ring breast,The shrieks of virgins, dying heroes groansSound in my ear—imperial palaces,The temples of our gods all wrapt in fire!Oh! image not, my soul, the horrid scene.Orazia.I cannot bear his strong, his keen reproach.Alzuma.Yet wedded to him!—well those tears may gush,Well may those blushes glow upon thy cheek.Detested perfidy!—My father's heart,That heart, which ever beat with love of thee,Dust as it is, awakens in his tomb,Alive and sensible to guilt like thine;It stirs, it rouzes in the shroud of death,With horror at thy name, and feels it's pangs,It's tortures o'er again.Orazia.Obdurate son!Thus to transfix, and rend a mother's heart.—Alzuma.Am I upon a bed of roses?—Lo! in chainsMy bleeding country! mark in ev'ry regionThe desolation that lays waste the land!Orazia.Why wilt thou urge me to despair and horror?Oh! kill me rather; let the deadly point
Pierce to my heart; I'll arm thee for the blow.Avenge my crime; avenge your country's fall.Alzuma.What says Orazia?Orazia.Stifle in my bloodThe pious love I bear the Christian's God.Alzuma.Would'st thou debase me to the Spaniard's guilt?If thou indeed believ'st the Christian's God,It is not mine to stab for human error.Farewell! Farewell!—Live happy if thou can'st,Oh! Heav'ns, if happiness can dwell with guilt.—Going.Orazia.Yet stay, my son—one moment—Alzuma.Pow'rful nature!—Thy tender strugglings—Oh! While thus thy handI bathe with tears, and print my kisses on it,Let me implore thee, own your godsagain,My father's spirit calls—the ghastly shadesOf martyr'd millions, martyr'd for their faith,All lift their hands and call aloud for vengeance.—Orazia.Arise, my son, arise—Alzuma.Let me not sue,And clasp your knee in vain—Orazia.Oh! Strong contention'Twixt grace and nature, 'twixt my God and thee!Alzuma.Resume your dignity, your native honour—Orazia.But Heav'n prevails—Alzuma.Think of your bleeding country—Orazia.I cannot, must not hear thee—Oh! AlzumaThy mind is lost in darkness—Alzuma.How!—Orazia.Thy godsAre superstition's dreams—Alzuma.Away—no more—Rising hastily.I would not hear the voice of profanation—Go tell your tyrant, all his threats are vain—Tho' sprung from thee I still can die with glory—Farewell! we part for ever—Orazia,Hear me—hear—Alzuma.Oh! Heav'ns—Orazia—'tis the last, last timeThat e'er—may the just gods forgive thee all—Exit.Orazia.Go, cruel, fierce, inexorable son!Go, since thou wilt, to ruin, rush on death—'Twill break thy miserable mother's heart.—ORAZIA, and DON CARLOS.Orazia.Well, Sir, Pizarro now has heard your counsel.Carlos.And Orellana has heard thy advice;That Indian captive too has heard you;—allThy arts are known; thy fair hypocrisyTo varnish treason.Orazia.Oh! Thou wrong'st me much;—Another cause—a cause of tend'rest import;It is the cause of ev'ry Christian virtue;Love, justice, and humanity are in it;All that the earth holds dear, and heav'n approves.Carlos.Treason, rebellion, perfidy are in it.For Orellana's husband all your caresAre tremblingly alive.—This very day,But for thy treachery, the slave had died.Orazia.Misguided youth!—Alas! you little knowTh' eternal bar divine and human lawsHave fix'd between them—Orellana's husband!Oh! no—believe it not—Carlos.And wherefore thenAlarm'd and wild with fear?—why every art
Of tears, of shrieks, and female lamentation,To snatch the rebel from the stroke of justice.Orazia.Alas! these tears flow from the tend'rest sourceThat wakes soft pity in the human heart.Carlos—I cannot speak—Carlos.Ha! Now by Heav'nI see it all—guilt can no more dissemble—That look betrays the secrets of the heart.—The fraud stands manifest to view—Orazia.Yet hear me,Oh! Carlos, hear me, nor afflict thyselfWith false, with vain surmise—Orazia's caresAre busy for the wretched—Carlos.Has she then,Perfidious fair!—has Orellana marriedThat base-born peasant?—And does he hopeWith her, in evil hour, to claim the crown?That is your aim; for that I am deceiv'd—That care you colour with the specious nameOf generous sympathy for human kind.Orazia.I feel it here—These are unbidden drops—Tis you, rash youth, you, Carlos, that can giveFair virtue's semblance to each wild emotionThat prompts the sudden deed—ere now 'twas love,That tyrant of thy soul, capricious love,Nay, gen'rous if you will; 'twas that which sav'dThe lives of men, if Orellana smil'd;And now she looks averse, the baleful charmStill shoots delicious poison thro' thy soul,And persecuted men must pay the forfeitOf maiden blushes, and of coy disdain.Carlos.Think'st thou Don Carlos means to live the slaveOf idle charms, and tyrant beauty's frown?No—let her charms neglected fade and perish.
May sorrow wither ev'ry nameless graceThat revell'd once in those deluding eyes.Then let her lover gaze on faded beauty;Let him enjoy—Oh! no—the slave shall die—Then shall his pale inanimated corseGlare in her view, an offering from Don Carlos,The token of his love.Orazia.Away; no more;Inhuman that thou art—Carlos.Then let her shriek,And rend her hair, and to his clay cold breastRivet her panting bosom—no! the traitressShall to the altar—thou shalt lead her thither,And there her blood shall expiate, her guilt.Orazia.Thou tiger nurs'd with gore! away, nor dareWith savage threats to wound a mother's ear.Carlos.The storm is gather'd, and the thunder soonShall burst in ruin on their guilty heads.ExitOrazia.Inhuman barb'rous man!—And must I leadMidst songs of triumph, and thro' festive bands,My daughter crown'd with garlands to the altar?Shall there the priest, fell minister of wrath,Force her to nuptials, which her soul abhors,Which never—No—she'll perish rather—firstGive to the cruelax that tender form!And must her mother, must I then returnAlone—heart broken—desolate—withoutMy child?—thro' arches rais'd with pomp for her?Thro' ways still redolent of ev'ry flow'r,Which, as she went, they strew'd beneath her feet?I will not lead her—no—she shall not go—Alzuma too—Oh! misery supreme!Shall he too bleed?—Thou murd'rer! hold thy hand—It is Orazia's blood thou shed'st—the God,Who died for all, will not demand his life!—
He speaks—he menaces—but see, see there!—He dies, he dies!Enter ORELLANA.Orazia.Who's there?—What would'st thou?—ha!Orel.Haste thee, Orazia haste, and instant think,Think of some means to ward th' impending stroke.Enrag'd Pizarrocomes;—Avow, your son;Peru's undoubted heir.—Orazia.It must not be—That fatal truth would overwhelm us all—Distraction—nought remains—no pow'r can save him.Enter PIZARRO, DON CARLOS, &c.Pizarro.Yes, bring the traitor forth—the sanctityOf laws, the policy of our new stateForbid all dull delay—Enter ALZUMA, GONZALEZ and Guards.Pizarrc.That once again I deign to parley with thee,'Tis gentle pity prompts—take heed, rash youth,Or certain death—Alzuma.Death is the only boonThat Spain can give, or I will deign to take.Come bloody bigot!—Reverend assassin!Come on at once—here wreak thy pious rage,And do a murder in the name of heav'n!Pizarro.Dost thou reproach us? Thou, who oft hast seenBlind superstition offer human victims,
To your own senseless, to your monstrous idols?Alzuma.Polish' barbarian!—What dost thou do less?—Pizarro.Beware, not tempt my vengeance!Alzuma.Thou art he,Who come'st to teach thy doctrine sword in hand,To tyrannize our souls; from free-born menWithhold the sacred privilege of thinking.Thou hast unchain'd, to spread destruction round,Two fiends accurst; Lo! where insatiate avariceEnslaves mankind! Lo! Spanish hierarchyErects her scarlet head; with pious rageBears in her breast a poniard, and with bloodIncarnadines the altar of her god.Pizarro.Slave mark my words.—No more I'll waste the hoursIn vain debate—Resign thyself to Spain;Abjure thy errors, and embrace the truth,Or else this moment sweeps thee from my sight,A terrible example of our vengeance.Orazia.No, by the pow'rs above he shall not die.The voice of heav'n restrains the murd'rer's hand,A voice that's heard thro' all the peopled earth,Resounding to the limits of the world.Pizarro.Beware, beware, Orazia!—Carlos.Still she favoursThat insolent, who spurns the light of heav'n.Orazia.Oh! 'tis the light of heav'n informs my soul.These strong emotions by the Pow'r SupremeWere planted here—The spirit that impelsTo blood and murder, cannot be from heav'n.Nature, thou lead'st me on—my child, my child—
I will protect thee—Now, inhuman men,Now come, and tear him from a mother's arms.Orel.Yes, both, my brother—both will perish with thee.Pizarro.By heav'n this treason!—Carlos.Orellana's brother!And not her husband!—Then my heart's at peace.Aside.Pizarro.What means this myst'ry?—Say, art thou Alzuma?Alzuma.Behold me, Spaniard; let thine eye survey me—Shrinks not thy heart within thee?—Read'ft thou notA royalty of nature here?Pizarro.ForthwithSay wilt thou take thy life on our conditions?Alzuma.There are conditions that may win my soulNot wholly to abhor thee.Pizarro.Name thy terms!Alzuma.Lay down at once the persecuting sword,Relieve from slavery a groaning world,Ask what we suffer, not what we believe,Display your morals, not your bigot faith.If avarice is your god, take gold enough;Freight well your ships, and may propitious galesIn safety waft you to your native shores.That done—in time we may perhaps forget,We may at least forgive you.Pizarro.Vanquish'd slave!And to a conqueror dar'st thou thus to utterThy stubborn pride!Alzuma.Back to your native shores!What do you here, amidst a virtuous race?Pizarro.The laws of conquest, and the laws of Spain—Alzuma.And dar'st thou, homicide, alledge the laws?The laws of Spain—know there's a prior law,To which weak mortals are not train'd, but born;Not form'd by science, but endow'd by instinct,Great nature's law!—that best, that surest guide;That emanation from the pow'rs above;O'er all diffus'd, immutable, eternal!This who snall silence, who shall dare repeal?Who strives to do it abdicates his nature;Renounces all the honours of his being,And by the act,—tho' justice ne'er o'ertake him,Pays full atonement:—He's a wretch indeed.Pizarro.I'll hear no more; since thus thy heart is steel'd,Thus obstinately fix'd in wilfull guilt,The justice that pronounc'd thy father's doom,Awaits thy crimes.—No dark assassin's stabEnded his days:—To our tribunal call'dIn full assembly of the conquering chiefsHe was arraign'd, was heard, and died for treasonTo Spain's imperial crown.Carlos.And shall that mockery,That stain to justice, that black scene of horrorBe acted o'er again?Pizarro.And dost thou too,Dost thou rebel, consed'rate in their guilt!Our will is fix'd:—ere yonder sun decline,Hear me thou slave!—or yield to truth and Spain,Or else yon sun—that idol of your worship,Shall see thee on the rack in pangs expire.Exit.Carlos.Thou brave heroic youth, thy ev'ry virtueDemands my wonder—by yon heav'n I swearThou shalt not suffer; my soul eager pantsTo know, to love, to burn in friendship with thee.Exit.Ora.Alzuma—Oh! my son—in this distressHow shall the wretched mother save her child?Alzuma.Waste not a though on me; thy own misdecds,Repent of them; and since the gods withholdA brave revenge, 'tis left us still to die,And greatly perish in our country's ruin.Gon.You must not linger here: my duty bids meConvey thee hence.Ora.Thou busy meddler!—hereOrazia now commands—I lead him forth.And who shall dare oppose a mother's voice?Exit with Alzuma.Orel.Yet grant us vengeance, heav'n; Oh! give us stillTo conquer ev'n in death, then mix triumphant,With pensive ghosts, and roam the shadowy plain,Where all is peace, all bliss in endless store,And no pernicious Spaniard thirsts for gold.END OF THE FOURTH ACT.ACT V.Scene the Temple of the Sun.Enter ORAZIA and ORELLANA.Orazia.GO, cruel go, and leave me to my woes.Orel.I feel'em all—but what, beset with ills,Can Orellana do?Orazia.What can she do?Prevent the stroke—assuage Pizarro's sury—That canst thou do, yet obstinately fix'd—Orel.But fix'd in honour—Oh! thou little know'stAlzuma's soul—He will not take a lifePurchas'd by vile disgrace; will ne'er surviveTo see Don Carlos seize my plighted hand,That he may linger out his days in bondage.Orazia.And if his ardour, if his ev'ry virtueSwell o'er their bounds, and bear his reason down,Wilt thou unpitying—the bare image strikes—Weep'st thou my daughter?—Let the gen'rous sorrowMelt thy hard heart and bid Alzuma live.Orel.Would heav'n I could! but if my brother fall,With him 'tis fix'd to die—Thrice happy bothIf ev'n in ruin our unshaken zealOur country honours, and our gods approve.—Orazia.Then go, rush on, unnatural as thou art,Go since thou wilt and see a brother bleed—I'll to the altar too—The blow that shedsAlzuma's blood will be Orazia's last.—Enter CARLOS.Car.Let joy succeed and triumph in your hearts—I bring ye gladsome tidings.—Orazia.Speak thy purpose—Car.I've seen your son—at length each raging passionTo peace subsides, and takes a milder tone.His errors vanish and with sense reclaim'dHe dedicates his soul to truth and Spain.Orel.What do I hear?—The tale of infamy—Orazia.Then is Orazia blest—my son shall live—But tell me—does Alzuma—tell me all—Means he this day—Car.This very hour he means—To offer up his vows at yonder altar;He and his chosen friends—He only asksThat while Pizarro views the solemn act,The gazing multitude may stand aloof,Nor interrupt him in his holy work.Orazia.All bounteous Providence!—now, now indeedYou give me back my son—Upon the wingOf love and rapture let me seek Pizarro,Tell him this unexpected bless'd event,That saves at once a mother and her child.Exit.Orel.Thou hear'st it, radiant Deity; thou hear'stThis worst of crimes, nor yet thy orbit halts,Nor turns its course back to the astonish'd east,Nor impious mortals dread eternal night!—Carlos.Suppress this storm of passion; smiling peaceComes with her gentle train, and love preparesHis torch to brighten all our future hours.Orel.All truth is fled; Alzuma is a slave!Carlos.Henceforth esteem and dignities await him;New joys and all that lavish hearts can pour.Orel.Let him accept them; let him meanly stoopTo take a conqueror's gifts; these are your arts,The arts of tyranny, by which you drawWith baleful luxury, with bland allurements,Each captive mind, till weak deluded men,Grown the voluptuous slaves of ev'ry vice,Become the slaves of ev'ry master too.—Car.A moment brings him to you—then you'll seeHe comes with mind enlighten'd—Truth divineWill from his lip more welcome touch thy ear,And hush to peace this tumult of thy soul.Exit.ORELLANA.The tumult of mv soul will ever rage.Well, injur'd deities, you fly a land,Where not one virtue's left—you have full cause—Ev'n your own progeny betrays your rights—To hostile gods betrays—yet let those godsBoast of their proselyte—to them he'll proveA young, a subtle hypocrite—Each vowThe traitor offers at their Christian shrineTo his own heart, to universal natureWill give the lye, and stamp the guilt upon himBy men and gods abhorr'd—the tenfold guiltOf daring to equivocate with heav'n!I will not live to see it—Ha! he comes—Enter ALZUMA.Alzuma.My sister!—why is this?—thou shun'st me then?—Thou shun'st thy brother?—Orel.Thou hast ruin'd all—Alzuma.Distract me not with thy unkind disdain—All that is great in nature leads me on—And my heart labours with the vast conception.Orel.Vain effort to dissemble!—Even nowThe strong expressive characters of guiltGlare in thy eye, and shoot their livid fires.Alzuma.Talk not of guilt—thou little know'st—Orel.Not talk,When faith and truth, the sense of ancient honourAre trampled down? when in base abject fearA brother derogates from all his race,Abjures at once his country and his gods,And with the foe capitulates for life?Alzuma.Thy virtue charms me; but thou ill dost chuseThis awful period—'tis a moment bigWith desperation, with disast'rous change,And horrible intents—I see thee nowPerhaps for the last time.—Orel.What say'st thou?—Ha!—That look terrific! But too plain I read—And yet they told me—Alzuma.Who?Orel.Don Carlos.Alzuma.What?Orel.Of gods abjur'd—Alzuma.And did'st thou hate thy brother?Orel.And can'st thou blame me?—Alzuma.I do thank thee for it—Orel.Still thou art true?—Alzuma.As heav'n's foundation fix'd!Fix'd as the marble pillars of the world.Orel.Have I then wrong'd thee?—Oh! Alzuma.—Alzuma.Come,Thou best of sisters, daughter of the sun!Worthy thy character!—Come to my heart—And yet is this a time, this hour of horrorTo pour the softest transports of the soul,And mingle tears with madness and despair?Orel.Thy words, thy looks, appall my frighted sense,Alas! my brother, ere we part—Alzuma.No more;—I charge thee urge no more—whate'er my lot,Thou'lt wonder and applaud.Orel.Yet boading fears!Let me attend thy steps.Alzuma.It must not be—Wait here thy mother's coming; with apt speechBeguile her stay—I would not have her near me—Time flies; the hour draws nigh; Immortal pow'rs!The genius of Peru!

Cleave him to the ground—Orazia.They murder him, they kill my son— forbear—Hold, ruffians, hold—Exit.ALZUMA within the Scenes.The gods, the injur'd godsDemand his blood—ORELLANA.'Tis my brother's voice—Yes, strike Alzuma; with redoubled blowAvenge a father's death.—Oh! how my heartPants in this dread suspense with hope and fear!I tremble for the event—Look down ye pow'rsAnd shield my brother's life.Exit.Enter GONZALEZ.Gonz.Wild tumult fillsThe spacious temple.—Ha! again I hear it.Whence this fierce uproar?—EnterEnter CARLOS.Carlos.Treason and murder!—sound there, sound the alarm!a flourish of trumpets, and the bell tolls.Gonz.Alas! What new event—what have the fates—Carlos.Oh! 'tis a spectacle of woe and horror!My father dies a victim to their fury.With treacherous arts Alzuma hath deceiv'd us.The rites were all prepar'd: the lawn-rob'd priestStood reverend at the altar; tapers blaz'd,Incense arose and organs fill'd the choir,When forth Alzuma came with solemn paceLooking submission—We scarce saw the blow—Wing'd with the light'ning's speed he sheath'd his daggerDeep in my father's heart.Gonz.What says my Lord?Recall the words.Carlos.Oh blind and fatal rashnessThat drew me unsuspecting to the altar!No sword, no weapon to defend his life!Yet with what force I could, with desp'rate rageI rush'd amidst their throng—Ev'n that was vain,The traitor's friends that instant clos'd around me.And I no aid could give—Why lingers thusThe tardy soldier? will no friend supplyAn instrument of vengeance?Gonz.Soon the guardsShall stop each avenue—Alzuma thenShall pay the forfeit of his horrid treason.Carlos.With lion rage he dash'd him on the ground,With his left hand grasp'd the dishevell'd hair,And round his arm the plaited locks intwiningIn gore he dragg'd him to the altar's base;
And I the while could only rend the airWith piercing cries—they held my feeble arms.Gonz.And is he martyr'd thus by savage hands,His conquest stopt, and all his laurels wither'd?Carlos.Orazia comes—she raves, she screams, she fliesWilder than winds; upon her mangled LordThrows her extended body, clasps him close;Then looking piteous up with streaming eyes,"Forbear my son—forbear: thou shalt not murder."But nought can save Pizarro from his rage—"Die, monster, die"—he cried, then tore him from herAlong the crimson marble—in despairUpward she sprung, and darting round his neckWith circling arms, entreats, implores, beseeches,Bathes his broad chest with tears, and vainly strivesTo save a husband from a murd'rer's rage:Gonz.Detested treacherous villain!Carlos.Arm, arm my friends.Arm all Peru and give the means of vengeance.Gonz.This way, my Lord—Revenge will now be ours,At yonder gate I see the faithful bands.Carlos.Do thou go forth and let the troops investThe temples round—Let ev'ry pass be clos'dThat none escape my fury. [Exit Gonzalez.] Righteous heav'n!Now in your cause stern justice lifts the sword,And the fell murderer from the altar dragg'dShall fall a victim to my just revenge.Exit.[Flourish of trumpets and bell tolls.]Enter ALZUMA and OZMAR.Alzuma.Brave Ozmar, oh!To ev'ry injur'd god this reeking blade

I am faint—I die—soft—lay me down.—Orel.Disastrous fate!Alzuma.Have I deserv'd this misery?Orazia.I die!—alas! I die—where are my children?—My Orellana—nearer—Oh! Alzuma!—Wilt thou not know me?—in this last distressNot lend a pitying hand?—Alzuma.'Tis red with blood—With horrid parricide—its touch will blastThy sad remains of life—Orazia.Approach Alzuma—Support me—Lend your hand—Yours, Orellana, yours—Life ebbs a pace—I leave ye both—I leaveMy dear, dear children—Yet to hold ye thusMakes ev'n langour smile—and sostens allThe pangs of death—Alzuma.I call each god to witness,Each cruel god, I never meant to harmThat matron breast that gave its nurture to me.Orel.Alas the agonies of death are on her.Enter CARLOS.Carlos.There fix your station guards!—Orazia tooDeform'd and gash'd with wounds! in death's embrace!Fell savage monster! Torture waits your guilt.—Orazia.Forbear, forbear; the warning hand of heav'nWith these events repays our thirst of blood—Too much has flow'd already—Let my childNow live in peace—it is my dying pray'r.—Alzuma.Dost thou forgive thy horrible assassin?—Orazia.'Twas not thy guilt—Mischance, 'twas dire mischanceThat wrought the deed—I thought they murder'd thee,I flew—thy mother flew to save her child—In that sad moment—Oh!—Orel.Yet spare her heav'n!Alzuma.She dies in torment.—Orazia.No, Alzuma, no—I feel no pain my child—In me thou seestHow an expiring christian suffers death—Thou God of mercy—ha!—hold!—raise me up—Alzuma, where, where ar't thou?—Yet a wordIf ever I was dear—if ever—Oh!—Dies.Alzuma.She's gone; she's gone; and with her dying breathPardon'd her murderer!—Could she then forgive me?Is that a christian virtue?Carlos.'Tis the virtueWhich you have spurn'd; but since th' expiring saintGranted her pardon,—Spain accords it too!—Alzuma.Strike me, just gods, deep to the center—hereI stand a parricide—a mother's bloodStill glows upon this hand!—And are ye notGods of just vengeance? Will your wrath permitA wretch like me to stalk the groaning earth?
Ye mountains hide me!—Oh! no place can hideA deed accurs'd like mine!Falls down.Orel.And do I liveTo see my mother thus?—A ghastly form!A little while and those dead lips had utt'rance!That heart beat warm with gen'rous affection!Thus do I see thee? Is this mangled corseAll that is left me of thee?Carlos.She, like meHas lost a parent—Lend her your assistance,My friends, support her weak and tender frame.Alzuma. (Rising on his knees)She gave me being, and this impious handHath giv'n a stab to nature: to the wombThat brought me forth, bears the assassin's knife;I wait just pow'rs for your dread pleasure: strikeHere—strike at once; launch your red vengeance down—Punish and pity me!—Carlos.His woes are greatAnd his heart lab'ring with the strong compunctionSpeaks the soul big with ev'ry gen'rous instinct,Wild nature's growth—Forgive me, oh, my father,Who there liest stretched in death—if I respectThe virtues of a foe—Alzuma rise—Repentance may efface—Alzuma.Away, nor talk (starting up)Of fruitless penitence—no gods can pardonA crime like this—See there those glaring orbs!That bosom gor'd by this destructive hand!—Orazia!—oh that look, that smile in deathDamns me beyond all depth—And yet I mustI will approach her (kneels down by her) I no more can murder thee—Where are your tortures, Spaniard? Lo! that sight—Tear out—dissect my heart.—Carlos.Alzuma hear me—In thee I have beheld the fierce extremeOf savage virtue—for a father lostYou've laid a scene of blood—But now beholdA Christian's virtue—By thy fatal armMy father there lies dead—and I forgive you—Alzuma.Forgive!—Forgive me said'st thou!Carlos.Yes, nay more;I pity your misfortunes—for your countryYou've bravely fought! and I applaud your valour.For the mistaken zeal which here by slaughterWould plant the worship of the God of peace,I do disclaim it all—That righteous GodWho gave the sun its light, and from his handLaunch'd forth the stars into the void immense,He tells weak erring man—We may persuadeOur fellow creatures to embrace their good,But ev'n for truth itself must not destroy.Orel. (Rising up)Oh! wherefore, Carlos, were those godlike virtuesTo this sad hour conceal'd! Christians and IndiansBoth, both have err'd alike—The crueltyThat mark'd its way with blood, provok'd revenge:But this your effort of unheard of goodness,Bids us repent ev'n of our country's love,Ev'n of our gods, and Orellana's heartTurns christian at the thought!—Alzuma.Oh, lost Peru!Fall'n, fall'n indeed!—thy foe was hithertoA robber, and a murderer!—now he conquers;Now his religion triumphs—all thy gods,Oh, land belov'd! thy gods prepare for flight,They yield to some divinity unknown,Some great first cause of all!—and shall you sun
Move at a maker's will his stated round,No longer now ador'd!—the host of stars,Shall they be deem'd his work? the rainbow too,That over arches the wide tracts of air,Is his the hand that bent it?—I am lostIn doubt and wonder!—Spaniard mark my words:If such the virtues which your God inspiresWe'll learn of thee to live. And oh! will learnThou murdered excellence! of thee to die.—Carlos.Enlighten'd hence, ye rulers of each stateLearn to extinguish fierce religious hate;Truth came reveal'd from the eternal mind,To bid us love, and not destroy mankind.Not blast the work, which heav'n with pleasure owns,Hear, bigot kings! and tremble on your thrones.FINIS.EPILOGUE.Spoken by Mrs. HARTLEY.OUR Play thus o'er, now swells each throbbing breastWith expectation of the coming jest.By FASHION's law, whene'er the TRAGIC MUSEWith sympathetic tears each eye bedews;When some BRIGHT VIRTUE at her call appears,Wak'd from the dead repose of rolling years,When SACRED WORTHIES she bids breathe anew,That men may be,—what she displays to view;By FASHION'S LAW, with light fantastic mienThe COMIC SISTER trips it o'er the scene;Arm'd at all points with wit and wanton wiles,Plays off her airs, and calls forth all her smiles;Till each fine feeling of the heart be o'er,And the gay wonder how they wept before.Say, do you wish, ye bright, ye virtuous train,That ev'ry tear that fell, should fall in vain?If this night's scenes soft pity could impart,Tis yours to fix the fashion of the heart.Adopt, ye fair, the lost Alzuma's cause,His ruin'd empire, and expiring laws.For ORELLANA may I dare to plead?My faults will all your kind indulgence need.On you my hopes are fix'd:—One smile from youTo me is worth the treasures of PERU.The following DRAMATIC PIECES are written by ARTHUR MURPHY Esq and sold by T.
