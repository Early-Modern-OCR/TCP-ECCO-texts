ZENOBIA.ZENOBIA: A TRAGEDY.As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE.By the AUTHOR of the ORPHAN OF CHINA.LONDON: Printed for W. GRIFFIN, in Catharine-street, Strand.MDCCLXVIII.[P. 1 s. 6 d.TO Mrs. DANCER.MADAM,IN a country, where addresses of this nature have generally waited upon the Great, upon a Wealthy Merchant, a Rich Commissary, or some New Man from the Sugar-islands, it will appear as surprizing, to many, as, no doubt, it will to yourself, that a New Form of Dedication should now be introduced. For the trouble I am giving you it will, however, be unnecessary to make any further apology, when I observe that in France, where talents are honoured, it has been frequently the practice of the most cele∣brated wits to do justice to those, who, by their pro∣fession, are the very Organ of the Muses. A VOL∣TAIRE and a MARMONTEL have paid their compli∣ments to a CLAIRON: and why may not an English Author, inferior as he is, and ever must be, to writers of that class, rival at least their politeness, by addressing himself to Mrs. DANCER, one of the first Ornaments of the British Theatre?There are, indeed, I must confess it, some demands upon my gratitude on this occasion, which even now are struggling to call my attention another way. Mr. GARRICK, Madam, has a claim to all the hand∣some things that can be said of him. His politeness from the moment he saw the play, his assiduity in preparing it for representation, the taste with which he has decorated it, and the warmth of his zeal for the honour of the piece, are circumstances that call upon me for the strongest acknowledgements. I

could employ my pen with pleasure in thanking Mr. BARRY for the very fine exertion of his powers, wherever the Poet gave the smallest opportunity. Mr. HOLLAND, who had before now given spirit to such scenes as mine, has renewed the obligation. I could add others to the list, but they, and even Mr. GARRICK at their head, must excuse me, if I turn to Mrs. DANCER, and say with Hamlet, "Here's mettle more attractive."ZENOBIA, Madam, is your own entirely. Where∣ever my inaccuracy has left imperfections, they are so happily varnished over by your skill, that either they are not seen, or you extort forgiveness for them: and if the Author is any where happy enough to snatch a grace beyond his usual reach, it is multi∣plied by your address into a number of beauties, like the SWORD in Tasso's Jerusalem, which, when bran∣dished by the hand of Rinaldo, appears to the whole army to be THREE SWORDS.The fate of ZENOBIA has been very extraordinary. She was saved in her life-time from the waters of the Araxes by the hand of a shepherd, and now she is saved from the critics by Mrs. DANCER.In testimony of the fact, the play, Madam, is now inscribed to you by him, who admires your talents, and remainsYour most obedient Servant, THE AUTHOR.March 3, 1768.PROLOGUE:Spoken by Mr. HOLLAND.OF old,—when Greece in a declining ageOf lawless pow'r had felt the barb'rous rage.This was the tyrant's art:—He gave a prizeTo him, who a new pleasure should devise.Ye tyrants of the Pit, whose cold disdainRejects and nauseates the repeated strain:Who call for rarities to quicken sense,Say, do you always the reward dispense?Ye bards,—to whom French wit gives kind relief,Are ye not oft the first—to cry STOP THIEF!Say,—to a brother do you e're allowOne little sprig, one leaf to deck his brow?No;—fierce invective stuns the play-wright's ears.Wits, Poets corner, Ledgers, Gazetteers?'Tis said, the Tartar,—e're he pierce the heart,Inscribes his name upon his poison'd dart.That scheme's rejected by each scribbling spark;—Our Christian system—stabs you in the dark.And yet the desp'rate author of to-nightDares on the muses wing another flight;Once more a dupe to fame forsakes his ease,And feels th' ambition—here again to please.He brings a tale from a far distant age,Enobled by the grave historic page!Tacitus Ann. Lib. 12. Sect. 44, to end of 5.Zenobia's woes have touch'd each polish'd state;The brightest eyes of France have mourn'd her fate.Harmonious Italy her tribute paid,And sung a dirge to her lamented shade.Yet think not that we mean to mock the eyeWith pilfer'd colours of a foreign dye.NOT to translate our bard his pen doth dip;He takes a play, as Britons take a ship;They heave her down;—with many a sturdy stroke,Repair her well, and build with Heart of Oak.To ev'ry breeze set Britain's streamers free,NEW-MAN her, and away again to sea.This is our author's aim;—and if his artWaken to sentiment the feeling heart;If in hit scenes alternate passions burn,And friendship, love, guilt, virtue take their turn;If innocence oppress'd lie bleeding here.You'll give—'tis all he asks—one VIRTUOUS TEAR.Dramatis Personae.PHARASMANES, Mr. AICKIN.RHADAMISTUS, Mr. BARRY.TERIBAZUS, Mr. HOLLAND.ZOPIRON, Mr. PACKER.TIGRANES, Mr. HURST.MEGISTUS, Mr. HAVARD.ZENOBIA, Mr. DANCER,ZELMIRA, Mrs. BARRY.Attendants, Guards, &c.SCENE lies in Pharasmanes' Camp, on the Banks of the Araxes.ZENOBIA.ACT the FIRST.ZELMIRA.THRO' the wide camp 'tis awful solitude!On ev'ry tent, which at the morning's dawnRung with the din of arms, deep silence sitsAdding new terrors to the dreadful scene!My heart dies in me!—hark!—with hideous roarThe turbulent Araxes foams along,And rolls his torrent thro' yon depth of woods!'Tis terrible to hear!—who's there?—Zopiron!Enter ZOPIRON.ZELMIRA.My lord; my Husband!—help me; lend your aid!ZOPIRON.Why didst thou leave thy tent?—why thus afflictThy anxious breast, thou partner of my heart?Why wilt thou thus distract thy tender natureWith groundless fears—er'e yonder sun shall visitThe western sky, all will be hush'd to peace.ZELMIRA.The interval is horrid; big with woe,With consternation, peril and dismay!And oh! if here, while yet the fate of nationsSuspended hangs upon the doubtful sword,If here the trembling heart thus shrink with horror,
Here in these tents, in this unpeopled camp,Oh! think, Zopiron, in yon field of deathWhere number soon in purple heaps shall bleed,What feelings there must throb in ev'ry breast?How long, ambition, wilt thou stalk the earthAnd thus lay waste-mankind!—ZOPIRON.This day at lengthThe warlike king, victorious PharasmanesCloses the scene of war.—The Roman bandsBut ill can cope with the embattled numbersAsia pours forth, a firm undaunted host!A nation under arms!—and every bosomTo deeds of glory fir'd!—Iberia then—ZELMIRA.Perish Iberia!—may the sons of RomePour rapid vengeance on her falling ranks,That he, who tramples on the rights of nature,May see his vassals over-whelm'd in ruin,May from yon field be led in sullen chains,To grace the triumph of imperial Rome,And from th' assembled senate humbly learnThe dictates of humanity and justice!ZOPIRON.Thy generous zeal, thy ev'ry sentimentCharms my delighted soul.—But thou be cautious,And check the rising ardor that inflames thee.The tyrant spares nor sex, nor innocence—ZELMIRA.Indignant of controul, he spurns each law,Each holy sanction, that restrains the nations,And forms 'twixt man and man the bond of peace.ZOPIRON.This is the tryger's den; with human goreFor ever floats the pavement; with the shrieksOf matrons weeping o'er their slaughter'd sons,The cries of virgins to the brutal armsOf violation dragg'd, with ceaseless groans
Of varied misery for ever ringsThe dreary region of his curs'd domain.ZELMIRA.To multiply his crimes, a beauteous captive,Th' afflicted Ariana—she—for her,For that fair excellence my bosom bleeds!She, in the prime of ev'ry blooming grace,When next the glowing hour of riot comes,Shall fall a victim to his base desires—ZOPIRON.The bounteous gods may succour virtue still!In this day's battle, which perhaps e're nowThe charging hosts have join'd, should Roman valourPrevail o'er Asia's numbers.—ZELMIRA.That eventIs all our hope.—And lo! on yonder rampartTrembling with wild anxiety she stands,Invokes each god, and bids her straining eyeExplore the distant field.—ZOPIRON.Yes, there she's fix'dA statue of dispair!—That tender bosomHeaves with no common grief—I've mark'd her oft,And if I read aright, some mighty causeOf hoarded anguish, some peculiar woePreys on her mind unseen!—But, ha! behold,She faints;—her fears too pow'rful for her frameSink that frail beauty drooping to the earth.Exit hastily.ZELMIRA.Haste, fly, Zopiron, fly with instant succour;Support her; help her;—Lo! th' attendant trainHave caught her in their arms!—assist her Heav'n,Assuage the sorrows of that gentle spirit!Her flutt'ring sense returns;—and now this wayThe virgins lead her.—May the avenging god!In pity of the woes such virtue feels,
In pity of the wrongs a world endures,With pow'r resistless arm the Roman legions,That they may hurl in one collected blowAssur'd destruction on the tyrant's head!—Enter ZENOBIA, leaning on two attendants.ZENOBIA.A little onward, still a little onwardSupport my steps—ZELMIRA.How fares it, madam, now?ZENOBIA.My strength returns—I thank ye, gen'rous maids,And would I could requite you—fruitless thanksAre all a wretch can give.—First attendant.The gentle officeOf mild benevolence our nature prompts—Your merit too commands:—on ArianaWe tend with willing, with delighted care,And that delight o'er pays us for our trouble.ZENOBIA.Your cares for me denote a heart that feelsFor other's woes.—Methinks with strength renew'dI could adventure forth again.—Second attendant.'T were bestRepose your wearied spirits—we will seekYon rising ground, and bring the swiftest tidingsOf all the mingled tumult.ZENOBIA.Go, my virgins;Watch well each movement of the marshall'd field;Each turn of fortune;—let me know it all;—Each varying circumstance—
ZENOBIA, ZELMIRA.ZELMIRA.And will you thus,Be doom'd for ever, Ariana, thusA willing prey to visionary ills,The self-consuming votarist of care?ZENOBIA.Alas! I'm doom'd to weep—the wrath of heav'nWith inexhausted vengeance follows still,And each day comes with aggravated woes.ZELMIRA.Yet when Iberia's king, when Pharasmanes,With all a lover's fondness—ZENOBIA.Name him not!Name not a monster horrible with blood,The widows, orphans, and the virgin's tears!ZELMIRA.Yet savage as he is, at sight of theeEach fiercer passion soften into love.To you he bends; the monarch of the eastDejected droops beneath your cold disdain.And all the tyranny of female pride.ZENOBIA.That pride is virtue;—virtue that abhorsThe tyrant reeking from a brother's murder!Oh! Mithridates! ever honour'd shade!—Peaceful he reign'd, dispensing good around him,In the mild eve of honourable days!—Thro' all her peopled realm Armenia feltHis equal sway;—the sunset of his pow'rWith fainter beams, but undiminish'd glory,Still shone serene, while ev'ry conscious subjectWith tears of praise beheld his calm declineAnd bless'd the parting ray!—yet then, Zelmira,Oh! fact accurs'd!—yes Pharasmanes then,
Detested perfidy!—nor ties of blood,Nor sacred laws, nor the just gods restrain him;—In the dead midnight hour the fell assassinRush'd on the slumber of the virtuous man;—His life blood gush'd;—the venerable kingWak'd, saw a brother arm'd against his life,—Forgave him and expir'd!ZELMIRA.Yet wherefore openAfresh the wounds, which time long since hath clos'd?—This day confirms his sceptre in his hand.ZENOBIA.Confirms his sceptre!—his!—indignant gods,Will no red vengeance from your stores of wrathBurst down to crush the tyrant in his guilt?His sceptre, saidst thou?—urge that word no more—The sceptre of his son!—the solemn rightOf Rhadamistus!—Mithridates choice,That call'd him to his daughter's nuptial bed,Approv'd him lineal heir;—consenting nobles,The public will, the sanction of the Laws,All ratified his claim;—yet curs'd ambition,Deaf to a nation's voice, a nation's charter,Nor satisfied to fill Iberia's throne,Made war, unnatural war, against a son,Usurp'd his crown, and with remorseless ragePursued his life.ZELMIRA.Can Arians pleadFor such a son?—means she to varnish o'erThe guilt of Rhadamistus?ZENOBIA.Guilt, Zelmira!ZELMIRA.Guilt that shoots horror thro' my aching heart!—Poor lost Zenobia!ZENOBIA.And do her misfortunesAwaken tender pity in your breast?ZELMIRA.Ill-fated princess! in her vernal bloomBy a false husband murder'd!—from the stemA Rose-bud torn, and in some desert caveThrown by to moulder into silent dust!—ZENOBIA.You knew not Rhadamistus!—PharasmanesKnew not the early virtues of his son.As yet an infant, in his tend' rest yearsHis father sent him to Armenia's court,That Mithridates' care might form his mindTo arts, to wisdom, and to manners worthyArmenia's sceptre, and Zenobia's love.The world delighted saw each dawning virtue,Each nameless grace to full perfection rising!—Oh! he was all the fondest maid could wish,All truth, all honour, tenderness and love!Yet from his empire thrown! with merciless furyHis father following,—slaughter raging round,What could the hero in that dire extreme?ZELMIRA.Those strong impassion'd looks!—some fatal secretWorks in her heart, and melts her into tears.Aside.ZENOBIA.Driv'n to the margin of Araxe's flood,—No means of flight,—aghast he look'd around,—Wild throbb'd his bosom with conflicting passions,—And must I then?—tears gush'd and choak'd his voice,——And must I leave thee then Zenobia?—mustThy beauteous form—he paus'd, then aim'd a poniardAt his great heart—but oh! I rush'd upon him,And with these arms close-wreathing round his neck,With all the vehemence of pray'rs and shrieks,Implor'd the only boon he then could grantTo perish with him in a fond embrace.—The foe drew near—time press'd,—no way was left—
He clasp'd me to his heart—together both,Lock'd in the folds of love, we plung'd at once,And sought a requiem in the roaring flood.ZELMIRA.—This wondrous tale!—this sudden burst of passion—ZENOBIA.Ha!—whither has my phrenzy led me?—hark!—That sound of triumph!—lost, for ever lost!Ruin'd Armenia!—oh! devoted race!A flourish of trumpets,Enter TIGRANES, Soldiers, and some Prisoners.ZENOBIA.Thy looks, Tigranes, indicate thy purpose!The armies met, and Pharasmanes conquer'd;Is it not so?TIGRANES.As yet with pent-up furyThe soldier pants to let destruction loose,With eager speed we urg'd our rapid march,To where the Romans tented in the valeWith cold delay protract the ling'ring war.At our approach their scanty numbers formTheir feeble lines, the future prey of vengeance.ZENOBIA.And wherefore, when thy sword demands its shareOf havoc in that scene of blood and horror,Wherefore return'st thou to this lonely camp?TIGRANES.With cautious eye as I explor'd the Forest,Which rises thick near yonder ridge of mountains,And stretches o'er th' interminable plain,I saw these captives in the gloomy woodSeeking with silent march the Roman camp.Impal'd alive 'tis Pharasmanes' willThey suffer death in misery of torment.ZENOBIA.Unhappy men!—and must they—ha!—that face,That aged mien!—that venerable form!—Immortal pow'rs!—is it my more than father?——Is that Megistus?—MEGISTUS.Ariana here!Gods! could I ever hope to see her more?Thou virtuous maid!—thou darling of my age!—ZENOBIA.It is—it is Megistus!—once againThus let me fall and clasp his rev'rend knee,Print the warm kiss of gratitude and loveUpon this trembling hand, and pour the tears,The mingled tears of wonder and of joy.—MEGISTUS.Rise, Ariana, rise—allmighty gods!The tide of joy and transport pours too fastAlong these wither'd veins—it is too muchFor a poor weak old man, worn out with griefAnd palsied age,—it is too much to bear!Oh! Ariana,—daughter of affliction,Have I then found thee?—do I thus behold thee!—Now I can die content!—ZENOBIA.Thou best of men!These joys our tears and looks can only speak.—MEGISTUS.Yet they are cruel joys—mysterious heav'n!You bid the storm o'ercast our darksome ways;You gild the cloud with gleams of cheering light;Then comes a breath from you, and all is vanish'd!ZENOBIA.Wherefore dejected thus—MEGISTUS.Alas! to meet thee
But for a moment, and then part for ever!To meet thee here, only to grieve thee more,To add to thy afflictions,—wound that bosomWhere mild affection,—where each virtue dwells,Just to behold thee, and then close my eyesIn endless night, while you survey my pangsIn the approaching agony of torment—ZENOBIA.Talk not of agony;—'tis rapture all!And who has pow'r to tear thee from my heart?MEGISTUS.Alas! the charge of vile imputed guilt—ZENOBIA.I know thy truth, thy pure exalted mind—Thy sense of noble deeds—imputed guilt!—Oh! none will dare—hast thou Tigranes?—what,What is his crime?—blush, foul traducer, blush!—Oh! (to Megistus) the wide world must own thy ev'ry virtue—TIGRANES.If in the conscious forest I beheldTheir dark complottings—ZENOBIA.Peace, vile sland'rer, peace!—Thou know'st who captivates a monarch's heart—'Tis I protect him—Ariana does it!—Thou, venerable man! in my pavillionI'll lodge thee safe from danger—oh! this joy,This best supreme delight the gods have sent,In pity for whole years of countless woe.Exit with Megistus.ZELMIRA, TIGRANES.TIGRANES.With what wild fury her conflicting passionsRise to a storm, a tempest of the soul!
I know the latent cause—her heart revolts,And leagues in secret with the Roman arms.ZELMIRA.Beware Tigranes!—that excess of joy,Those quick, those varied passions strongly speakThe stranger has an int'rest in her heart.Besides, thou know'st o'er Pharasmanes' willShe holds supreme dominion—TIGRANES.True, she rules himWith boundless sway—ZELMIRA.Nay, more to wake thy fears—The youthful prince, the valiant TeribazusIn secret sighs, and feels the ray of beautyThrough ev'ry sense soft-thrilling to his heart.He too becomes thy foe.—TIGRANES.Unguarded man!Whate'er he loves or hates, with gen'rous warmth,As nature prompts, that dares he to avow,And lets each passion stand confess'd to view;Such too is Ariana;—bold and openShe kindly gives instructions to her foe,To mar her best designs.—ZELMIRA.Her foe Tigranes!That lovely form inshrines the gentlest virtues,Softest compassion, unaffected wisdom,To outward beauty lending higher charmsAdorning and adorn'd!—The gen'rous prince,—He too—full well thou know'st him—he unitesIn the heroic mould of manly firmness,Each mild attractive art—oh! surely noneEnvy the fair renown that's earn'd by virtue.TIGRANES.None should Zelmira!—ha! those warlike notes!Enter TERIBAZUS.TERIBAZUS.Each weary soldier rest upon his arms,And wait the king's return—Zelmira say,In these dark moments of impending horrorHow fares thy beauteous friend?—her tender spiritBut ill supports the fierce alarms of war.Enter ZENOBIA.ZENOBIA.Where is he?—let me fly—oh! Pharasmanes—Methought those sounds bespoke the king's approach—Oh! Teribazus, tell me—have the fates—This horrible suspense—TERIBAZUS.I came, bright maid,To hush the wild emotions of thy heart.Devouring slaughter for a while suspendsIt's ruthless rage;—as either host advanc'dIn dread array, and from the burnish'd armsOf Asia's ranks redoubled sunbeams play'dBurning with bright diversities of day,Came forth an herald from the Roman campWith proferr'd terms—my father deign'd for onceTo yield to mild persuasion—in his tentTh' ambassador of Rome will soon attend himTo sheathe the sword, and give the nations peace.ZENOBIA.But oh! no peace for me, misfortune's heir!The wretched heir of misery!—But nowA more than father found,—yet cruel menWould tear him from me—gen'rous, gen'rous prince,Sparean old man, whose head is white with age,Nor let 'em wound me with the sharpest pangThat ever tortur'd a poor bleeding heart.TERIBAZUS.Arise my fair;—let not a storm of griefThus bend to earth my Ariana's beauties;Soon shall they all revive—ZENOBIA.They brought him fetter'd,Bound like a murderer!—Tigranes,—he,—This is the author of the horrid charge—He threatens instant death—but oh! protect,Protect an innocent, a good old man,—Or stretch me with him on the mournful bier.TERIBAZUS.By heav'n, whoe'er he is, since dear to you,He shall not suffer—quick, direct me to him—My guards shall safe inclose him.ZENOBIA.In my pavillion He waits his doom—TERIBAZUS.Myself will bear the tidingsOf life, of joy, and liberty restor'd.—And thou artificer of ill, thou false,Thou vile defamer!—leave thy treach'rous arts,Nor dare accuse whom Ariana loves.ZENOBIA, ZELMIRA.ZENOBIA.Zelmira,—this is happiness supreme!Oh! to have met with unexampl'd goodnessTo owe my all, my very life itself,To an unknown but hospitable hand,And thus enabled by the bounteous gods,To pay the vast, vast debt—'tis ecstacy
That swells above all bounds, till the fond heartAke with delight, and thus run o'er in tears.ZELMIRA.What must Zelmira think?—at first your tongueGrew lavish in the praise of Rhadamistus,With hints obscure touching your high descent;—And now this hoary sage—is he your father?My mind is lost in wonder and in doubt.—ZENOBIA.Then to dispel thy doubts, and tell at onceWhat deep reserve has hid within my heart,—I am Zenobia—I that ill-starr'd wretch!The daughter of a scepter'd ancestry,And now the slave of Mithridates' brother!ZELMIRA.Long lost Zenobia, and restor'd at length!I am your subject; oh! my queen! my sov'reign!ZENOBIA.Thou gen'rous friend! Rise, my Zelmira, rise.—That good old man!—oh! it was he beheld meBorne far away from Rhadamistus' arms,Just perishing, just lost!—He dash'd into the flood, redeem'd me thence,And brought be back to life.—My op'ning eyesJust saw the light, and clos'd again to shun it.Each vital pow'r was sunk, but he, well skill'dIn potent herbs, recall'd by flutt'ring soul.ZELMIRA.May the propitious gods reward his care.ZENOBIA.With me he sav'd a dear, a precious boy,Then in the womb conceal'd;—he sav'd my childTo trace his father's lov'd resemblance to me,The dear, dear offspring of our bridal loves.ZELMIRA.Oh! blessings on him, blessings on his head!—ZENOBIA.Resign'd and patient I since dwelt with him—Far in the mazes of a winding wood,Midst hoary mountains, and deep cavern'd rocks.But oh! the fond idea of my lordPursued me still, or in the cavern'd rock,The mountain's brow, and pendent forest's gloom.The sun look'd joyless down;—each' lonely nightHeard my griefs ecchoing thro' the woodland shade.—My infant Rhadamistus!—he is lost,He too is wrested from me!—'midst the rageAnd the wide waste of war, the hell-hound troopsOf Pharasmanes sought my lone retreat,And from the violated shades, from allMy soul held dear, the barb'rous ruffians tore me,And never shall the wretched mother seeHer child again!—ZELMIRA.Heav'n may restore him still,—May still restore your royal husband too—Who knows but some protecting god—ZENOBIA.No god!No guardian pow'r was present!—he is lost!—Oh! Rhadamistus!—oh! my honour'd lord!No pitying eye beheld thy decent form;—The rolling flood devour'd thee!—thou hast foundA watry grave, and the last dismal accentsThat trembled on thy tongue, came bubbling up,And murmur'd lost Zenobia!ZELMIRA.Yet be calm.—The gods may bring redress—even now they giveTo misery like thine, the heartfelt joyOf shielding injured virtue.ZENOBIA.Yes, Zelmira,That pure delight is mine, a ray from heav'nThat bids affliction smile—All gracious pow'rs!Make me your agent here to save Megistus,I'll bear the load of life,—bear all it's illsTill you shall bid this sad world-weary spiritTo peaceful regions wing her happy flight,And seek my lord in the dark realms of Night;Seek his dear shade In ev'ry pensive grove,And bear him all my constancy and love.END OF THE FIRST ACT.ACT the SECOND.TIGRANES.A False accuser deem'd!—artificer of fraud!Those words, intemp'rate boy—thy phrenzy tooDeluded fair!—shall cost you dear atonement.Yet till occasion rise—the king approaches.Grand warlike music.A Military Procession: Enter Pharasmanes, &c.PHARASMANES.At length the same of Pharasmanes' armsHath aw'd the Nations round—Rome shrinks aghastWith pale dismay, recalls her trembling legions,And deprecates the war—oh! what a sceneOf glorious havoc had yon field beheld,If peaceful counsels had not check'd my fury!—Valiant Tigranes, those rebellious slaves,Thy care detected,—have they suffer'd death?TIGRANES.Your pardon, Sir—their doom as yet suspended—The gen'rous prince—I would not utter aughtShould injure Teribazus—PHARASMANES.Ha!—proceed,And give me all the truth—TIGRANES.By his command—His tender nature deem'd it barb'rous rigourTo urge their sentence—PHARASMANES.Vain aspiring boy!Tell Teribazus,[Enter Zenobia]—tell th' unthinking prince,
The rash presumptuous stripling, these his arts,These practices of popular demeanour,Are treason to his father—let him knowThro' wide Armenia and Iberia's realmMy will is fate—the slaves shall meet their doom.ZENOBIA.Oh! mighty king,—thus bending lowly down,—An humble suppliant—PHARASMANES.Ariana here!Thou beauteous mourner, let no care molestThy tender bosom;—rise and bid thy charmsBeam forth their gentlest lustre to adornThe glories of my triumph.ZENOBIA.Oh! a wretch like meIt best befits thus groveling on the earthTo bathe your feet with tears—PHARASMANES.It must not be—He raises her.By heav'n renown in arms in vain attends me,If the lov'd graces of thy matchless formAre thus depress'd and languish in affliction,Like flow'rs that droop and hang their pining headsBeneath the rigour of relentless skies.ZENOBIA.If thou would'st raise me from the depths of woe,Forgive those captives, whom thy fatal angerAdjudg'd to death, nor let ill-tim'd resentmentFall on the prince your son—'twas I—my tears—My piercing lamentations won his heartTo arrest their doom—PHARASMANES.For traitors to my crownDoes Ariana plead?—ZENOBIA.For mild humanityMy suppliant voice is rais'd—I point the meansTo add new glory to your fame in arms.In naught so near can men approach the godsAs the dear act of giving life to others.—In feats of war the glory is divided,To all imparted,—to each common man,—And fortune too shall vindicate her share.——But of sweet mercy,—the vast, vast renownIs all your own; nor officer, nor soldierCan claim a part—the praise, the honour'd praise,Adorns the victor,—nor is th' eccho lost'Midst shouts of armies, and the trumpet's sound.He conquers even victory itself,Than hero more—a blessing to the world!—PHARASMANES.Thy eloquence disarms my stubborn soul.But wherefore urgent thus?—amidst the bandIs there who claims thy soft solicitude?ZENOBIA.A hoary sage—alas! a more than father—The best of men!—preserver of my being,—A blameless shepherd!—rude of fraud and guilt,Innoxious thro' his life'—oh! mighty king,Spare an old man,—a venerable sire!Naught has your fortune greater than the pow'rTo serve humanity!—shew that your heartHas the sweet grace, the gen'rous virtue too!PHARASMANES.My soul relents, and yields to thy entreaty,Thy violence of pray'r—release him streight—My brightest honours wait him;—honours fitFor him who gave thee birth;—for him whose virtueThy gen'rous soul deems worthy it's esteem.ZENOBIA.Our humble station seeks nor pomp nor splendor—We only ask, unenvied and obscure,To live in blameless innocence,—to seek
Our calm retreat, embrac'd in depth of woods,And dwell with peace and humble virtue there.PHARASMANES.That coy disdain, which shuns admiring eyes,Attracts the more, exalting ev'ry charm.No more of humble birth—thy matchless beauty,Like gems, that in the mine conceal their lustre,Was form'd to dignify the eastern throne.My sceptre, that strikes terror to each heart,Grac'd by thy decent hand shall make each subjectAdore thy softer sway—The glorious aeraOf Pharasmanes' love,—his date of empireWith Ariana shar'd, henceforth begins,And leads the laughing hours—but first the stormOf war and wild commotion must be hush'd—That mighty care now calls me to my throne,To give the Roman audience; audience fitTo strike a citizen of Rome with awe,When he beholds the majesty of kings.going.Enter TERIBAZUS.TERIBAZUS.Dread Sir, the Roman embassy approaches.—From yonder rampart, that invests your camp,I heard their horses hoofs with eager speedBeat the resounding soil.—PHARASMANES.Let 'em approach—And thou, whose arrogance—but I forbear—When Ariana pardons, my resentmentYields to her smile, and looks away it's rage.As when the crimes of men Jove's wrath demand,And the red thunder quivers in his hand;The queen of love his vengeance can disarmWith the soft eloquence of ev'ry charm;Controul his passions with resistless sway,And the impending storm smile to serenest day.Exit with his train.
ZENOBIA, TERIBAZUS.TERIBAZUS.And may I then once more, thou bright perfection,May Teribazus once again approach thee,While thus my father,—my ambitious father,At sight of thee forgets his cruel nature,And wonders how he feels thy beauty's pow'r?Oh! may I—but I'm too importunate—Your looks rebuke me from you,—and I seeHow hateful I am grown!—ZENOBIA.Mistake me not,Nor rashly thus arraign the looks of one,Whose heart lies bleeding here—thy gen'rous worthIs oft the live-long day my fav'rite theme.But oh! for me,—for wretched Ariana,The god of love long since hath quench'd his torch,And ev'ry source of joy lies dead within me.TERIBAZUS.That cold averted look!—but I am us'dTo bear your scorn;—your scorn that wounds the deeper,Mask'd as it is with pity and esteem.Yet love incurable,—relentless loveBurns here a constant flame, that rises stillAnd will to madness kindle, should I seeThat hoard of sweets, that treasury of charmsYield to another, to a barb'rous rivalWho persecutes a son to his undoing.ZENOBIA.If Ariana's happiness would wound thee,Thou'lt ne'er have cause to murmur or repine.Naught can divorce me from the black despairTo which I've long been wedded.—TERIBAZUS.Calm disdain,I grant you, well becomes the tyrant fairWhom Pharasmanes destines for his throne.But oh! in pity to this breaking heart,
Give me, in mercy give some other rival,Whom I may stab,—without remorse may stab,Midst his delight, in all his heav'n of bliss,And spurn him from the joys, that scorpion-likeShoot anguish here—here thro' my very soul.ZENOBIA.Alas! too gen'rous prince, the gods long sinceBetween us both fix'd their eternal bar.TEREBAZUS.What say'st thou Ariana?—ha! beware,Nor urge me to destraction—Love like mine,Fierce, gener'ous, wild,—with disappointment wild,May rouze my desp'rate rage to do a deedWill make all nature shudder.—Love despis'dNot always can respect the ties of nature!——Driven to extremes the tend'rest passion scorn'dMay hate at length the object it adores,And stung to madness—no!—inhuman fair,You still must be,—in all vicissitudes,In all the scenes misfortune has in store,You still must be the sov'reign of my soul.But for the favour'd, for the happy rival,By heav'n, who e'er he be,—despair and phrenzyMay strike the blow, and dash him from your armsA sacrifice to violated love.ZENOBIA,Why thus distract yourself with vain suspicions?— You have no rival, whom your rage can murder ——None in the pow'r of fate—oh! Teribazus,The wretched Ariana—long, long since——My heart swells o'er—I cannot speak—a duty,A rigorous duty bids me ne'er acceptThy proferr'd love;—a duty, which, if known,Would in eternal silence seal thy vows,Turn all thy rage to tears, and, oh! my prince!Bid thee respect calamities like mine.Exit.TERIBAZUS.Yet Ariana stay—turn, turn and hear me—She's gone, the cruel, unrelenting fair!
And leaves me thus to misery of soul.Enter ZOPIRON.Flamminius, from the Romans is arriv'd,And bears the olive-branch—the king your fatherAssembles all his nobles—TERIBAZUS.Say, Zopiron,Does Rome yield up Armenia?ZOPIRON.Rome is stillThe scourge of lawless pow'r—a people's rightsThe conscript fathers have resolv'd to shield,And to the lineal heir assert the crown.TERIBAZUS.May the stern god of battles aid their arms,And fight with the deliverers of mankind!Unnatural father! that would seize my sceptre,Mine as my brother's heir, and ravish with itThe idol of my soul—but now no moreHis tyranny prevails—to empire rais'd,'Twill be the pride of my exulting heart.To lay my crown at Ariana's feet.Exit.ZOPIRON.Unhappy prince! should Pharasmanes knowHis ardent passion for the captive maid,Alas! his fatal rage—propitious pow'rs!May these events,—may Rome's ambassador,—Oh! may he come with concord in his train,And far avert the ills my heart forebodes!—But lo! Flamminius.—Enter RHADAMISTUS,ZOPIRON.Welcome to these tentsThe harbinger of peace!RHADAMISTUS.Does your king knowFlamminius waits his leisure!ZOPIRON.He preparesTo hear you, Roman!—RHADAMISTUS.As I tread his campThere is I know not what of horror shootsThro' all my frame, and disconcerted reasonSuspends her function,—a black train of crime,Murders, and lust, and rapine, cities sack'd,Nations laid waste by the destructive sword,A thousand ruthless deeds all rise to view,And shake my inmost soul, as I approachThe author of calamity and ruin.ZOPIRON.Then from a Roman, from a son of freedomLet the fell tyrant hear the voice of truth,The strong resistless strain, which libertyBreathes in her capitol, till his proud heartShudder with inward horror at itself.RHADAMISTUS.In Pharasmanes camp that honest stile!—Thy visage bears the characters of virtue.—Wilt thou impart thy name and quality?ZOPIRON,In me you see Zopiron!—deem me notA vile abettor of the tyrant's guilt.—To me Armenia trusts her sacred rights;Hither her chosen deligate she sends me,At the tribunal of Iberia's king,To plead her cause, an injur'd people's cause!Oh! never, never shall my native landYield to a vile usurper.RHADAMISTUS.Rome has heardThy patriot toil for freedom—RhadamistusHas heard thy gen'rous ardour in his cause,And pants to recompence thy truth and zeal.ZOPIRON.Oh! name not Rhadamistus—now no moreThe god-like youth shall bless Armenia's realm.The fates just shew'd him to the wond'ring world,And then untimely snatch'd him from our sight!—RHADAMISTUS.And didst thou know the prince?ZOPIRON.My lot severeDenied that transport;—but the voice of fameEndears his memory.RHADAMISTUS.A time may comeWhen you may meet, and both in friendship burn.—Still Rhadamistus lives!—ZOPIRON.Said'st thou Flamminius!—Lives he?RHADAMISTUS.Still he survives;—from death and perilSav'd by a miracle!—and now for himRome claims Armenia.—ZOPIRON.Claims Armenia for him!—For Rhadamistus claims!—and will ye, god!Still will ye give him to a nation's pray'rs:RHADAMISTUS.Alas! he lives;—heart-broken, desolate,In sorrow plung'd,—abandon'd to despair!—ZOPIRON.The righteous gods will vindicate his cause.—His lov'd Zenobia, Mithridates' daughter,That ev'ry excellence—does she too live?
Have the indulgent pow'rs watch'd o'er her fate,And sav'd her for her people?—RHADAMISTUS.There, Zopiron,There lies the wound that pierces to his soul,The sharpest pang,—that rends,—that cleaves his heart.—Oh! never more shall lovely lost Zenobia,That angel form,—that pattern of all goodness,No, never more—she's gone, for ever gone!Thou wouldst not think—her barb'rous, cruel husband—With his own hand—the recollected taleOf horror shakes my frame to dissolution!—Her husband!—he!—that dear, that tender form—Oh!—poor Zenobia—oh!—Falls into swoon.ZOPIRON.He faints;—he falls!—Can Roman stoicism thus dissolveIn tender pity?—rise, Flamminius, rise;He stirs; he breathes;—and life begins to wanderO'er his forsaken cheek.—Resume thy strength,And like a Roman triumph o'er your tears.—RHADAMISTUS.I'll not be forc'd back to a wretched world.—No;—let me,—let me die.—ZOPIRON.His eyes rejectThe cheerful light—what can this anguish mean?RHADAMISTUS.You do but waste your pains;—it is in vain!—Away and leave a murd'rer to his woes.—ZOPIRON.Why thus accuse thyself?—I'll not believe it—Thus let me raise thee from the earth—RHADAMISTUS.Alas!

Zopiron,—Here,—here it lies—ZOPIRON.Unburthen all, and easeYour loaded heart—it cannot be—thou never wertA murd'rer!—RHADAMISTUS.Yes!—the horror of the world!—A murd'rous wretch!—the fatal Rhadamistus!—'Twas I—these felon hands!—with treach'rous loveI clasp'd her in this curs'd embrace—I bore herIn these detested arms, and gave that beauty,That tender form to the devouring waves.—Plunge me, ye furies, in your lakes of fire—Here fix,—fix all your vultures in my heart!—And lo! they rush upon me (starts up) see! see there!With racks and wheels they come;—they tear me piece-meal—'Tis just Zenobia!—I deserve it all—Falls upon Zopiron.ZOPIRON.Assist him guardian pow'rs!—your own high willGuides these events!—revive, my prince, revive!RHADAMISTUS.Why thus recall me to despair and horror?To bid me hate the light, detest myself,Traitor to nature,—traitor to my love!—And yet, Zopiron,—yet I am not plung'dSo far in guilt, but thou may'st pity me!—Heav'n, I attest,—yes you can witness gods!I meant to perish with her—but the fatesDenied that comfort—from her circling armsThe torrent bore me far—expiring, senseless,Gasping in death, the overflowing tide
Impetuous drove me on th' unwish'd for shore.—There soon deserted by the merciless streamA band of Romans, as from Syria's frontierThey rang'd the country round,—descried me stretch'dPale and inanimate—with barb'rous pityThey lent their aid, and chain'd me to the rackOf inauspicious life!—ZOPIRON.For wond'rous endsMysterious providence has still reserv'd you,To circulate the happiness of millions,A patriot prince!—RHADAMISTUS.Would they had let me perish!—What has a wretch like me to do in life,When my Zenobia's lost?—'tis true, my friend,She begg'd to die—but that pathetic look,Her tears, embraces, and those streaming eyesStill beauteous in distress!—each winning grace,Her ev'ry charm should have forbid the deed,And pleaded for her life!ZOPIRON.And yet, my prince,When self-acquitting conscience—RHADAMISTUS.Self-condemn'dMy soul is rack'd,—is tortur'd—not her child,Her unborn infant,—the first fruit of love,Not ev'n her babe could with the voice of naturePlead for itself,—or for it's wretched mother.—They perish'd both,—she and her little one,And I survive to tell it.—ZOPIRON.Let not griefO'erwhelm your reason thus—what! when your father,Your cruel father, reeking from the bloodOf Mithridates—RHADAMISTUS.Naught but death was left,Yet ev'n that last, sad refuge was debarr'd me!—E'er since I've liv'd in misery;—my daysWere colour'd all with anguish and despair!Long from the Romans I conceal'd my name.At length reveal'd me to a chosen friend;——Journey'd with him to Rome; and in full senateTold all the dismal story of my woes.The conscript fathers heard, and dropt a tear—Then to quick vengeance fir'd, dispatch'd their legionsTo wage the war; Paulinus leads them on,And now to me commits this embassy,With fully delegated pow'rs from Rome.ZOPIRON.With one united voice Armenia callsFor Mithridates' heir!—convinc'd by rumourThat thou ar't lost, the gen'ral cry demandsYour brother Teribazus—RHADAMISTUS.He, Zopiron,Is to these eyes a stranger.—ZOPIRON.Hapless prince!A cloud of woes lies brooding o'er his head.A fair, a lovely captive rules his heart;Her name is Ariana; and indeedNo wonder she attracts his soft regard,And kindles all the vehemence of love.The tyrant eyes her too with fierce desire,—And ruin nods o'er Teribazus' head.RHADAMISTUS.By heav'n it shall not be—alas! I knowThe pang of losing whom the heart adores.—I'll yield him up Armenia—what are crownsBut toys of vain ambition, when the lov'dThe dear pertaker of my throne is lost?Enter TIGRANES.ZOPIRON.What would Tigranes?TIGRANES.Pharasmanes callsFlamminius to his presence—RHADAMISTUS.I attend him;—So tell your king—TIGRANES.Instant he waits thee Roman.Exit.RHADAMISTUS.How my heart trembles at the awful meeting!ZOPIRON.Then summon all your strength—the lapse of timeFrom early youth, when Pharasmanes saw you,Affliction's inward stroke,—that Roman garb,All will protect, and cloak you from detection!—RHADAMISTUS.Zopiron yes; in this important crisis,When violated laws, and injur'd men,When my own wrongs are lab'ring in my heart,The great occasion calls for firmest vigour.Yes, in this interview I will maintainA Roman's part;—in Pharasmanes' soulI'll wake the furies of detested guilt,And pour the rapid energy of truthTill ev'n to himself his crimes are known,And the usurper tremble on his throne.END OF THE SECOND ACT.ACT the THIRD.PHARASMANES, on his throne: TIGRANES, ZOPIRON, Officers, &c.PHARASMANES.WHERE is this bold republican from Rome?This enemy of kings?—Tigranes, thouBid the Plebeian enter—PharasmanesVouchsafes him audience.—Enter FLAMMINIUS.PHARASMANES.Now, Flamminius, sayWhat motive brings you to Araxes' banks,To wage this slow, this philosophic war?RHADAMISTUS.By me, unworthy of th' important charge,By me, unequal to the arduous theme,The conscript fathers here explain their conduct,And justify the ways of Rome to kings.PHARASMANES.Roman, thou may'st declaim with all thy pompOf idle eloquence.RHADAMISTUS.No pow'r of words,No graceful periods of harmonious speechDwell on my lip—the only art I boastIs honest truth, unpolish'd, unadorn'd!—Truth that must strike conviction to your heart,Truth that informs you,—to usurp a crown,For dire ambition to unpeople realms,Are violations of each sacred law,And bid the Roman eagle wing'd with vengeanceTo the Araxes' margin bend her flight,To tell destruction it shall rage no more.PHARASMANES.And dares Paulinus' soldier,—dar'st thou slaveThus offer vile indignity, and moutheThe language of your forum to a king?RHADAMISTUS.Rome knows, and owns you as Iberia's king,But not Armenia's.—PHARASMANES.Ha!—RHADAMISTUS.Th' assembled senateAcknowledges your vast renown in arms,And honours the unshaken fortitudeEv'n of a foe—but, Sir, the fortitude,Whose brutal rage lays nations desolate,It is the glory of imperial RomeTo humble and subdue—It is the gloryOf Rome, that spares the vanquish'd, 'tis her prideTo set the nations free;—to fix the boundsOf the fell tyrant's pow'r;—to trace the circleFrom which he must not move—these are the artsThe bright prerogative of Rome—of Rome,The mistress of the world, whose conqu'ring bannersO'er Asia's realms so oft have wav'd in triumph,And made ev'n kings her subjects—PHARASMANES.Ha! vain boaster!RHADAMISTUS.Made oriental kings, short by the kneeAccept their crown, with tears of joy accept it,And be the viceroys of a Roman senate.PHARASMANES.And this to Pharasmanes?—has not yetA train of conquests taught you to revereThis good right arm in war?—This arm the ParthiansHave felt with, fatal overthrow—no spoil,
No trophies won from me have grac'd their triumphs;No friends of mine were harness'd to their chariots;—No captive chief, like your own mangled Crassus,There roams a sullen ghost, and calls for vengeance,For vengeance still unpaid, and calls in vainFor the sad funeral rites:—Would Rome presumeTo wrest Armenia from me,—lo! my bannersFrom frosty Caucasus to Phasis' banksWave high in air, and shadow all the land.Call your embattled legions—or does Rome,All conqu'ring Rome, that mistress of the world,Does she at length by her ambassadorsNegotiate thus the war?RHADAMISTUS.Rome, Sir, commandsThe subject world, for she adores the gods—And their all pow'rful aid.—PHARASMANES.Wouldst thou disputeMy lawful claim,—arm thee with sword and fire;Not with vain subtleties, and idle maxims.—Armenia's crown is mine,—deriv'd to me,Heir to a brother, and a son deceas'd.—RHADAMISTUS.And can a murd'rer, can the midnight ruffianProve himself heir—by the assassin's stab?—PHARASMANES;Thou base reviler!—Comes forward and draws his fabre.TIGRANES.Moderate your fury;It were unjust—[holding him]ZOPIRON.The character he bears,—The laws of nations—PHARASMANES.Thou base insolent!
Who dar'st to wound the ear of sacred kingsWith a black crime, that's horrible to nature!—RHADAMISTUS.Yes horrible to nature!—yet the worldHas heard it all—Thou art the man of blood!A brother's blood yet smokes upon thy hand—Not his white age, his venerable looks,Not ev'n his godlike virtues could withhold thee!—Gash'd o'er with wounds he falls;—he bleeds, he dies,Without a groan he dies!—that is thy work,Thine, murd'rer, thine!—PHARASMANES.No more—the hand of heav'nShook from the blasted tree the wither'd fruit—RHADAMISTUS.Forbear the impious strain—it is the stileAmbition speaks, when for a crown it stabs,Then dares, with execrable mock'ry daresTraduce the governing all-righteous mind.PHARASMANES.He harrows up my soul!—and do'st thou thinkA mad man's ravings—RHADAMISTUS.Since that hour accurstHast thou not plung'd thee deeper still in guilt?Your son—your blameless son—PHARASMANES.His crimes provok'dA fathers wrath—his and Zenobia's crimes!—RHADAMISTUS.She too—untimely lost—unbidden tearsForbear to stream, nor quite unman me thus.PHARASMANES.In tears!—by heav'n; thou woman hearted slave,
Those coward symptoms have some latent springThat lies conceal'd within that treach'rous heart.RHADAMISTUS.They are the tears humanity lets fallWhen soft ey'd beauty dies untimely slain.—But to avenge her death, array'd in terrorThe Roman legions—PHARASMANES.Lead 'em to the charge.—Thou quit my camp:—If when yon sun descendsThou linger'st here, the title of ambassadorShall naught avail to save thee from my fury.RHADAMISTUS.E'er that resign Armenia—Till the closeOf day, I give thee leisure to revolveThe vengeance Rome prepares—Thou know'stWith what a pond'rous arm her hardy sonsLift the avenging spear.—Be timely wife,Nor dare provoke your fate.Exit.PHARASMANES.Roman farewel!—Do thou, Tigranes, issue forth my ordersFrom tent to tent, that each man stand prepar'dFor the dead midnight hour—with silent march,Then will I pour with ruinous assaultUpon th' astonish'd foe, my horses hoofs.Imbrue in blood, and give to-morrow's sunA spectacle of horror and destruction.—He ascends his throne, and the back scene clos;es.Enter ZENOBIA and MEGISTUS.ZENOBIA.Oh! tell me all Megistus; let me hearAll that concerns my child,—my blooming boy,My little Rhadamistus—is he safe?Give me the truth—do not deceive a motherWho doats Upon her babe—is my child safe?MEGISTUS.Dry up your tears—I cannot hear to see youAfflicted thus—your infant hero's safeYou may believe your faithful old Megistus—ZENOBIA.I do believe thee—but excuse my weakness—My flutt'ring fears for ever paint him to meBy ruffians seiz'd, and as he sees the knifeAim'd at his little throat, in vain imploringFor me by name, and begging my assistance,While far, far off his miserable motherNo aid can give, nor snatch him to her heart.MEGISTUS.I never yet deceiv'd you—by yon heav'nThe prince still lives—when I regain'd my cottageAfter the toils of many a weary day,I found him there—but griev'd and wond'ring muchWhere his dear mother was.ZENOBIA.Megistus tell me,Oh! tell me each particular; his looks.All his apt questions, his enchanting words;For I could hear of him for ever—lovely youth;His father's image blooming in his boy!Thro' sev'n revolving years my only comfort!—When from my eyes the sudden sorrows gush'd,How would he look, and ask his wretched motherWhat meant those falling tears?—alas! ev'n nowI see him here before me—did my childThink his poor mother lost?MEGISTUS.At first he seem'dTo pine in thought at your long weary absence,And many a look he cast, that plainly spokeHis little bosom heav'd with various passions.Still would he seek you in each well known haunt,Each bow'r, each cavern, like the tender fawnThat thro' the woodland seeks it's mother lost,
Exploring all around with anxious eye,And looking still unutterable grief,Lonely and sad, and stung with keen regret.ZENOBIA.Did my child weep?—not much I hope—MEGISTUS.With soothing talesI labour'd to beguile him from his sorrow;—I promis'd your return;—a gentle smileBrighten'd his anxious look; he sigh'd content,And then I led him to a safer dwellingAmong the shepherds of the Syrian vale,Who all have sworn to guard him as their own,And in due season lead him to the Romans.ZENOBIA.Oh! may those shepherds know the kindest influenceOf the indulgent heav'ns!—yet why not stayTo guard him—but i'll not complain—on meYour cares were fix'd—oh! tell me how the godsWatch'd ov'r all thy ways, and brought thee to me?Where hast thou liv'd these many, many days?—MEGISTUS.In bitterness of soul I've liv'd, thy fateThy ender form deep imag'd in my breast!I rang'd the banks where the Araxes flows,But bring, alas! no tidings of your lord.Heart-broken, wearied out, I measur'd backMy feeble steps,—but thou wer't ravish'd thence;—For thee I travers'd hills and forests drear;Thee I invok'd, that ey'ry cavern'd rock,Each vale, each mountain eccho'd with thy name.ZENOBIA.And here at length you find me, here encompass'dWith all the worst of ills—hence let us flyTo the bless'd Syrian vally, where my childWins with his early manhood ev'ry heart,And calls for me, and chides this long delay.MEGISTUS.Vain the attempt—one only way is left—Reveal thee to th' ambassador of Rome.—Safe in his train thou may'st escape this place,And gain Paulinus' camp—Zenobia knownWill meet protection there.—ZENOBIA.The gods inspireThe happy counsel—ha!— Tigranes comes!Retire Megistus (he goes out) a gay dawn of hopeBeams forth at length, and lights up day within me.ZENOBIA, TIGRANES.TIGRANES.Hail princess, destin'd to imperial sway,To grace with beauty Pharasmanes' throne!By me the impatient king requests you'll fixThe happy nuptial hour.—ZENOBIA.Thou might'st as wellCommand me wed the forked lightnings blazeThat gilds the storm, and be in love with horror.TIGRANES.Take heed, rash fair!—an eastern monarch's love,Ardent as his, must not be made the sportOf tyrant beauty—when a rival daresOppose his sov'reign's wish—ZENOBIA.Does Pharasmanes,Say,—does your king permit his spies of state,That curse of human kind, to breathe their whispersIn his deluded ear?TIGRANES.Full well 'tis knownThat Teribazus bids you thus revolt,And draws your heart's allegiance from your king.ZENOBIA.Thou vile accuser!—if the prince's virtuesHave touch'd my bosom, what hast thou to urge?—What if a former Hymeneal vowHas bound my soul?—what if a father, Sir,A father dear as my heart's purple drops,Enjoin a rigid duty ne'er to shareThe throne of Mithridates with a murderer?TIGRANES.Madam, those words—ZENOBIA.Thou instrument of ill!Who still ar't ready with a tale suborn'd,And if thou ar't not perjur'd, dar'st betray,—Away—and let thy conscience tell the rest.Exit.TIGRANES, alone.Vain haughty fair!—thou hast provok'd my rageBy wrongs unnumber'd—but for all those wrongsSoon shall inevitable ruin seize thee.—Enter RHADAMISTUS.RHADAMISTUS.Perhaps e're this your king's tumultuous passionsSink to a calm, and reason takes her turn.Then seek him, Sir, and bear a Roman's message,The terms of peace humanity suggests.Tell him Flamminius wishes to preventThe rage of slaughter, and the streams of bloodWhich else shall deluge yonder crimson plains.TIGRANES.Already, Roman, his resolve is fix'd.—War, horrid war impends,—RHADAMISTUS.And yet in pityTo human kind, to the unhappy millions
Who soon shall die, and with their scatter'd bonesWhiten the plains of Asia,—it were bestTo sheathe the sword, and join in Rome's alliance.Wilt thou convey my message?TIGRANES.I obey.—Exit.RHADAMISTUS. alone.May some propitious pow'r inspire his heart,And touch the springs of human kindness in him.Else against whom amidst the charging hostsMust Rhadamistus' sword be levell'd?—ha!—Spite of his crimes he is my father still—And must this arm against the source of life—Nay more,—perhaps against a brother too,—A brother still unknown!—he too may dieBy this unconscious hand!—this hand alreadyInur'd to murder whom my heart adores!—My brother then may bleed!—and when in deathGasping he lies, and pours his vital stream,Then in that moment shall the gen'rous youthExtend his arms, and with a piteous lookTell me—a brother doth forgive his murderer?——Gods! you have doom'd me to the blackest woe,To be a wretch abhorr'd, author of crimesFrom which my tortur'd breast revolts with horror!—Who's there?—a youth comes forward—now be firm,Be firm my heart,—and guard thy fatal secret!—Enter TERIBAZUS.TERIBAZUS.Illustrious Roman,—if misfortune's son,A wretched,—ruin'd,—miserable princeMay claim attention—RHADAMISTUS.Ha—can this be he!The graces of his youth,—each feeling here,Here at my heartstrings tell me 'tis my brother!aside.TERIBAZUS.I see you're mov'd, and I intrude too far.—RHADAMISTUS.Pursue your purpose—warmest friendship for youGlows in this breast—TERIBAZUS.Tho' Pharasmanes' furyMaintains a fix'd hostility with Rome,Blend not the son with all a father's crimes.—RHADAMISTUS.Go on—I pant to hear—TERIBAZUS.My father's crueltyEach day breaks out in some new act of horror,Nor lets the sword grow cool from human bloodFirst in his brother's breast he plung'd it;—thenInflam'd to fiercer rage 'gainst his own son,Oh! Rhadamistus! thou much injur'd prince!—RHADAMISTUS.And didst thou love that brother?TERIBAZUS.Gen'rous Roman,He liv'd far hence remote—I ne'er beheld him,But the wide world resounded with his fame.RHADAMISTUS.Hold, hold my tears! —oh! they will burst their wayAt this his virtuous tenderness and love!aside.TERIBAZUS.And dost thou weep too Roman?RHADAMISTUS.From such horror,
And so much cruelty my nature shrinks.—Whatever purpose rolls within thy breast,Boldly confide it—shall I arm'd with vengeanceAssault the purple tyrant in his camp?Or wilt thou join my steps;—then in the frontOf a brave vet'ran legion head the war,Seek the usurper 'midst his plumed troops,And thus avenge mankind?TERIBAZUS.No; far from me,Far be the guilt of meditating aughtAgainst the life from whence my being sprung.Let him oppress me,—he's a parent still!—RHADAMISTUS.He rives my heart!—oh! what a lot is mine!aside.TERIBAZUS.Not for myself I fear; but oh! Flamminius,A lovely captive,—'tis for her I tremble;—For Ariana,—for that sweet perfection;—She is her sex's boast!—her gentle bosomFraught with each excellence!—her form and featureTouch'd by the hand of elegance;—adorn'dBy ev'ry grace, and cast in beauty's mould!—Her Pharasmanes means to ravish from me.—But thou convey her hence—'tis all I ask.—RHADAMISTUS.By heav'n I will—do thou too join our flight;—Armenia shall be thine, and that sweet maidReward thy goodness with connubial love,Adorn thy throne, and make a nation bless'd!—TERIBAZUS.Make Ariana happy;—bear her henceAnd save those bright unviolated charmsFrom Pharasmanes' pow'r—when wish'd for peaceSettles a jarring world, Flamminius then,Then will I seek thee.—Wilt thou then resign her?RHADAMISTUS.Yes then, as pure as the unsullied snowThat never felt a sunbeam;—then I'll give herBack to thy faithful love.TERIBAZUS.Thou gen'rous Roman,In gratitude I bow—she's here at hand;A moment brings her to you, while at distanceI watch each avenue, each winding path,That none intrude upon your privacy.—Exit.RHADAMISTUS. alone.At length I've seen my brother;—know how muchHe differs from his father!—he shall seekThe Roman tents;—I'll there disclose myself;There will embrace him with a brother's love.—Oh! how the tender transport heaves and swells,Till thus the fond excess disolves in tears!—Enter MEGISTUS, leading ZENOBIA.ZENOBIA.Alas! my heart forebodes I know not what—MEGISTUS.Dispel each doubt—this is your only refuge.—ZENOBIA.Thou gen'rous Roman,—if distress like mine—If an unhappy captive may approach thee—RHADAMISTUS.To me affliction's voice—ye pow'rs of heav'n!That air!—those features!—that remember'd glance!ZENOBIA.If thus a wretch's presence can alarm you—RHADAMISTUS.The music of that voice!—such once she look'd!

That all-perfection yielded to another,Were the worst agony, the keenest stabThat ever pierc'd a lover to the soul.—The thought,—the very thought inflames to madness!—RHADAMISTUS.(Aside) Not till the fever of his mind subsides,Must I reveal me—the disclosure nowWould to his phrenzy give a whirlwind's wing,And bury all in ruin—let her then;Yes, Teribazus, let the blooming maidStill in this camp, a Voluntary captive,—Since you will have it so—since weak mistrustCan taint a noble spirit,—let her hereTeach that rare beauty to display it's charms,It's various graces;—bid those radiant eyesDart their quick glances to the tyrant's soul,Inflame his hot desires, and half absolve them.TERIBAZUS.Madness and horror!—no!—haste, fly, begone,And give her hence safe-conduct—I can trustTo Roman continence—your Scipio's praiseShall be the theme of fame's eternal lip!—RHADAMISTUS.Thou too attend her steps;—watch all her ways;—When we have reach'd the Roman sanctuary,Then shall such wonders to thy list'ning ear,—The web which fate has wove—beware, my friend—Tigranes comes—what would'st thou Sir?Enter TIGRANES.TIGRANES.The kingGrants you one parley more—ev'n now this wayHe bends his steps—remote from all he meansTo hold a private conf'rence—RHADAMISTUS.Rome's ambassadorAttends his pleasure.—Exit Tigranes.TERIBAZUS.I must hence, Flamminius—Farewell!—yet er'e thou goe'st,—I still must craveAnother interview—farewell!—remember,My love, my life, my all depend on thee.—Exit.RHADAMISTUS.Ah!

Whate'er the grace that reveals in her feature,Glows in her bloom, or sparkles in her eye,They all are transient beauties, soon to fade,And leave inanimate that decent form.Inward affliction saps the vital frame,Incurable affliction!—fix'd in woeHer eyes for ever motionless and dimGaze on the fancied image of her husband.PHARASMANES.Her husband!MEGISTUS.Yes; a husband sever'd from herBy fatal chance!—him she for ever seesWith fancy's gushing eye, and seeks him stillIn fond excursions of delusive thought.She pines each hour, and ev'n in blooming dies,As drooping roses,—while the worm unseenPreys on their fragrant sweets, still beauteous look,And waste their aromatic lives in air.PHARASMANES.The rose transplanted to a warmer skyShall raise it's languid head, and all be well.MEGISTUS.Her husband still survives, and far remoteHe wanders in Armenia's realm—PHARASMANES.No moreTo call her his!—by all my promis'd joysHis doom is fix'd!—do thou streight seek thy daughter,My loveliest Ariana—in her earBreathe the mild accents of a father's voice,And reconcile her heart to love and me.MEGISTUS.Your pardon Sir—it were not fit my voiceShould teach her to betray her holy vows.PHARASMANES.When Pharasmanes speaks—MEGISTUS.My life is his,—And when he wills it, 'tis devoted to him—But, Sir, tho' poor,—my honour still is mine,'Tis all that heav'n has giv'n me,—and that giftThe gods expect I never should resign.PHARASMANES.And do'st thou hesitate?—what, when a crownInvites thy daughter to imperial splendor?MEGISTUS.Oh! not for me such splendor!—I have liv'dMy humble days in virtuous poverty.To tend my flock, to watch each rising flow'r,Each herb, each plant that drinks the morning dew,And lift my praise to the just gods on high!—These were my habits, these my only cares;——These hands suffic'd to answer my desires,And having naught,—yet naught was wanting to me.PHARASMANES.Away, thou slave!—I would not quite despise thee—Or yield your daughter, or my swiftest vengeanceFalls on thy hoary head—a monarch's loveShall seize her trembling to his eager arms,Then spurn her back a prey to wan despair,Till bitter anguish blast each wither'd charm,And rave in vain for love and empire scorn'd!—Exit.MEGISTUS, alone.Fell monster go!—inexorable tyrant!—Perhaps I should have sooth'd his lion rageWith feign'd compliance—ha!—why sudden thus—Enter ZENOBIA.ZENOBIA.Th' important hour, Megistus, now approaches—
Lo! the last blushes of departing dayBut feebly streak yon dim horizon's verge.My Rhadamistus comes to guide my steps—Thro' devious paths seek thou Zopiron's tent—Thus we shall lull suspicion—MEGISTUS.I obey;—May guardian angels spread their wings around thee!—Exit.ZENOBIA, alone.Yes, the bless'd gods, who thro' the maze of fateHave led us once again to meet in life,Will prove the friends of virtue to the last.—Ha!—Teribazus comes!—ZENOBIA, TERIBAZUS.TERIBAZUS.And is it giv'nOnce more to see thee here?—do'st thou avoid me?Do'st thou despise me in this tender momentWhen my soul bleeds with anguish at the thoughtOf parting with thee?—Ariana!—ZENOBIA.Oh!—Unhappy prince!—oh! fly me; shun me; deathAnd ruin follow—one short moment's stayWill rouze your father's rage—TERIBAZUS.My father's rageAlready has undone me—ah! in tears!——And do they fall for me?—does that soft sighHeave for the lost, afflicted Teribazus?—ZENOBIA.Yes the tear falls, and the sigh heaves for thee—Thy elegance of mind—the various gracesThat bloom around thee, and adorn the hero,—Nay, other ties there are which strongly plead,
And bid me tremble for thee.—And yet,—sad recompense for all thy friendship,To warn thee hence,—to bid thee shun my ways,Is all the gratitude I now can offer.—TERIBAZUS.Thus must we part?—ZENOBIA.A rival is at hand,—Here in the camp,—an unexpected rival,—Sent by the gods,—the idol of my soul!TERIBAZUS.What say'st thou, Ariana?—has anotherUsurp'd thy heart?—unkind, relentless maid!—Since first thy beauty dawn'd upon my sight,How have I lov'd,—repented,—yet lov'd on!—Ev'n against you,—against myself I struggled—Present I fled you—absent I ador'd—I fled for refuge to the forest's gloom,—But in the forest's gloom thy image met me!—The shades of night, the lustre of the day,All, all retrac'd my Ariana's form.—Thy form pursued me in the battle's rage,'Midst shouts, and all the clangor of the war.—It stole me from myself!—my lonely tentRe-ecchoes with my groans, and in the ranksThe wond'ring soldier hears my voice no more,ZENOBIA.Yet leave me Teribazus—gen'rous youth!Remembrance oft shall dwell upon thy praise,But for my love 'tis all another's claim.TERIBAZUS.Another's claim!—why wilt thou torture thusA fond despairing wretch?—oh! not for meThose sorrows fall—they are another's tears;—Another claims them from me—name this rivalThat my swift fury—tell me has Flamminius,Has the base Roman broke his promis'd faith?Will not the barb'rous man afford you shelter?ZENOBIA.Why wilt thou force me speak?—the fate of all,Thine Teribazus,—mine,—the fate of one,Whom, were he known,—thy heart holds ever dear,Is now concern'd—Flamminius claims my love—Long since he won my heart—TERIBAZUS.Vindictive gods!Flamminius claims thy love!—not Caesar's selfShall dare to wrest thee from me—Ariana!—Thus on my knees,—would I could perish here—That ev'n in death I still might gaze upon thee,Till the last pang divide thee from my heart.Enter RHADAMISTUS.RHADAMISTUS.It was the voice of anguish and despair!Why thus illustrious prince—TERIBAZUS.(Starting up) Thou treach'rous Roman!—Who com'st to violate each sacred tie,The laws of honour, and the laws of love!Who com'st beneath the mask of public faithTo do a robber's work!—RHADAMISTUS.When to your campI bring a heart that longs to serve you, prince,Why this intemp'rate rage?—TERIBAZUS.To do the workOf perfidy and fraud!—but first by rapine,By violated maids your city grew;—And do you come to emulate your sires?Unwilling to degenerate in vice.—RHADAMISTUS.Mistaken youth!—oh! if you did but know me!If you but knew the justice Rome intends—TERIBAZUS.Justice and Rome!—and dost thou dare to joinTwo names so opposite?—have we not heardOf frugal consuls, and of stoic chiefs,Who soon forgetting here their sabine farms,Made war a trade, and then return'd to RomeRich with the plunder of the rifled east?Again some new Lucullus leads them on,Fir'd with the love of rapine.—RHADAMISTUS.Fir'd with zealTo break a nation's chains—would'st thou but hear me——It is a friend implores—ZENOBIA.A gen'rous friend!—Then listen to him—let these streaming eyes,These earnest pray'rs—this supplicating form—TERIBAZUS.Leagu'd with my foe behold her!—mighty gods!—Have I deserv'd it of her?—RHADAMISTUS.Yet be calm—Yet listen to me—Oh!

I've heap'd these horrors on your head—I've seal'd thy doom—that is a brother's gift—The first essay of Teribazus' friendship!—But I am doom'd to be a wretch abhorr'd,Of men and gods abhorr'd!—doom'd like my fatherTo drench these murd'rous hands in brother's blood!—RHADAMISTUS.Imbitter not the pangs that rive my soul—Where is Zenobia?—unrelenting pow'rs!Was it for this your persecuting wrathGave me to meet her, gave that angel-sweetnessTo these delighted eyes, these eager arms?TERIBAZUS.I'll give you freedom still—by heav'n I will—RHADAMISTUS.Was she but giv'n me to afflict her more?To wake in that dear breast a gleam of joy,A mockery of joy,—joy scarce, ye pow'rs!Divided by the moment of delightFrom black despair, from agony and death?TERIBAZUS.I will protect her,—will restore her to thee,Or do a deed shall strike mankind with horror!Not ev'n a father shall retard my sword—In his own blood I'll drench it—RHADAMISTUS.Ha!—TERIBAZUS.This hand,E're thou shalt fall a victim to his fury,Shall to the heart,—th' inhuman heart of him—Who dares—RHADAMISTUS.No more of that—can I consent,That a brave gen'rous youth, a much lov'd brother,For ev'ry virtue fam'd,—shall thus debaseBy an atrocious deed his fair renown,And perpetrate a dark insidious work?—Oh! I should well deserve the worst of ills—I then should justify a father's Cruelty!—TERIBAZUS.He has undone thee—has undone as all—But yet thou shalt not die—by heav'n I swear—Yes, take me, horror! pour into my heartThy blackest purpose—nerve my lifted armTo dash him headlong from his glitt'ring throneA terrible example to the world.RHADAMISTUS.Beware, beware, my brother—yet reflect—You would strike vice with terror—tell me then,Would not the act of rash impetuous zeal,Would not th' example arm the ruffian's hand?Thy virtue thus inflames thy gen'rous ardor—But oh! my brother, let it not be saidThat virtue ever held the murd'rer's knife!TERIBAZUS.Gods! have I ruin'd such unheard of goodness?—Swift I'll dispatch a message to Paulinus,And call his legions to assault the camp—Enter TIGRANES, and Guards.TIGRANES.Guards, seize your pris'ner—in a dungeon's gloomPlunge him sequester'd from the light of heav'n.'Tis Pharasmanes' will—TERIBAZUS.Thou medling fiend!I will attend his steps; will still protect himFrom men like thee—RHADAMISTUS.Should Pharasmanes dareTo violate the rights of public law,Rome is at hand, and will have ample vengeance.Exit with Teribazus.TIGRANES.My thirst of vengeance shall be sated first.—Yes, guard him, prince; it makes thy ruin sure!Thy Ariana too, while fats is busy,Shall meet her doom, and leave my road to gloryAll smooth and level to ambition's wish.Enter ZOPIRON.ZOPIRON.'Gainst Rome's ambassador the king, Tigranes,

Then more collected, with undaunted stepShe to the altar bore the nuptial cup.There reverent bow'd, and "hear ye gods," she said,"Hear and record the purpose of my soul."With trembling lips then kiss'd the sacred vase,And as our country's solemn rites require,Drank of the hallow'd liquor.—From her handThe king receiv'd it, and with eager joy,As to his soul he took the hectar'd draught,With stedfast eye she view'd him, whilst a smileOf sickly joy gleam'd faintly o'er her visage.TIGRANES.Well, she's our queen—the diadem is hers—ZOPIRON.How long to wear it, heav'n alone can tell.—The back scene draws, and discovers the king's pavillion, with an altar, and fire blazing on it; soft musick is play'd, and they come forward.PHARASMANES and ZENOBIA.PHARASMANES.At length my Ariana's soft complianceEndears the present bliss, and gives an earnestOf joy to brighten a long train of years.ZENOBIA.Alas! fond man expatiates oft in fancy,Unconscious of the fates, and oft in thoughtAnticipates a bliss he ne'er enjoys.PHARASMANES.Away with gloomy care; for thou ar't mine,Thou, Ariana!—all our future daysShall smile with gay, with ever-young desire,And not a cloud o'ercast the bright serene.ZENOBIA.And does thy penetrating eye pervadeWhat time has yet in store?PHARASMANES.Why dost thou ask?ZENOBIA.I have been us'd to grief—release the Roman,And give him hence safe conduct to his friends;—I then shall be at peace.—PHARASMANES.Beware, beware!Nor rouze again the pangs, that fire a soul,Which fiercely doats like mine.ZENOBIA.Dismiss him hence;Give him his life—it was your marriage vowHe should not suffer—let me see him first;—Grant me one interview,—one little hour;In that poor space I can crowd all that's left meOf love, and tenderness, and fond concern,Before we part for ever—PHARASMANES.Fond concern!And love, and tenderness!—and shall the RomanUsurp a monarch's due?—that look betraysThe secret workings of a heart estrang'd!And shall the man, who dares dispute my love,Shall the slave breathe a moment?—haste, Tigranes,And see immediate execution on him.Exit Tigranes.ZENOBIA.Oh! stay Tigranes—barb'rous man, recallThe horrid mandate—PHARASMANES.By immortal love,I see the slave still triumphs in your heart.ZENOBIA.Oh! spare him, spare him—by the vital air,By your own promis'd faith—Kneels to him.PHARASMANES.Since lov'd by theeHis doom is doubly seal'd.—ZENOBIA.You shall not fly me—Now tear me, drag me groveling in the dust,Tear off these hands—tear, tear me peice-meal first—PHARASMANES.Nay, then since force must do it—Shakes her off.ZENOBIA.Barb'rous tyrant!She lies stretch'd on the ground.PHARASMANES.I go to see the minion of your heartExpire in pangs before me—ha!—what meansThis more than winter's frost that chills my veins?—ZENOBIA.(Looking up) That groan revives, and calls me back to life!—PHARASMANES.I cannot move—each vital function's lost—The purple current of my blood is stopt—I freeze—I burn—oh!

When there that form—think ye I'll linger here?—Dead, dead Zenobia!—still I have thee thus—You ne'er shall part us—this at least I'll hold,And cling for ever to these pale, pale charms;Here breathe my last, and faithful still in death,Love shall unite us in one peaceful grave.MEGISTUS.Now, old Megistus, gods! has liv'd too long!—TERIBAZUS.Bring ev'ry aid, all medicinal skillTo call a wretched brother back to life,And give each lenient balm to woes like his.From thee ambition, what misfortunes flow?To thee what varied ills weak mortals owe?'Twas this for years laid desolate the land,And arm'd against a son the father's hand;To black despair poor lost Zenobia drove;The hapless victim of disastrous love!—EPILOGUE:Written by DAVID GARRICK, Esq;And Spoken by Mrs. ABINGTON.(She peeps thro' the Curtain)HOW do you all, good folks?—In tears for certain,I'll only take a PEEP BEHIND THE CURTAIN;You're all so full of tragedy, and sadness!For me to come among ye, would be madness:This is no time for giggling—when you've leisure,Call out for me, and I'll attend your pleasure;As soldiers hurry at the beat of drum,Beat but your hands, that instant I will come.She enters upon their clapping.This is so good, to call me out so soon—The COMIC MUSE by me intreats a BOON;She call'd for PRITCHARD, her first maid of honour,And begg'd of her to take the task upon her;But she,—I'm sure you'll all be sorry for't,Resigns her place, and soon retires from court:To bear this loss, we courtiers make a shift,When good folks leave us, worse may have a lift.The COMIC MUSE, whose ev'ry smile is grace,And her STAGE SISTER, with her tragic face,Have had a quarrel—each has writ a CASE.And on their friends assembled now I wait,To give you of THEIR DIFFERENCE A TRUE STATE.MELPOMENE, complains when she appears,—For five good acts, in all her pomp of tears,To raise your souls, and with her raptures wing 'em,Nay wet your handkercheifs, that you may wring 'em.Some flippant hussey, like myself comes in;Crack goes her fan, and with a giggling grin,Hey! PRESTO PASS!—all topsy turvy see,For Ho, HO, HO! is chang'd to HE, HE, HE!We own the fault, but 'tis a fault in vogue,'Tis theirs, who call and bawl for—EPILOGUE!
Oh! shame upon you—for the time to comeKnow better—and go miserable home.What says our COMIC GODDESS?—with reproaches,She vows her SISTER TRAGEDY encroaches!And spite of all her virtue, and ambition,Is known to have an am'rous disposition:For in FALSE DELICACY—wond'rous sly,Join'd with a certain IRISHMAN—O fye!She made you, when you ought to laugh, to cry.—Her sister's smiles with tears she try'd to smother,Rais'd such a tragi-comic kind of pother,You laugh'd with one eye, while you cry'd with t'other.What can be done?—sad work behind the scenes!There comic females scold with tragic queens.Each party different ways the foe assails,These shake their daggers, those prepare their nails.'Tis You alone must calm these dire mishaps,Or we shall still continue pulling caps.What is your will?—I read it in your faces;That all hereafter take their proper places,Shake hands, and kiss and friends, and—BURN THEIR CASES.FINIS.
