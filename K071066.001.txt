OF IMAG. ENLARGED.EDINBURG: AT THE Apollo Press, BY THE MARTINS. Anno 1781.THE LIFE OF MARK AKENSIDE.MARK AKENSIDE, an eminent poet and physician, was born at Newcastle upon Tyne the 9th Nov. 1721. He was second son of Mark Akenside, a substantial butcher of that town: his mother's name was Mary Lumsden. At the freeschool of Newcastle young Akenside received the first part of his education; he was next committed to the care of Mr. Wilson, a dissenting clergyman who kept a private academy at Newcastle.About the eighteenth year of his age our Author was sent to the university of Edinburgh, in the view of qualifying himself for the duties of a Presbyterian pastor, his parents and relations in general being of the Presbyterian sect. Mr. Akenside received some assistance from the funds which the English Dissenters employ in educating young men of no opulent fortunes; but his views as to the ministry altering, he bent his studies towards physick, and honestly repaid to his benefactors the money they had advanced for him, which being contributed for a different purpose than promoting the study of physick he thought it dishonourable to retain. Whether in relinquishing his design of being a Dissenting clergyman he also ceased to be a Dissenter is not certainly known.
Akenside's genius and taste for poetry displayed themselves early when at Newcastle school, and during his continuance at Mr. Wilson's academy. His Pleasures of Imagination, with several other poems,  said, were first written by him at Morpeth while upon a visit to his relations, and before he went to the university of Edinburgh, where he also distinguished himself by his poetical compositions. His Ode on the Winter Solstice, which is dated 1740, was certainly composed at that place.After three years study at Edinburgh Mr. Akenside went (1741) to Leyden, where on 16th May 1744 he took his degree of Doctor in Physick. Same year appeared his Pleasures of Imagination, a poem which procured him some emolument and much reputation. This poem was followed by An Epistle to Curio, an acrimonious attack on the political conduct of William Pulteney Earl of Bath, whom he stigmatizes under the name of Curio as the betrayer of his country, also published in the 1744. Akenside dissatisfied with this performance altered it exceedingly: he converted the Epistle into an Ode, and reduced it to less than half the number of lines of which it originally consisted. In the 1745 he published his first Collection of Odes, ten in number. In 1748 came out his Ode to the Earl of Huntingdon; and in 1758 he attempted to rouse the national spirit by An Ode to the Country Gentlemen of England. Few of his remaining

poems were published separately, excepting the Ode to Thomas Edwards, Esq. which though written in 1751 was not printed till the year 1766. The rest of Dr. Akenside's poems which appeared in his lifetime were given, at least for the most part, in the sixth volume of Dodsley's Collection.Soon after his return from Leyden he commenced physician at Northampton, where Dr. Stonehouse then practised with reputation and success. Whilst here he carried on an amicable debate with Dr. Doddridge concerning the opinions of the ancient philosophers with regard to a future state of rewards and punishments, in which Dr. Akenside supported the firm belief of Cicero in particular in this great article of natural religion. Not meeting with sufficient encouragement at Northampton, or being ambitious of a larger field in which to display his talents, he removed to Hampstead, where he resided upwards of two years, and then finally fixed himself in London.At London he was well known as a poet, but had still to force his way as a physician. At first he had but little practice, and would probably have been reduced to difficulties had not Mr. Dyson, his intimate friend, generously allowed him 300l. a year, which enabled him to make a proper appearance in the world. In time the Doctor acquired considerable reputation and practice, and arrived at most of the honours incident to his profession: he became a Fellow of the Royal

Society, a Physician to St. Thomas's Hospital, was admitted by mandamus to the degree of Doctor in Physick in the university of Cambridge, and elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in London, and upon the settlement of the Queen's household was appointed one of the Physicians to her Majesty. He perhaps might have still rose to a greater elevation of character had not his studies ended with his life by a putrid fever 23d June 1770, in the 49th year of his age. He was buried in the parish of St. James's Westminster.Dr. Akenside was much devoted to the study of ancient literature, and was a great admirer of Plato, Cicero, and the best philosophers of antiquity. His knowledge and taste in this respect are conspicuous in his poems, and in the Notes and Illustrations which he hath annexed to them. That he had a sincere reverence for the great and fundamental principles of religion is apparent from numberless passages in his writings. His high veneration for the Supreme Being, his noble sentiments of the wisdom and benevolence of the Divine Providence, and his zeal for the cause of virtue, are conspicuous in all his poems. His regard to the Christian revelation, and his solicitude to have it preserved in its native purity, are displayed in the Ode to the Bishop of Winchester, His attachment to the cause of civil and religious liberty is a distinguished feature in the character of his poetical writings:

he embraces every occasion of displaying his ardour concerning this subject; and two of his Odes, those to the Earl of Huntingdon and the Bishop of Winchester, are directly consecrated to it.Dr. Akenside is to be considered as a didactick and lyrick poet. His chief work, The Pleasures of Imagination, was received with great applause, and raised the Author's reputation high in the poetical world. Pope, on looking into the manuscript before publication, is reported to have said "That the Author was no every-day writer." Mr. Cooper, in his Letters concerning Taste, speaks of Akenside in the following strain of commendation: "For my part I am of opinion that there is now living a poet of as genuine a genius as this kingdom ever produced, Shakespeare alone excepted. By poetical genius I do not mean the mere talent of making verses, but that glorious enthusiasm of soul, that fine phrensy, in which the poet's eye rowling glances from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven, as Shakespeare feelingly describes it. This alone is poetry; aught else is a mechanical art of putting syllables harmonicusly together. The gentleman I mean is Dr. Akenside, the worthy Author of The Pleasures of Imagination, the most beautiful didactick poem that ever adorned the English language." On the other hand the late Mr. Gray, in a letter to Mr. Wharton of Old Park near Durham, dated Peterhouse 26th April 1744,

(Mason's 4to edit. of Gray, p. 178.) says, "You desire to know, it seems, what character the poem of your young friend (Dr. Akenside) bears here. I wonder that you ask the opinion of a nation where those who pretend to judge do not judge at all, and the rest (the wiser part) wait to catch the judgment of the world immediately above them, that is, Dick's and the Rainbow coffeehouses. Your readier way would be to ask the ladies who keep the bars in those two theatres of criticism. However, to shew you that I am a judge as well as my countrymen, I will tell you, though I have rather turned it over than read it, (Pleasures of Imagination) but no matter, no more have they, that it seems to me above the middling, and now and then, for a little while, rises even to the best, particularly in description. It is often obscure, and even unintelligible, and too much infected with the Hutchinson jargon. In short, its great fault is that it was published at least nine years too early. And so methinks, in a few words, a la mode du Temple. I have very prettily dispatched what perhaps may for several years have employed a very ingenious man worth fifty of myself.""As these observations were hastily delivered in a private letter, before the poem had been maturely examined, we may be allowed (say the writers of The Biographia to think them too severe, and to

steer a middle course between Mr. Gray and Mr. Cooper. The obscurity of The Pleasures of Imagination, when read with attention, will chiefly be found in the allegory of the second book, which we freely confess we could never understand. It might likewise have been better if the peculiar language of Hutchinson, or rather of Shaftesbury, had sometimes been omitted. Nevertheless we cannot but regard it as a noble and beautiful poem, exhibiting many bright displays of genius and fancy, and holding out sublime views of Nature, Providence, and morality. We concur with Mr. Gray in thinking it was published too early: the Author himself became afterwards of the same sentiment; he was convinced that the poem was defective in some respects, and redundant in others.""That it wanted revision and correction," says Mr. Dyson, his editor, "he was sufficiently sensible; but so quick was the demand for several successive republications, that in any of the intervals to have completed the whole of his corrections was utterly impossible; and yet to have gone on from time to time in making farther improvements in every new edition would, he thought, have had the appearance at least of abusing the favour of the publick: he chose therefore to continue for some time reprinting it without alteration, and to forbear publishing any corrections or improvements until he should be able at once to

give them to the publick complete: and with this view he went on for several years to review and correct his poem at leisure, till at length he found the task grow so much upon his hands, that despairing of ever being able to execute if sufficiently to his own satisfction he abandoned the purpose of correcting, and resolved to write the poem over anew, upon a somewhat different and an enlarged plan."Dr. Akenside did not live to finish the whole of his plan: that part of it which is carried into execution occurs next in this edition, and the reader may judge of the Doctor's intentions by having recourse to the General Argument prefixed to the poem. He designed at first to compromise the whole of his subject, according to a new plan, in four books; but he afterwards changed his purpose, and determined to distribute The Pleasures of Imagination into a greater number of books. How far his scheme would have carried him, if he had lived to complete it, is uncertain, for at his death he had only finished the first and second books, a considerable part of the third, and the introduction to the fourth. The first book of the improved work bears a nearer resemblance to the first book of the former editions than any of the rest do to each other: there are nevertheless in this book a great number of corrections and alterations, and several considerable additions. Dr Akenside has introduced a tribute of respect and affection to his friend Mr. Dyson; he has referred

The Pleasures of Imagination to two sources only, Greatness and Beauty, and not to three, as he had heretofore done: his delineation of beautiful objects is much enlarged; and, upon the whole, the first book seems to have received no small degree of improvement. The second book is very different from the second book of the preceeding editions: the difference indeed is so great that they cannot be compared together. The Author enters into a display of Truth and its three classes, matter of Fact, experimental or scientifical Truth, and universal Truth. He treats likewise of Virtue, as existing in the Divine Mind, of human virtue, of Vice and its origin, of Ridicule, and of the Passions. What he hath said upon the subject of ridicule is greatly and advantageously reduced from what it was in the former copies. The enumeration of the different sources of ridicule is left out, and consequently somelines which had given offence to Dr. Warburton. The allegorical Vision which heretofore constituted a principal part of the second book is likewise omitted. The poetical character of the second book, as it now stands, is, that it is correct, moral, and noble. The third book is an episode, in which Solon the Athenian lawgiver is the chief character; and the design of it seems to be, to shew the great influence of poetry in enforcing the cause of Liberty. This part is entirely new, and if it had been finished would have proved a beautiful addition to the poem. It is greatly to be regretted

that Dr. Akenside did not live to complete his design; nevertheless we should have been sorry to have had the original poem entirely superseded. Whatever may be its faults there is in it a certain brightness and brilliancy of imagination, and a certain degree of enthusiasm, which the Doctor did not seem to have possessed in equal vigour in the latter part of his life. Years, and an application to scientifick studies, appear in some measure to have turned his mind from sound to things, from fancy to the understanding.Dr. Johnson, in his life of Akenside, says of this poem, "It has undoubtedly a just claim to very particular notice, as an example of great felicity of genius, and uncommon amplitude of acquisitions, of a young mind stored with images, and much exercised in combining and comparing them." Of the altered work he adds, "He seems to have somewhat contracted his diffusion; but I know not whether he has gained in closeness what he has lost in splendour.""To The Pleasures of Imagination," continue the authors of The Biographia, "succeed two books of Odes, the first containing eighteen, the second fifteen odes. It was Dr. Akenside's intention, if he had lived, to have made each book consist of twenty odes. Those which had been formerly published are greatly altered and improved. The Doctor's odes are not equal to the beautiful productions of

Mr Gray, nor perhaps to those of one or two living writers; but still there is in them a noble vein of poetry, united with manly sense, and applied to excellent purposes. This encomium cannot be extended to the whole of the odes without exception: Dr. Akenside does not always preserve the dignity of the lyrick Muse: he is defective in the pathetick even upon a subject which peculiarly required it, and where it might have been most expected, the death of his mistress, we mean his Ode to the Evening Star. However, his Hymn to Cheerfulness, and his Odes on leaving Holland, on Lyrick Poetry, to the Earl of Huntingdon, and on Recovering from a sit of Sickness, justly entitle him to a place among the principal Lyrick writers of this country.""Of his Odes," says Dr. Johnson, "nothing favourable can be said.—To examine such compositions singly cannot be required; they have doubtless brighter and darker parts; but when they are once found to be generally dull all further labour may be spared: for to what use can the work be criticised that will not be read?" In this diversity of opinions the reader will determine for himself.Dr. Akenside's principal medical performance was, 1. His Dissertatio de Dysenteria, published in 1764, which has been commended as an elegant specimen of Latinity: it was twice translated into English. He also wrote, 2. Observations on the Origin and Use of

the Lymphatick Vessels in Animals. 3. An Account of a Blow on the Heart, and its Effects. 4. Oratio Anniversaria, ex Instituto Harveii, in Theatro Collegii Regalis Modicorum Londinensis habita, Anno 1759. 5. Observations on Cancers. 6. Of the Use of Ipecacuanha in Asthmas. 7. A Method of treating White Swellings of the Joints. Besides these he read at the College some Practical Observations made at St. Thomas's Hospital on the putrid Erysipelas, which he intended forthe second volume of The Medical Transactions. This paper he carried home with a design to correct it, but it was not returned at the time of his death. Being appointed Cronian Lecturer he chose for his subject "The History of the Revival of Learning," and read three lectures on it before the College, but from which he soon desisted, it was supposed in disgust, some one of the College having objected that he had chosen a subject foreign to the institution. Most of the above pieces were published in The Philosophical and Medical Transactions.ADVERTISEMENT TO THE EDITION 1772.THIS volume contains a complete collection of the poems of the late Dr. Akenside, either reprinted from the original editions, or faithfully published from copies which had been prepared by himself for publication.That the principal poem should appear in so disadvantageous a state may require some explanation. The first publication of it was at a very early part of the Author's life; that it wanted revision and correction he was sufficiently sensible; but so quick was the demand for several successive republications, that in any of the intervals to have completed the whole of his corrections was utterly impossible; and yet to have gone on from time to time in making farther improvements in every new edition would, he thought, have had the appearance at least of abusing the favour of the publick: he chose therefore to continue for some time reprinting it without alteration, and to forbear publishing any corrections or improvements until he should be able at once to give them to the publick complete: and with this view he went on for several years to review and correct his poem at leisure, till at length he found the task grow so much upon his hands, that despairing of ever being able to execute it sufficiently to his own satisfaction he abandoned the

purpose of correcting, and resolved to write the poem over anew upon a somewhat different and an enlarged plan: and in the execution of this design he had made a considerable progress. What reason there may be to regret that he did not live to execute the whole of it will best appear from the perusal of the plan itself, as stated in the General Argument, and of the parts which he had executed, and which are here published: for the personThe Right Hon. Jeremiah Dyson, by whom this Advertisement was written. to whom he intrusted the disposal of his papers would have thought himself wanting as well to the service of the publick as to the fame of his friend if he had not produced as much of the work as appeared to have been prepared for publication. In this light he considered the entire first and second books, of which a few copies had been printed for the use only of the Author and certain friends; also a very considerable part of the third book, which had been transcribed in order to its being printed in the same manner; and to these is added the introduction to a subsequent book, which in the manuscript is called the fourth, and which appears to have been composed at the time when the Author intended to comprise the whole in four books; but which, as he had afterwards determined to distribute the poem into more books, might perhaps more properly be called the last book. And this is all that is executed of

the new work, which although it appeared to the editor too valuable, even in its imperfect state, to be withholden from the publick, yet (he conceives) takes in by much too small a part of the original poem to supply its place, and to supersede the republication of it; for which reason both the poems are inserted in this Collection.Of Odes the Author had designed to make up two books, consisting of twenty odes each, including the several odes which he had before published at different times.The Hymn to the Naiads is reprinted from the sixth volume of Dodsley's Miscellanies, with a few corrections, and the addition of some Notes. To the Inscriptions, taken from the same volume, three new Inscriptions are added, the last of which is the only instance wherein a liberty has been taken of inserting any thing in this Collection which did not appear to have been intended by the Author for publicationIn the present edition a few pieces are added which are known to be genuine, and which certainly are no discredit to heir Author., among whose papers no copy of this was found, but it is printed from a copy which he had many years since given to the editor.THE DESIGN.THERE are certain powers in human nature which seem to hold a middle place between the organs of bodly sense and the faculties of moral perception: they have been called by a very general name "The Powers of Imagination." Like the external senses they relate to matter and motion, and at the same time give the mind ideas analogous to those of moral approbation and dislike. As they are the inlets of some of the most exquisite Pleasures with which we are acquainted, it has naturally happened that men of warm and sensible tempers have sought means to recal the delightful perceptions which they afford, independent of the objects which originally produced them. This gave rise to the imitative or designing arts, some of which, as painting and sculpture, directly copy the external appearances which were admired in nature; others, as musick and poetry, bring them back to remembrance by signs universally established and understood.But these arts as they grew more correct and deliberate were of course led to extend their imitation beyond the peculiar objects of the imaginative powers especially poetry, which making use of language a the instrument by which it imitates, is consequently become an unlimited representative of every speci and mode of being; yet as their intention was only to express the objects of Imagination, and as they still abound chiefly in ideas of that class, they of cours retain their original character, and all the differen
Pleasures which they excite are termed in general Pleasures of Imagination.The Design of the following Poem is to give a view of these in the largest acceptation of the term, so that whatever our Imagination feels from the agreeable appearances of nature, and all the various entertainment we meet with either in poetry, painting, musick, or any of the elegant arts, might be deducible from one or other of those principles in the constitution of the human mind which are here established and explained.In executing this general plan it was necessary first of all to distinguish the Imagination from our other faculties, and in the next place to characterize those original forms or properties of being about which it is conversant, and which are by nature adapted to it, as light is to the eyes, or truth to the understanding. These properties Mr. Addison had reduced to the three general classes of Greatness, Novelty, and Beauty; and into these we may analyze every object, however complex, which, properly speaking, is delightful to the imagination. But such an object may also include many other sources of Pleasure, and its beauty, or novelty, or grandeur, will make a stronger impression by reason of this concurrence. Besides which the imitative arts, especially poetry, owe much of their effect to a similar exhibition of properties quite foreign to the imagination, insomuch that in every line of the most applauded poems we meet with either ideas drawn from the external senses, or truths discovered

to the understanding, or illustrations of contrivance and final causes, or, above all the rest, with circumstances proper to awaken and engage the passions; it was therefore necessary to enumerate and exemplify thse different species of Pleasure, especially that from the passions, which as it is supreme in the noblest work of human genius, so being in some particulars not a little surprising, gave an opportunity to enliven the didactick turn of the poem by introducing an allegory to account for the appearance.After these parts of the subject which hold chiefly of admiration, or naturally warm and interest the mind, a Pleasure of a very different nature, that which arises from Ridicule, came next to be considered. As this is the foundation of the comick manner in all the arts, and has been but very imperfectly treated by moral writers, it was thought proper to give it a particular illustration, and to distinguish the general sources from which the ridicule of characters is derived. Here too a change of style became necessary, such a one as might yet be consistent, if possible, with the general taste of composition in the serious parts of the subject; nor is it an easy task to give any tolerable force to images of this kind without running eithe into the gigantick expressions of the mock heroick,  the familiar and poetical raillery of professed satire neither of which would have been proper here.The materials of all imitation being thus laid open nothing now remained but to illustrate some particular

Pleasures which arise either from the relations of different objects one to another, or from the nature of imitation itself. Of the first kind is that various and complicated resemblance existing between several parts of the material and immaterial worlds, which is the foundation of metaphor and wit. As it seems in a great measure to depend on the early association of our ideas, and as this habit of associating is the source of many Pleasures and pains in life, and on that account bears a great share in the influence of poetry and the other arts, it is therefore mentioned here, and its effects described: then follows a general account of the production of these elegant arts, and of the secondary Pleasure, as it is called, arising from the resemblance of their imitations to the original appearances of nature: after which the work concludes with some reflections on the general conduct of the powers of Imagination, and on their natural and moral usefulness in life.Concerning the manner or turn of composition which prevails in this piece little can be said with propriety by the Author. He had two models; that ancient and simple one of the first Grecian poets, as it is refined by Virgil in the Georgicks, and the familiar epistolary way of Horace. This latter has several advantages: it admits of a greater variety of style; it more readily engages the generality of readers, as partaking more of the air of conversation, and especially with the assistance of rhyme leads to a closer and

more concise expression. Add to this the example of the most perfect of modern poets, who has so happily applied this manner to the noblest parts of philosophy that the publick taste is in a great measure formed to it alone. Yet, after all, the subject before us, tending almost constantly to admiration and enthusiasm, seemed rather to demand a more open, pathetick, and figured style. This too appeared more natural, as the Author's aim was not so much to give formal precepts, or enter into the way of direct argumentation, as by exhibiting the most engaging prospects of nature to enlarge and harmonize the Imagination, and by that means insensibly dispose the minds of men to a similar taste and habit of thinking in religion, morals, and civil life. It is on this account that he is so careful to point out the benevolent intention of the Author of Nature in every principle of the human constitution here insisted on, and also to unite the moral excellencies of life in the same point of view with the mere external objects of good taste; thus recommending them in common to our natural propensity for admiring what is beautiful and lovely. The same views have also led him to introduce some sentiment which may perhaps be looked upon as not quite direct to the subject; but since they bear an obvious relation to it the authority of Virgil, the faultless model of didactick poetry, will best support him in th particular: for the sentiments themselves he make no apology.THE PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION.EPICT. apud Arrian.

Conclusion.WITH what attractive charms this goodly frameOf Nature touches the consenting heartsOf mortal men, and what the pleasing storesWhich beauteous imitation thence derivesTo deck the poet's or the painter's toil,My Verse unfolds. Attend, ye gentle Pow'rsOf Musical delight! and while I singYour gifts, your honours, dance around my strain.Thou, smiling queen of ev'ry tuneful breast,Indulgent Fancy! from the fruitful banksOf Avon, whence thy rosy ingers cullFresh flow'rs and dews to sprinkle on the turf
Where Shakespeare lies, be present; and with theeLet Fiction come, upon her vagrant wingsWafting ten thousand colours thro' the air,Which by the glances of her magick eyeShe blends and shifts at will thro countless forms,Her wild creation. Goddess of the Lyre,Which rules the accents of the moving sphere,Wilt thou, eternal Harmony! descendAnd join this festive train? for with thee comesThe guide the guardian of their lovely sports,Majestick Truth! and where Truth deigns to comeHer sister Liberty will not be far.Be present all ye Genii! who conductThe wand'ring footsteps of the youthful bardNew to your springs and shades, who touch his earWith finer sounds, who heighten to his eyeThe bloom of Nature, and before him turnThe gayest, happiest, attitude of things.Oft' have the laws of each poetick strainThe critick verse employ'd; yet still unsungLay this prime subject, tho' importing mostA Poet's name: for fruitless is th' attemptBy dull obedience and by creeping toilObscure to conquer the severe ascentOf high Parnassus. Nature's kindling breathMust fire the chosen genius; Nature's handMust string his nerves, and imp his eagle wings,Impatient of the painful steep, to soar
High as the summit, there to breathe at largeEthereal air with bards and sages old,Immortal sons of praise! These flatt'ring scenesTo this neglected labour court my song;Yet not unconscious what a doubtful taskTo paint the finest features of the mind,And to most subtle and mysterious thingsGive colour, strength, and motion. But the loveOf Nature and the Muses bids explore,Thro' secret paths erewhile untrod by man,The fair poetick region, to detectUntasted springs, to drink inspiring draughts,And shade my temples with unfading flow'rsCull'd from the laureate vale's profound recess,Where never poet gain'd a wreath before.From Heav'n my strains begin; from Heav'n descendsThe flame of genius to the human breast,And love, and beauty, and poetick joy,And inspiration. Ere the radiant sunSprang from the east, or 'mid the vault of nightThe moon suspended her serener lamp,Ere mountains, woods, or streams, adorn'd the globe,Or Wisdom taught the sons of men her lore,Then liv'd th' Almighty One; then deep-retir'dIn his unsathom'd essence view'd the forms,The forms eternal, of created things;The radiant sun, the moon's nocturnal lamp,The mountains, woods, and streams, therowling globe,
And Wisdom's mien celestial. From the firstOf days on them his love divine he fix'd,His admiration, till in time completeWhat he admir'd and lov'd his vital smileUnfolded into being. Hence the breathOf life informing each organick frame,Hence the green earth and wild resounding waves,Hence light and shade alternate, warmth and cold,And clear autumnal skies and vernal show'rs,And all the fair variety of things.But not alike to ev'ry mortal eyeIs this great scene unveil'd; for since the claimsOf social life to diff'rent labours urgeThe active pow'rs of man, with wise intentThe hand of Nature on peculiar mindsImprints a diff'rent bias, and to eachDecrees its province in the common toil.To some she taught the fabrick of the sphere,The changeful moon, the circuit of the stars,The golden zones of heav'n: to some she gaveTo weigh the moment of eternal things,Of time, and space, and Fate's unbroken chain,And will's quick impulse: others by the handShe led o'er vales and mountains, to exploreWhat healing virtue swells the tender veinsOf herbs and flow'rs, or what the beams of mornDraw forth, distilling from the clifted rindIn balmy tears. But some to higher hopes
Were destin'd; some within a finer mouldShe wrought, and temper'd with a purer flame:To these the Sire Omnipotent unfoldsThe world's harmonious volume, there to readThe transcript of himself. On ev'ry partThey trace the bright impressions of his hand:In earth or air, the meadow's purple stores,The moon's mild radiance, or the virgin's form,Blooming with rosy smiles, they see portray'dThat uncreated beauty which delightsThe mind supreme: they also feel her charmsEnamour'd; they partake th' eternal joy.For as old Memnon's image, long renown'dBy fabling Nilus, to the quiv'ring touchOf Titan's ray with each repulsive stringConsenting founded thro' the warbling airUnbidden strains; ev'n so did Nature's handTo certain species of external thingsAttune the finer organs of the mind:So the glad impulse of congenial pow'rs,Or of sweet sound or fair proportion'd form,The grace of motion, or the bloom of light,Thrills thro' Imagination's tender frameFrom nerve to nerve: all naked and aliveThey catch the spreading rays, till now the soulAt length discloses ev'ry tuneful spring,To that harmonious movement from withoutResponsive. Then the inexpressive strain
Diffuses its enchantment; Fancy dreamsOf sacred fountains, and Elysian groves,And vales of bliss: the intellectual pow'rBends from his awful throne a wond'ring ear,And smiles: the passions, gently sooth'd away,Sink to divine repose, and love and joyAlone are waking; love and joy sereneAs airs that fan the summer. O! attend,Whoe'er thou art whom these delights can touch,Whose candid bosom the refining loveOf Nature warms; O! listen to my Song,And I will guide thee to her fav'rite walks,And teach thy solitude her voice to hear,And point her loveliest features to thy view.Know then, whate'er of Nature's pregnant stores,Whate'er of mimick Art's reflected forms,With love and admiration thus inflameThe pow'rs of fancy, her delighted sonsTo three illustrious orders have referr'd,Three sister Graces whom the painter's hand,The poet's tongue, confesses: the Sublime,The Wonderful, the Fair. I see them dawn!I see the radiant visions where they rise,More lovely than when Lucifer displaysHis beaming foreheed thro' the gates of mornTo lead the train of Phoebus and the spring.Say, why was man so eminently rais'd℣. 151. Say, why was man, &c.] In apologizing for the frequent negligences of the sublimest authors of Greece, " godlike geniuses," says Longinus, "were well assured that Nature had not intended man for a low-spirited or ignoble being, but bringing us into life and the midst of this wide universe as before a multitude assembled at some heroick solemnity that we might be spectators of all her magnificence, and candidates high in emulation for the prize of glory; she has therefore implanted in our souls an inextinguishable love of every thing great and exalted, of every thing which appears divine beyond our comprehension: whence it comes to pass that even the whole world is not an object sufficient for the depth and rapidity of human Imagination, which often sallies forth beyond the limits of all that surrounds us. Let any man cast his eye thro the whole circle of our existence, and consider how especially it abounds in excellent and grand objects, he will soon acknowledge for what enjoyments and pursuits we were destined. Thus by the very propensity of Nature we are led to admire not little springs or shallow rivulets, however clear and delicious, but the Nile, the Rhine, the Danube, and, much more than all, the ocean," &c.Dionys. Longin. de Sublim. sect. xxiv.
Amid the vast creation? why ordain'dThro' life and death to dart his piercing eye,With thoughts beyond the limit of his frame,But that th' Omnipotent might send him forth,In sight of mortal and immortal pow'rs,As on a boundless theatre, to runThe great career of justice, to exaltHis gen'rous aim to all diviner deeds,To chase each partial purpose from his breast,And thro' the mists of passion and of sense,And thro' the tossing tide of chance and pain,To hold his course unfault'ring, while the voiceOf Truth and Virtue up the steep ascent
Of Nature calls him to his high reward,Th' applauding smile of Heav'n? else wherefore burnsIn mortal bosoms this unquenched hopeThat breathes from day to day sublimer things,And mocks possession? wherefore darts the mindWith such resistless ardour to embraceMajestick forms, impatient to be freeSpurning the gross control of wilful might,Proud of the strong contention of her toils,Proud to be daring? Who but rather turnsTo heav'n's broad fire his unconstrained viewThan to the glimm'ring of a waxen flame?Who that from Alpine heights his lab'ring eyeShoots round the wide horizon to surveyNilus or Ganges rowling his bright waveThro' mountains, plains, thro' empires black with shade,And continents of sand, will turn his gazeTo mark the windings of a scanty rillThat murmurs at his feet? The high-born soulDisdains to rest her heav'n-aspiring wingBeneath its native quarry. Tir'd of earthAnd this diurnal scene, she springs aloftThro' fields of air, pursues the flying storm,Rides on the volly'd lightning thro' the heav'ns,Or yok'd with whirlwinds and the northern blastSweeps the long track of day. Then high she soarsThe blue profound, and hov'ring round the SunBeholds him pouring the redundant stream
Of light, beholds his unrelenting swayBend the reluctant planets to absolveThe fated rounds of time: thence far effus'dShe darts her swiftness up the long careerOf devious comets, thro' its burning signsExulting measures the perennial wheelOf Nature, and looks back on all the stars,Whose blended light as with a milky zoneInvests the orient. Now amaz'd she viewsThe empyreal waste, where happy spirits hold℣. 202. The empyreal waste, &c.] "Ne se peut-il point qu'il y a un grand espace au dela de la region des etoiles? Que se soit le ciel empyree, ou non, toujours cet espace immense qui environne toute cette region, pourra etre rempli de bonheur et de gloire. Il pourra etre concu comme l'ocean, ou se rendent les fleuves de toutes les creatures bienheureuses, quand elles seront venues a leur perfection dans le systeme des etoiles." Leibnitz dans la Theodicee, part. I. sect. 19.Beyond this concave heav'n their calm abode,And fields of radiance whose unfading light℣. 204. —whose unfading light, &c.] It was a notion of the great Mr. Huygens that there may be fixed stars at such a distance from our solar system as that their light should not have had time to reach us even from the creation of the world to this day.Has travell'd the profound six thousand years,Nor yet arrives in sight of mortal things.Ev'n on the barriers of the world untir'dShe meditates th' eternal depth below,Till half recoiling down the headlong steepShe plunges, soon o'erwhelm'd and swallow'd up
In that immense of being. There her hopesRest at the fated goal: for from the birthOf mortal man the Sovran Maker saidThat not in humble nor in brief delight,Not in the fading echoes of renown,Pow'rs purple robes nor Pleasure's flow'ry lap,The soul should find enjoyment; but from theseTurning disdainful to an equal goodThro' all th' ascent of things enlarge her view,Till ev'ry bound at length should disappear,And infinite perfection close the scene.Call now to mind what high capacious pow'rsLie folded up in man; how far beyondThe praise of mortals may th' eternal growthOf Nature to perfection half divineExpand the blooming soul: what pity thenShould sloth's unkindly fogs depress to earthHer tender blossom, choke the streams of life,And blast her spring! Far otherwise design'dAlmighty Wisdom; Nature's happy caresTh' obedient heart far otherwise incline;Witness the sprightly joy when aught unknownStrikes the quick sense, and wakes each active pow'rTo brisker measures; witness the neglectOf all familiar prospects, tho' beheld℣. 234. —the neglect—Of all familiar prospects, &c.] It is here said that in consequence of the love of novelty objects which at first were highly delightful to the mind lose that sect by repeated attention to them; but the instance of  is opposed to this observation, for there objects at first distasteful are in time rendered entirely agreeable by repeated attention.The difficulty in this case will be removed if we consider that, when objects at first agreeable lose that influence by frequently recurring, the mind is wholly passive and the perception involuntary; but habit on the other hand generally supposes choice and activity accompanying it; so that the pleasure arises here not from the object but from the mind's conscious determination of its own activity, and consequently increases in proportion to the frequency of that determination.It will still be urged perhaps that a familiarity with disagreeable objects renders them at length acceptable, even when there is no room for the mind to resolve or act at all: in this case the appearance must be accounted for one of these ways:The pleasure from habit may be merely negative. The object at first gave uneasiness; this uneasiness gradually wears off as the object grows familiar; and the mind finding it at last entirely removed, reckons its situation really pleasureable compared with what it had experienced before.The dislike conceived of the object at first might be owing to prejudice or want of attention; consequently the mind being necessitated to review it often may at length perceive its own mistake, and be reconciled to what it had looked on with aversion; in which case a sort of instinctive justice naturally leads it to make amends for the injury by running toward the other extreme of fondness and attachment.Or, lasly, though the object itself should always continue disagreeable, yet circumstances of pleasure or good fortune may occur along with it: thus an association may arise in the mind and the object never be remembered without those pleasing circumstances attending it, by which means the disagreeable impression which it at first occasioned will in time be quite obliterated.
With transport once, the fond attentive gazeOf young Astonishment, the sober zealOf Age commenting on prodigious things.
For such the bounteous providence of Heav'n,In ev'ry breast implanting this desire℣. 240. —this desire—Of objects new and sstrange, &c.] These two ideas are often confounded, though it is evident the mere novelty of an object makes it agreeable, even where the mind is not affected with the least degree of wonder; whereas wonder indeed always implies novelty, being never excited by common or wellknown appearances. But the pleasure in both cases is explicable from the same final cause, the acquisition of knowledge and enlargement of our views of Nature: on this account it is natural to treat of them together.Of objects new and strange, to urge us onWith unremitted labour to pursueThose sacred stores that wait the ripening soulIn Truth's exhaustless bosom. What need wordsTo paint its pow'r? For this the daring youthBreaks from his weeping mother's anxious armsIn foreign climes to rove; the pensive sage,Heedless of sleep or midnight's harmful damp,Hangs o'er the sickly taper; and untir'dThe virgin follows, with enchanted step,The mazes of some wild and wondrous taleFrom morn to eve, unmindful of her form,Unmindful of the happy dress that stoleThe wishes of the youth when ev'ry maidWith envy pin'd. Hence, finally, by nightThe village matron round the blazing hearthSuspends the infant audience with her tales,Breathing astonishment! of witching rhymesAnd evil spirits, of the deathbed call
Of him who robb'd the widow and devour'dThe orphan's portion, of unquiet soulsRis'n from the grave to ease the heavy guiltOf deeds in life conceal'd, of shapes that walkAt dead of night and clank their chains, and waveThe torch of hell around the murd'rer's bed:At ev'ry solemn pause the crowd recoil,Gazing each other speechless, and congeal'dWith shiv'ring sighs till, eager for th' event,Around the beldame all erect they hang,Each trembling heart with grateful terrours quell'd.But lo! disclos'd in all her smiling pomp,Where Beauty onward moving claims the verseHer charms inspire: the freely flowing verseIn thy immortal praise, O form divine!Smooths her mellifluent stream. Thee Beauty! theeThe regal dome and thy enliv'ning rayThe mossy roofs adore: thou, better sun!For ever beamest on th' enchanted heartLove, and harmonious wonder, and delightPoetick. Brightest progeny of Heav'n!How shall I trace thy features? where selectThe roseate hues to emulate thy bloom?Haste then, my Song! thro' Nature's wide expanse,Haste then, and gather all her comeliest wealth,Whate'er bright spoils the florid earth contains,Whate'er the waters or the liquid air,To deck thy lovely labour. Wilt thou fly
With laughing Autumn to th'Atlantick isles,And range with him th' Hesperian field, and seeWhere'er his fingers touch the fruitful groveThe branches shoot with gold, where'er his stepMarks the glad soil the tender clusters growWith purple ripeness, and invest each hillAs with the blushes of an ev'ning sky?Or wilt thou rather stoop thy vagrant plumeWhere gliding thro' his daughter's honour'd shadesThe smooth Peneus from his glassy floodReflects purpureal Tempe's pleasant scene?Fair Tempe! haunt belov'd of sylvan pow'rs,Of Nymphs and Fauns, where in the Golden AgeThey play'd in secret on the shady brinkWith ancient Pan, while round their choral stepsYoung Hours and genial gales with constant handShower'd blossoms, odours, shower'd ambrosial dews,And spring's Elysian bloom. Her flow'ry storeTo thee nor Tempe shall refuse nor watchOf winged Hydra guard Hesperian fruitsFrom thy free spoil. O! bear then unreprov'dThy smiling treasures to the green recessWhere young Dione stays: with sweetest airsEntice her forth to lend her angel formFor Beauty's honour'd image. Hither turnThy graceful footsteps; hither, gentle Maid!Incline thy polish'd forehead: let thy eyesEffuse the mildness of their azure dawn,
And may the fanning breezes waft asideThy radiant locks, disclosing as it bendsWith airy softness from the marble neckThe cheek fair-blooming and the rosy lip,Where winning Smiles and Pleasures sweet as LoveWith sanctity and wisdom temp'ring blendTheir soft allurement: then the pleasing forceOf Nature, and her kind parental care,Worthier I'd sing; then all th' enamour'd youth,With each admiring virgin, to my lyreShould throng attentive, while I point on highWhere Beauty's living image, like the MornThat wakes in Zephyr's arms the blushing May,Moves onward, or as Venus when she stoodEffulgent on the pearly car and smil'dFresh from the deep, and conscious of her form,To see the Tritons tune their vocal shells,And each cerulean sister of the floodWith loud acclaim attend her o'er the wavesTo seck th' Idalian bow'r. Ye smiling bandOf Youths and Virgins! who thro' all the mazeOf young desire with rival steps pursueThis charm of beauty, if the pleasing toilCan yield a moment's respite hither turnYour favourable ear, and trust my words.I do not mean to wake the gloomy formOf Superstition dress'd in Wisdom's garbTo damp your tender hopes; I do not mean
To bid the jealous Thund'rer fire the heav'ns,Or shapes insernal rend the groaning earth,To fright you from your joys: my cheerful SongWith better omens calls you to the field,Pleas'd with your gen'rous ardour in the chase,And warm like you. Then tell me, for ye know,Does Beauty ever deign to dwell where healthAnd active use are strangers? is her charmConfest in aught whose most peculiar endsAre lame and fruitless? or did Nature meanThis pleasing call the herald of a lie,To hide the shame of discord and disease,And catch with fair hypocrisy the heartOf idle Faith? O no! with better caresTh' indulgent mother, conscious how infirmHer offspring tread the paths of good and ill,By this illustrious image, in each kindStill most illustrious where the object holdsIts native pow'rs most perfect, she by thisIllumes the headstrong impulse of Desire,And sanctifies his choice. The gen'rous glebeWhose bosom smiles with verdure, the clear trackOf streams delicious to the thirsty soul,The bloom of nectar'd fruitage ripe to sense,And ev'ry charm of animated things,Are only pledges of a state sincere,Th' integrity and order of their frameWhen all is well within, and ev'ry end
Accomplish'd. Thus was Beauty sent from Heav'nThe lovely ministress of Truth and GoodIn this dark world; for Truth and Good are one,℣. 374. —Truth and Good are one,—And Beauty dweils in them. &c.] "Do you imagine," says Socrates to Aristippus, "that what is good is not beautiful? have you not observed that these appearances always coincide? Virtue, for instance, in the same respect as to which we call it good is ever acknowledged to be beautiful also. In the characters of men we always join the two denominations togetherThis the Athenians did in a peculiar manner by the words .. The beauty of human bodies corresponds in like manner with that economy of parts which constitutes them good, and in every circumstance of life the same object is constantly accounted both beautiful and good, inasmuch as it answers the purposes for which it was designed." Xenoph. Memorab. Socrat. lib. iii. cap. 8.This excellent observation has been illustrated and extended by the noble restorer of ancient philosophy. See The Characteristicks, vol. ii. p. 339 and 422, and vol. iii. p. 181. And another ingenious author has particularly shewn that it holds in the general laws of Nature, in the works of art, and the conduct of the sciences. Inquiry into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue, Treat. i. sect. 8. As to the connexion between beauty and truth, there are two opinions concerning it. Some philosophers assert an independent and invariable law in Nature, in consequence of which "all rational beings must alike perceive beauty in some certain proportions, and deformity in the contrary." And this necessity being supposed the ame with that which commands the assent or dissent of the understanding, it follows of course that beauty is founded on the universal and unchangeable law of truth.But others there are who believe beauty to be merely a relative and arbitrary thing; that indeed it was a benevolent provision in Nature to annex so delightful a sensation to those objects which are best and most perfect in themselves, that so we might be engaged to the choice of them at once, and without having to infer their usefulness from their structure and effects; but that it is not impossible, in a physical sense, that two beings of equal capacities for truth should perceive one of them beauty and the other deformity in the same proportions. And upon this supposition, by that truth which is always connected with beauty, nothing more can be meant than the conformity of any object to those proportions upon which after careful examination the beauty of that species is found to depend. Polycietus, for instance, a famous ancient sculptor, from an accurate mensuration of the several parts of the most perfect human bodies deduced a canon or system of proportions which was the rule of all succeeding artists. Suppose a statue modelled according to this, a man of mere natural taste upon looking at it, without entering into its proportions, confesses and admires its beauty; whereas a professor of the art applies his measures to the head, the neck, or the hand, and without attending to its beauty pronounces the workmanship to be just and true.And Beauty dwells in them and they in her
With like participation: wherefore then,O Sons of Earth! would ye dissolve the tie?O! wherefore with a rash impetuous aimSeek ye those flow'ry joys with which the handOf lavish Fancy paints each flatt'ring sceneWhere Beauty seems to dwell, nor once inquireWhere is the sanction of eternal truth,Or where the seal of undeceitful good,To save your search from folly! Wanting theseLo! Beauty withers in your void embrace,And with the glitt'ring of an idiot's toyDid fancy mock your vows. Nor let the gleamOf youthful hope that shines upon your hearts
Be chill'd or clouded at this awful taskTo learn the lore of undeceitful goodAnd truth eternal. Tho' the pois'nous charmsOf baleful superstition guide the feetOf servile numbers thro' a dreary wayTo their abode, thro' deserts, thorns, and mire,And leave the wretched pilgrim all forlornTo muse at last amid the ghostly gloomOf graves, and hoary vaults, and cloister'd cells,To walk with spectres thro' the midnight shade,And to the screaming owl's accursed songAttune the dreadful workings of his heart,Yet be not ye dismay'd; a gentler starYour lovely search illumines. From the groveWhere Wisdom talk'd with her Athenian sonsCould my ambitious hand intwine a wreathOf Plato's olive with the Mantuan bay,Then should my pow'rful Verse at once dispelThose monkish horrours, then in light divineDisclose th' Elysian prospect, where the stepsOf those whom Nature charms thro' blooming walks,Thro' fragrant mountains and poetick streams,Amid the train of sages, heroes, bards.Led by their winged Genius and the choirOf laurell'd Science and harmonious Art,Proceed exulting to th' eternal shrineWhere Truth conspic'ous with her sister twins,The undivided partners of her sway,With Good and Beauty reigns. O let not us,
Lull'd by luxurious Pleasure's languid strain,Or crouching to the frowns of bigot Rage,O let us not a moment pause to joinThat godlike band! and if the gracious pow'rWho first awaken'd my untutor'd songWill to my invocation breathe anewThe tuneful spirit, then thro' all our pathsNe'er shall the sound of this devoted lyreBe wanting; whether on the rosy mead,When summer smiles, to warn the melting heartOf Luxury's allurement, whether firmAgainst the torrent and the stubborn hillTo urge bold Virtue's unremitted nerve,And wake the strong divinity of soulThat conquers Chance and Fate, or whether struckFor sounds of triumph to proclaim her toilsUpon the lofty summit, round her browTo twine the wreath of incorruptive praise,To trace her hallow'd light thro' future worlds,And bless Heav'n's image in the heart of man.Thus with a faithful aim have we presum'dAdvent'rous to delineate Nature's form,Whether in vast majestick pomp array'd,Or drest for pleasing wonder, or sereneIn Beauty's rosy smile. It now remainsThro' various Being's fair proportion'd scaleTo trace the rising lustre of her charmsFrom their first twilight, shining forth at length
To full meridian splendour. Of degreeThe least and lowliest in th' effusive warmthOf colours mingling with a random blazeDoth Beauty dwell; then higher in the lineAnd variation of determin'd shape,Where Truth's eternal measures mark the boundOf circle, cube, or sphere: the third ascentUnites this vary'd symmetry of partsWith colour's bland allurement, as the pearlShines in the concave of its azure bed,And painted shells indent their speckled wreath.Then more attractive rise the blooming formsThro' which the breath of Nature has infus'dHer genial pow'r to draw with pregnant veinsNutricious moisture from the bounteous earthIn fruit and seed prolisick; thus the flow'rsTheir purple honours with the spring resume,And such the stately tree which autumn bendsWith blushing treasures. But more lovely stillIs Nature's charm where to the full consentOf complicated members, to the bloomOf colour and the vital change of growthLife's holy flame and piercing sense are giv'n,And active motion speaks the temper'd soul:So moves the bird of Juno, so the steedWith rival ardour beats the dusty plain,And faithful dogs with eager airs of joySalute their fellows. Thus doth Beauty dwellThere most conspic'ous, ev'n in outward shape,
Where dawns the high expression of a mind,By steps conducting our enraptur'd searchTo that Eternal Origin whose pow'rThro' all th' unbounded symmetry of things,Like rays effulging from the parent sun,This endless mixture of her charms diffus'd.Mind, mind alone, (bear witness Earth and Heav'nl)The living fountains in itself containsOf beauteous and sublime: here hand in handSit paramount the Graces, here enthron'dCelestical Venus with divinest airsInvites the soul to never fading joy.Look then abroad thro' Nature, to the rangeOf planets, suns, and adamantine spheres,Wheeling unshaken thro' the void immense,And speak, O Man! does this capacious sceneWith half that kindling majesty dilateThy strong conception as when Brutus rose℣. 492. As when Brutus rose, &c.] Cicero himself describes this fact—"Caesare interfecto—statim cruentum alte extollens M. Brutus pugionem, Ciceronem nominatim exclamavit, atque ei recuperatam libertatem est gratulatus." Cic. Philipp. ii. 12.Refulgent from the stroke of Caesar's fateAmid the crowd of patriots, and his armAloft extending, like eternal JoveWhen guilt brings down the thunder, call'd aloudOn Tully's name, and shook his crimson steel,And bad the father of his country Hail!For lo the tyrant prostrate on the dust!
And Rome again is free? Is aught so fairIn all the dewy landscapes of the spring,In the bright eye of Hesper or the Morn,In Nature's fairest forms, is aught so fairAs virtuous friendship? as the candid blushOf him who strives with Fortune to be just?The graceful tear that streams for others' woes?Or the mild majesty of private life,Where Peace with ever-blooming olive crownsThe gate, where Honour's lib'ral hands effuseUnenvy'd treasures, and the snowy wingsOf Innocence and Love protect the scene?Once more search undismay'd the dark profoundWhere Nature works in secret, view the bedsOf mineral treasure, and th' eternal vaultThat bounds the hoary ocean; trace the formsOf atoms moving with incessant changeTheir elemental round, behold the seedsOf being, and the energy of lifeKindling the mass with ever active flame,Then to the secrets of the working MindAttentive turn; from dim oblivion callHer fleet ideal band, and bid them go;Break thro' time's barrier, and o'ertake the hourThat saw the heav'ns created; then declareIf aught were found in those external scenesTo move thy wonder now. For what are allThe forms which brute unconscious matter wears,Greatness of bulk, or symmetry of parts?
Not reaching to the heart soon feeble growsThe superficial impulse; dull their charms,And satiate soon, and pall the languid eye.Not so the moral species, nor the powersOf genius and design: th' ambitious MindThere sees herself; by these congenial formsTouch'd and awaken'd, with intenser actShe bends each nerve, and meditates wellpleas'dHer features in the mirror: for of allThe inhabitants of earth to man aloneCreative Wisdom gave to lift his eyeTo truth's eternal measures, thence to frameThe sacred laws of action and of will,Discerning justice from unequal deeds,And temperance from folly. But beyondThis energy of truth, whose dictates bindAssenting reason, the benignant Sire,To deck the honour'd paths of just and good,Has added bright Imagination's rays,Where Virtue rising from the awful depth℣. 548.

At last the Muses rose, &c.] About the age of Hugh Capet, founder of the third race of French kings, the poets of Provence were in high reputation, a sort of strolling bards or rhapodists, who went about the courts of princes and noblemen entertaining them at festivals with musick and poetry. They attempted both the epick, ode, and satire, and abounded in a wild and fantastick vein of fable, partly allegorical, and partly founded on traditionary legends of the Saracen wars. These were the rudiments of Italian poetry. But their taste and composition must have been extremely barbarous, as we may judge by those who followed the turn of their fable in much politer times, such as Bolardo, Bernardo, Tasso, Ariosto, &c.And wildly warbling scatter'd as they flewTheir blooming wreaths from fair Valclusa's bow'rs℣. 21.

Thus from their guardians torn the tender arts, &c.] Nor were they only losers by the separation; for philosophy itself, to use the words of a noble philosopher, "being thus severed by the sprightly arts and sciences, must consequently grow dronish, insipid, pedantick, useless, and directly opposite to the real knowledge and practice of the world." Insomuch that "a gentleman," says another excellent writer, "cannot easily bring himself to like so austere and ungainly a form; so greatly is it changed from what was once the delight of the finest gentlemen of Antiquity, and their recreation after the hurry of publick affairs!" From this condition it cannot be recovered but by uniting it once more with the works of Imagination; and we have had the pleasure of observing a very great progress made towards their union in England within these few years. It is hardly possible to conceive them at a greater distance from each other than at the Revolution, when Locke stood at the head of one party and Dryden of the other. But the general spirit of liberty which has ever since been growing naturally invited our men of wit and genius to improve that influence which the arts of persuasion gave them with the people, by applying them to subjects of importance to society. Thus poetry and eloquence became considerable, and philosophy is now of course obliged to borrow of their embellishments in order even to gain audience with the publick.Of mimick fancy and harmonious joyTo priestly domination and the lustOf lawless courts their amiable toil

The sweets of senseDo they not oft' with kind accession flowTo raise harmonious Fancy's native charm?So while we taste the fragrance of the roseGlows not her blush the fairer? while we viewAmid the noontide walk a limpid rillGush thro' the trickling herbage, to the thirstOf summer yielding the delicious draughtOf cool refreshment, o'er the mossy brinkShines not the surface clearer, and the wavesWith sweeter musick murmur as they flow?Nor this alone. The various lot of lifeOft' from external circumstance assumesA moment's disposition to rejoiceIn those delights which at a diff'rent hourWould pass unheeded. Fair the face of springWhen rural songs and odours wake the Morn
To ev'ry eye; but how much more to hisRound whom the bed of sickness long diffus'dIts melancholy gloom! how doubly fairWhen first with fresh-born vigour he inhalesThe balmy breeze, and feels the blessed sunWarm at his bosom, from the springs of lifeChasing oppressive damps and languid pain!Or shall I mention where celestial TruthHer awful light discloses, to bestowA more majestick pomp on Beauty's frame?For man loves knowledge, and the beams of truthMore welcome touch his understanding's eyeThan all the blandishments of sound his ear,Than all of taste his tongue. Nor ever yetThe melting rainbow's vernal-tinctur'd huesTo me have shone so pleasing as when firstThe hand of Science pointed out the pathIn which the sunbeams gleaming from the westFall on the wat'ry cloud whose darksome veilInvolves the orient, and that trickling show'rPiercing thro' ev'ry crystalline convexOf clust'ring dewdrops to their flight oppos'dRecoil at length where concave all behindTh' internal surface of each glassy orbRepels their forward passage into airThat thence direct they seek the radiant goalFrom which their course began, and as they strikeIn diff'rent lines the gazer's obvious eye
Assume a diff'rent lustre thro' the bredeOf colours changing from the splendid roseTo the pale violet's dejected hue.Or shall we touch that kind access of joyThat springs to each fair object while we traceThro' all its fabrick Wisdom's artful aimDisposing ev'ry part, and gaining stillBy means proportion'd her benignant end?Speak ye the pure delight whose favour'd stepsThe lamp of Science thro' the jealous mazeOf Nature guides when haply you revealHer secret honours, whether in the sky,The beauteous laws of light, the central pow'rsThat wheel the pensile planets round the year,Whether in wonders of the rowling deep,Or the rich fruits of allsustaining earth,Or fine-adjusted springs of life and sense,Ye scan the counsels of their Author's hand.What, when to raise the meditated sceneThe flame of passion thro' the struggling soulDeep-kindled shows across that sudden blazeThe object of its rapture, vast of size,With fiercer colours and a night of shade?What? like a storm from their capacious bedThe sounding seas o'erwhelming, when the mightOf these eruptions working from the depthOf man's strong apprehension shakes his frameEv'n to the base, from ev'ry naked sense
Of pain or pleasure dissipating allOpinion's feeble cov'rings, and the veilSpun from the cobweb fashion of the timesTo hide the feeling heart? then Nature speaksHer genuine language, and the words of men,Big with the very motion of their souls,Declare with what accumulated forceTh' impetuous nerve of passion urges onThe native weight and energy of things.Ye more her honours: where nor beauty claimsNor shews of good the thirsty sense allureFrom passion's pow'r alone our nature holds℣. 157. From passion's pow'r alone, &c.] This very mysterious kind of Pleasure, which is often found in the exercise of passions generally counted painful, has been taken notice of by several authors. Lucretius resolves it into selflove:
"Suave mari magno," &c.lib. ii. 1.
As if a man was never pleased in being moved at the distress of a tragedy without a cool reflection that though these fictitious personages were so unhappy yet he himself was perfectly at ease and in safety. The ingenious author of the Reflections Critiques sur la Poesie et sur la Peinture, accounts for it by the general delight which the mind takes in its own activity, and the abhorrence it feels of an indolent and inattentive state: and this joined with the moral approbation of its own temper, which attends these emotions when natural and just, is certainly the true foundation of the pleasure, which as it is the origin and basis of tragedy and epick deserved a very particular consideration in this poem.Essential Pleasure. Passion's fierce illapseRouses the mind's whole fabrick, with suppliesOf daily impulse keeps th' elastick pow'rs
Intensely poiz'd, and polishes anew,By that collision, all the fine machine;Else rust would rise, and foulness, by degreesIncumb'ring, choke at last what Heav'n design'dFor ceaseless motion and a round of toil.—But say, does ev'ry passion thus to manAdminister delight? That name indeedBecomes the rosy breath of Love, becomesThe radiant smiles of Joy, th' applauding handOf Admiration; but the bitter show'rThat Sorrow sheds upon a brother's grave,But the dumb palsy of nocturnal Fear,Or those consuming fires that gnaw the heartOf panting Indignation, find we thereTo move delight?—Then listen while my tongueTh' unalter'd will of Heav'n with faithful aweReveals, what old Harmodius wont to teachMy early age; Harmodius! who had weigh'dWithin his learned mind whate'er the schoolsOf Wisdom or thy lonely-whisp'ring voiceO faithful Nature! dictate of the lawsWhich govern and support this mighty frameOf universal being: oft' the hoursFrom morn to eve have stol'n unmark'd awayWhile mute attention hung upon his lips;As thus the sage his awful tale began:"'Twas in the windings of an ancient wood,"When spotless youth with solitude resigns
"To sweet philosophy the studious day,"What time pale Autumn shades the silent eve,"Musing! rov'd. Of good and evil much,"And much of mortal man, my thought revolv'd;"When starting full on Fancy's gushing eye"The mournful image of Parthenia's fate"That hour, O long belov'd and long deplor'd!"When blooming youth nor gentlest Wisdom's arts,"Nor Hymen's honours gather'd for thy brow,"Nor all thy lover's, all thy father's tears,"Avail'd to snatch thee from the cruel grave,"Thy agonizing looks, thy last farewell,"Struck to the inmost feeling of my soul"As with the hand of Death! At once the shade"More horrid nodded o'er me, and the winds"With hoarser murm'ring shook the branchess. Dark"As midnight storms the scene of human things"Appear'd before me; deserts, burning sands,"Where the parch'd adder dies; the frozen south,"And desolation blasting all the west"With rapine and with murder: tyrant Pow'r"Here sits enthron'd with blood; the baleful charms"Of Superstition there infect the skies,"And turn the sun to horrour. Gracious Heav'n!"What is the life of man? or cannot these,"Not these portents, thy awful will suffice?"That propagated thus beyond their scope"They rise to act their crueltie anew
"In my afflicted bosom, thus decreed"The universal sensitive of pain,"The wretched heir of evils not its own!"Thus I impatient; when at once effus'd"A flashing torrent of celestial day"Burst thro' the shadowy void. With slow descent"A purple cloud came floating thro' the sky,"And pois'd at length within the circling trees"Hung obvious to my view, till op'ning wide"Its lucid orb a more than human form"Emerging lean'd majestick o'er my head,"And instant thunder shook the conscious grove;"Then melted into air the liquid cloud,"And all the shining vision stood reveal'd."A wreath of palm his ample forehead bound,"And o'er his shoulder mantling to his knee"Flow'd the transparent robe, around his waist"Collected with a radiant zone of gold"Ethereal; there in mystick signs engrav'd"I read his office high and sacred name,"Genius of Humankind. Appall'd I gaz'd"The godlike presence, for athwart his brow"Displeasure temper'd with a mild concern"Look'd down reluctant on me, and his words"Like distant thunders broke the murm'ring air.""Vain are thy thoughts, O Child of mortal birth!"And impotent thy tongue. Is thy short span"Capacious of this universal frame?
"Thy wisdom allsufficient? Thou, alas!"Dost thou aspire to judge between the Lord"Of Nature and his works? to lift thy voice"Against the sovran order he decreed,"All good and lovely? to blaspheme the bands"Of tenderness innate and social love,"Holiest of things! by which the gen'ral orb"Of being, as by adamantine links,"Was drawn to perfect union, and sustain'd"From everlasting? Hast thou felt the pangs"Of soft'ning sorrow, of indignant zeal,"So grievous to the soul as thence to wish"The ties of Nature broken from thy frame,"That so thy selfish unrelenting heart"Might cease to mourn its lot no longer then"The wretched heir of evils not its own?"O fair benevolence of gen'rous minds!"O man by Nature form'd for all mankind!""He spoke; abash'd and silent I remain'd,"As conscious of my tongue's offence, and aw'd"Before his presence, tho' my secret soul"Disdain'd the imputation. On the ground"I fix'd my eyes, till from his airy couch"He stoop'd sublime, and touching with his hand"My dazzling forehead, "Raise thy sight," he cry'd,"And let thy sense convince thy erring tongue.""I look'd, and lo! the former scene was chang'd,"For verdant alleys and surrounding trees
"A solitary prospect wide and wild"Rush'd on my senses. 'Twas an horrid pile"Of hills with many a shaggy forest mix'd,"With many a sable cliff and glitt'ring stream."Most recumbent o'er the hanging ridge"The brown woods wav'd, while ever-trickling springs"Wash'd from the naked roots of oak and pine"The crumbling soil, and still at ev'ry fail"Down the steep windings of the channell'd rock"Remurm'ring rush'd the congregated floods"With hoarser inundation, till at last"They reach'd a grassy plain which from the skirts"Of that high desert spread her verdant lap,"And drank the gushing moisture, where confin'd"In one smooth current o'er the lilied vale"Clearer than glass it flow'd. Autumnal spoils"Luxuriant spreading to the rays of morn"Blush'd o'er the cliffs, whose half-encircling mound"As in a sylvan theatre enclos'd"That flow'ry level. On the river's brink"I spy'd a fair pavilion, which diffus'd"Its floating umbrage 'mid the silver shade"Of osiers. Now the western sun reveal'd"Between two parting cliffs his golden orb,"And pour'd across the shadow of the hills"On rocks and floods a yellow stream of light"That cheer'd the solemn scene. My list'ning pow'rs"Were aw'd, and ev'ry thought in silence hung
"And wond'ring expectation then the voice"Of that celestial pow'r the mystick show"Declaring, thus my deep attention call'd:""Inhabitant of earth, to whom is giv'n℣. 304. Inhabitant of earth, &c] The account of the nomy of Providence here introduced, as the most  and satisfy the mind when under the compunction  private evils, seems to have come originally from the Pythagorean school; but of the ancient philosophers Plato  largely insisted upon it, has established it with all the  capacious understanding, and ennobled it with  magnificence of his divine imagination. He has one passage  full and clear on this head that I am persuaded the reader  be pleased to see it here tho' somewhat long. Addressing  self to such as are not satisfied concerning divine Provide; "The being who presides over the whole," says he, "posed and complicated all things for the happiness and tue of the whole, every part of which, according to the extent of its influence, does and suffers what is fit and proper. One of these parts is your's, O unhappy man! which  itself most inconsiderable and minute, yet being connected with the universe ever seeks to cooperate with that supreme order. You in the mean-time are ignorant of the very end for which all particular natures are brought into existence, that the all-comprehending nature of the whole may be perfect and happy; existing as it does not for your sake, but the cause and reason of your existence, which, as in the symmetry of every artificial work, must of necessity con with the general design of the artist, and be subservient to the whole, of which it is a part. Your complaint therefore is ignorant and groundless, since according to the v energy of creation and the common laws of Nature there a constant provision of that which is best at the same time for you and for the whole.—For the governing Intelligen clearly beholding all the actions of animated and ving creatures, and that mixture of good and evil which  versifies them, considered first of all by what disposition of things, and by what situation of each individual in the general system, vice might be depressed and subdued, and virtue made secure of victory and happiness, with the greatest facility, and in the highest degree possible: in this manner he ordered through the entire circle of being the internal constitution of every mind, where should be its station in the universal fabrick, and through what variety of circumstances it should proceed in the whole tenour of its existence." He goes on in his sublime manner to assert a future state of retribution, "as well for those who by the exercise of good dispositions being harmonized and assimilated into the divine virtue, are consequently removed to a place of unblemished sanctity and happiness, as of those who by the most flagitious arts have risen from contemptible beginnings to the greatest affluence and power, and whom you therefore look upon as unanswerable instances of negligence in the gods, because you are ignorant of the purposes to which they are subservient, and in what manner they contribute to that supreme intention of good to the whole." Plato de Leg. x. 16.This theory has been delivered of late especially abroad, in a manner which subverts the freedom of human actions; whereas Plato appears very careful to preserve it, and has been in that respect imitated by the best of his followers.
"The gracious ways of Providence to learn,"Receive my sayings with a stedfast ear.—"Know then the Sovran Spirit of the world,"Tho' self-collected from eternal time"Within his own deep essence he beheld"The bounds of true felicity complete,"Yet by immense benignity inclin'd"To spread around him that primeval joy"Which fill'd himself, he rais'd his plastick arm"And sounded thro' the hollow depth of space
"The strong creative mandate; straight arose"These heav'nly orbs, the glad abodes of life"Effusive kindled by his breath divine"Thro' endless forms of being: each inhal'd"From him its portion of the vital flame,"In measure such that from the wide complex"Of coexistent orders one might rise,℣. 321. —one might rise—One order, &c.] See The Meditations of Antoninus, and The Characteristicks, passim."One order, all-involving and entire."He too beholding in the sacred light"Of his essential reason all the shapes"Of swift contingence, all successive ties"Of action propagated thro' the sum"Of possible existence, he at once"Down the long series of eventful time"So fix'd the dates of being, so dispos'd"To ev'ry living soul of ev'ry kind"The field of motion and the hour of rest,"That all conspir'd to his supreme design,"To universal good; with full accord"Answ'ring the mighty model he had chosen,"The best and fairest of unnumber'd worlds℣. 335. The best and fairest, &c.] This opinion is so old that Timaeus Locrus calls the Supreme Being , "The Artificer of that which is best;" and represents him as resolving in the beginning to produce the most excellent work, and as copying the world most exactly from his own intelligible and essential idea; "so that it yet remain, as it was at first, perfect in beauty, and will never stand  need of any correction or improvement." There can be no room for a caution here to understand the expressions not of any particular circumstances of human life separately considered, but of the sum or universal system of life and being.

"That lay from everlasting in the store"Of his divine conceptions. Nor content"By one exertion of creative pow'r"His goodness to reveal, thro' ev'ry age,"Thro' ev'ry moment up the track of time,"His parent hand with ever-new increase"Of happiness and virtue has adorn'd"The vast harmonious frame: his parent hand"From the mute shellfish gasping on the shore"To men, to angels, to celestial minds,"For ever leads the generations on"To higher scenes of being, while supply'd"From day to day with his enliv'ning breath"Inferiour orders in succession rise"To sill the void below. As flame ascends,℣. 350. As flame ascends, &c.] This opinion, though not held by Plato nor any of the Ancients, is yet a very natural cousequence of his principles: but the disquisition is too complex and extensive to be entered upon here."As bodies to their proper centre move,"As the pois'd ocean to th' attracting moon"Obedient swells, and ev'ry headlong stream"Devolves its winding waters to the main,"So all things which have life aspire to God,"The sun of being, boundless, unimpair'd,
"Centre of souls! Nor does the faithful voice"Of Nature cease to prompt their eager steps"Aright, nor is the care of Heav'n withheld"From granting to the task proportion'd aid,"That in their stations all may persevere"To climb th' ascent of being, and approach"For ever nearer to the life divine."That rocky pile thou seest, that verdant lawn,"Fresh water'd from the mountains. Let the scene"Paint in thy fancy the primeval seat"Of man, and where the Will Supreme ordain'd"His mansion, that pavilion fair diffus'd"Along the shady brink, in this recess"To wear th' appointed season of his youth,"Till riper hours should open to his toil"The high communion of superiour minds,"Of consecrated heroes and of gods."Nor did the Sire Omnipotent forget"His tender bloom to cherish, nor withheld"Celestial footsteps from his green abode:"Oft' from the radiant honours of his throne"He sent whom most he lov'd, the Sovran Fair,"The effluence of his glory, whom he plac'd"Before his eyes for ever to behold,"The goddess from whose inspiration flows"The toil of patriots, the delight of friends,"Without whose work divine in heav'n or earth"Nought lovely, nought propitious, comes to pass,
"Nor hope, nor praise, nor honour. Her the Sire"Gave it in charge to reap the blooming mind,"The folded pow'rs to open, to direct"The growth luxuriant of his young desires,"And from the laws of this majestick world"To teach him what was good. As thus the nymph"Her daily care attended, by her side"With constant steps her gay companion stay'd,"The fair Euphrosyne! the gentle queen"Of smiles, and graceful gladness, and delights"That cheer alike the hearts of mortal men"And pow'rs immortal. See the shining Pair!"Behold where from his dwelling now disclos'd"They quit their youthful charge and seek the skies.""I look'd, and on the flow'ry turf there stood"Between two radiant forms a smiling youth"Whose tender cheeks display'd the vernal flow'r"Of beauty, sweetest innocence illum'd"His bashful eyes, and on his polish'd brow"Sat young Simplicity. With fond regard"He view'd th' associates as their steps they mov'd;"The younger chief his ardent eyes detain'd,"With mild regret invoking her return:"Bright as the star of ev'ning she appear'd"Amid the dusky scene: eternal youth"O'er all her form its glowing honours breath'd,"And smiles eternal from her candid eyes"Flow'd like the dewy lustre of the morn
"Effusive trembling on the placid waves:"The spring of heav'n had shed its blushing spoils"To bind her sable tresses; full diffus'd"Her yellow mantle floated in the breeze,"And in her hand she wav'd a living branch"Rich with immortal fruits of pow'r to calm"The wrathful heart, and from the bright'ning eyes"To chase the cloud of sadness. More sublime"The heav'nly partner mov'd: the prime of age"Compos'd her steps: the presence of a god,"High on the circle of her brow enthron'd,"From each majestick motion darted awe,"Devoted awe! till cherish'd by her looks,"Benevolent and meek, confiding love"To filial rapture soften'd all the soul."Free in her graceful hand she pois'd the sword"Of chaste dominion: an heroick crown"Display'd the old simplicity of pomp"Around her honour'd head: a matron's robe"White as the sunshine streams thro' vernal clouds"Her stately form invested. Hand in hand"Th' immortal pair forsook th' enamell'd green,"Ascending slowly: rays of limpid light"Gleam'd round their path; celestial sounds were heard,"And thro' the fragrant air ethereal dews"Distill'd around them, till at once the clouds"Disparting wide in midway sky withdrew"Their airy veil, and left a bright expanse
"Of empyrean flame, where spent and drown'd"Afflicted vision plung'd in vain to scan"What object it involv'd. My feeble eyes"Endur'd not. Bending down to earth I stood"With dumb attention. Soon a female voice,"As wat'ry murmurs sweet or warbling shades,"With sacred invocation thus began:""Father of gods and mortals! whose right arm"With reins eternal guides the moving heav'ns,"Bend thy propitious ear: behold wellpleas'd"I seek to finish thy divine decree."With frequent steps I visit yonder seat"Of man, thy offspring, from the tender seeds"Of justice and of wisdom to evolve"The latent honours of his gen'rous frame,"Till thy conducting hand shall raise his lot"From earth's dim scene to these ethereal walks,"The temple of thy glory. But not me,"Not my directing voice, he oft' requires,"Or hears delighted: this enchanting maid,"Th' associate thou hast giv'n me, her alone"He loves, O Father! absent her he craves;"And but for her glad presence ever join'd"Rejoices not in mine; that all my hopes"This thy benignant purpose to fulfil"I deem uncertain, and my daily cares"Unfruitful all and vain, unless by thee"Still farther aided in the work divine.""She ceas'd; a voice more awful thus reply'd:""O thou! in whom for ever I delight,"Fairer than all th' inhabitants of heav'n,"Best image of thy Author! far from thee"Be disappointment, or distaste, or blame,"Who soon or late shalt ev'ry work fulfil,"And no resistance find. If man refuse"To hearken to thy dictates, or allur'd"By meaner joys to any other pow'r"Transfer the honours due to thee alone,"That joy which he pursues he ne'er shall taste,"That pow'r in whom delighteth ne'er behold."Go then once more, and happy be thy toil;"Go then, but let not this thy smiling friend"Partake thy footsteps. In her stead, behold"With thee the son of Nemesis I send,"The fiend abhorr'd! whose vengeance takes account"Of sacred Order's violated laws."See where he calls thee, burning to be gone,"Fierce to exhaust the tempest of his wrath"On yon' devoted head. But thou, my Child!"Control his cruel phrensy, and protect"Thy tender charge, that when despair shall grasp"His agonizing bosom he may learn,"Then he may learn, to love the gracious hand"Alone sufficient in the hour of ill"To save his feeble spirit; then confess"Thy genuine honours, O excelling Fair!
"When all the plagues that wait the deadly will"Of this avenging demon, all the storms"Of night infernal, serve but to display"Th' energy of thy superiour charms"With mildest awe triumphant o'er his rage,"And shining clearer in the horrid gloom.""Here ceas'd that awful voice, and soon I felt"The cloudy curtain of refreshing eve"Was clos'd once more, from that immortal fire"Shelt'ring my eyelids. Looking up I view'd"A vast gigantick spectre striding on"Thro' murm'ring thunders and a waste of clouds"With dreadful action. Black as night his brow"Relentless frowns involv'd: his savage limbs"With sharp impatience violent he writh'd"As thro' convulsive anguish; and his hand,"Arm'd with a scorpion lash, full oft' he rais'd"In madness to his bosom; while his eyes"Rain'd bitter tears, and bellowing loud he shook"The void with horrour. Silent by his side"The virgin came; no discomposure stirr'd"Her features; from the glooms which hung around"No stain of darkness mingled with the beam"Of her divine effulgence. Now they stoop"Upon the river bank, and now to hail"His wonted guests with eager steps advanc'd"The unsuspecting inmate of the shade."As when a famish'd wolf that all night long
"Had rang'd the Alpine snows by chance at morn"Sees from a cliff incumbent o'er the smoke"Of some lone village a neglected kid"That strays along the wild for herb or spring,"Down from the winding ridge he sweeps amain,"And thinks he tears him; so with tenfold rage"The monster sprung remorseless on his prey."Amaz'd the stripling stood; with panting breast"Feebly he pour'd the lamentable wail"Of helpless consternation, struck at once"And rooted to the ground. The queen beheld"His terrour, and with looks of tend'rest care"Advanc'd to save him. Soon the tyrant felt"Her awful pow'r: his keen tempest'ous arm"Hung nerveless, nor descended where his rage"Had aim'd the deadly blow, then dumb retir'd"With sullen rancour. Lo! the sovran maid"Folds with a mother's arms the fainting boy"Till life rekindles in his rosy cheek,"Then grasps his hands and cheers him with her tongue."O wake thee, rouse thy spirit! shall the spite"Of yon' tormentor thus appal thy heart"While I thy friend and guardian am at hand"To rescue and to heal? O let thy soul"Remember what the will of Heav'n ordains"Is ever good for all, and if for all"Then good for thee. Nor only by the warmth"And soothing sunshine of delightful things
"Do minds grow up and flourish. Oft' misled"By that bland light the young unpractis'd views"Of reason wander thro' a fatal road,"Far from their native aim, as if to lie"Inglorious in the fragrant shade, and wait"The soft access of ever-circling joys,"Were all the end of being. Ask thyself,"This pleasing errour did it never lull"Thy wishes? has thy constant heart refus'd"The silken fetters of delicious ease?"Or when divine Euphrosyne appear'd"Within this dwelling, did not thy desires"Hang far below the measure of thy fate"Which I reveal'd before thee? and thy eyes"Impatient of my counsels turn away"To drink the soft effusion of her smiles?"Know then for this the Everlasting Sire"Deprives thee of her presence, and instead,"O wise and still benevolent! ordains"This horrid visage hither to pursue"My steps, that so thy nature may discern"Its real good, and what alone can save"Thy feeble spirit in this hour of ill"From folly and despair. O yet belov'd!"Let not this headlong terrour quite o'erwhelm"Thy scatter'd pow'rs, nor fatal deem the rage"Of this tormentor, nor his proud assault,"While I am here to vindicate thy toil,
"Above the gen'rous question of thy arm."Brave by thy fears, and in thy weakness strong,"This hour he triumphs; but confront his might"And dare him to the combat, then, with ease"Disarm'd and quell'd, his fierceness he resigns"To bondage and to scorn; while thus inur'd,"By watchful danger, by unceasing toil,"Th' immortal mind superiour to his fate,"Amid the outrage of external things"Firm as the solid base of this great world,"Rests on his own foundations. Blow ye Winds!"Ye Waves! ye Thunders! rowl your tempest on,"Shake ye old Pillars of the marble sky!"Till all its orbs and all its worlds of fire"Be loosen'd from their seats; yet still serene"Th' unconquer'd mind looks down upon the wreck,"And ever stronger as the storms advance"Firm thro' the closing ruin holds his way"Where Nature calls him, to the destin'd goal.""So spake the goddess, while thro' all her frame"Celestial raptures low'd, in ev'ry word,"In ev'ry motion, kindling warmth divine"To seize who listen'd. Vehement and swift"As lightning fires th' aromatick shade"In Ethiopian fields the stripling felt"Her inspiration catch his fervid soul,"And starting from his languor thus exclaim'd:""Then let the trial come! and witness thou
"If terrour be upon me, if I shrink"To meet the storm, or faulter in my strength"When hardest it besets me. Do not think"That I am fearful and infirm of soul,"As late thy eyes beheld, for thou hast chang'd"My nature; thy commanding voice has wak'd"My languid pow'rs to bear me boldly on"Where'er the will divine my path ordains"Thro' toil or peril; only do not thou"Forsake me: O! be thou for ever near,"That I may listen to thy sacred voice,"And guide by thy decrees my constant feet."But say, for ever are my eyes beret?"Say, shall the fair Euphrosyne not once"Appear again to charm me? Thou in heav'n,"O thou Eternal Arbiter of things!"Be thy great bidding done; for who am I"To question thy appointment? Let the frowns"Of this avenger ev'ry morn o'ercast"The cheerful dawn, and ev'ry ev'ning damp"With double night my dwelling; I will learn"To hail them both, and unrepining bear"His hateful presence; but permit my tongue"One glad request, and if my deeds may find"Thy awful eye propitious, O restore"The rosy-featur'd maid again to cheer"This lonely eat, and bless me with her smiles!""He spoke; when instant thro' the sable glooms
"With which that furious presence had involv'd"The ambient air a flood of radiance came"Swift as the lightning flash; the melting clouds"Flew diverse, and amid the blue serene"Euphrosyne appear'd. With sprightly step"The nymph alighted on th' irrig'ous lawn,"And to her wond'ring audience thus began:""Lo! I am here to answer to your vows,"And be the meeting fortunate! I come"With joyful tidings; we shall part no more.—"Hark how the gentle Echo from her cell"Talks thro' the cliffs, and murm'ring o'er the stream"Repeats the accents, We shall part no more!"O my delightful Friends! wellpleas'd on high"The Father has beheld you while the might"Of that stern foe with bitter trial prov'd"Your equal doings; then for ever spake"The high decree, that thou, celestial Maid!"Howe'er that grisly phantom on thy steps"May sometimes dare intrude, yet never more"Shalt thou descending to th' abode of man"Alone endure the rancour of his arm,"Or leave thy lov'd Euphrosyne behind.""She ended, and the whole romantick scene"Immediate vanish'd; rocks, and woods, and rills,"The mantling tent, and each mysterious form"Flew like the pictures of a morning dream"When sunshine fills the bed. A while I stood
"Perplex'd and giddy, till the radiant pow'r"Who bad the visionary landscape rise,"As up to him I turn'd with gentlest looks,"Preventing my inquiry thus began:""There let thy soul acknowledge its complaint"How blind, how impious! there behold the ways"Of Heav'n's eternal destiny to man"For ever just, benevolent, and wise,"That Virtue's awful steps, howe'er pursu'd"By vexing Fortune and intrusive Pain,"Should never be divided from her chaste,"Her fair, attendant Pleasure. Need I urge"Thy tardy thought thro' all the various round"Of this existence, that thy soft'ning soul"At length may learn what energy the hand"Of Virtue mingles in the bitter tide"Of passion swelling with distress and pain,"To mitigate the sharp with gracious drops"Of cordial pleasure? Ask the faithful youth"Why the cold urn of her whom long he lov'd"So often fills his arms, so often draws"His lonely footsteps at the silent hour"To pay the mournful tribute of his tears?"O! he will tell thee that the wealth of worlds"Should ne'er seduce his bosom to forego"That sacred hour when, stealing from the noise"Of care and envy, sweet remembrance sooths"With Virtue's kindest looks his aking breast,

Concluding with an account of the natural and moral advantages resulting from a sensible and wellformed Imagination.WHAT wonder therefore since th' endearing tiesOf passion link the universal kindOf man so close, what wonder if to searchThis common nature thro' the various changeOf sex, and age, and fortune, and the frameOf each peculiar, draw the busy mindWith unresisted charms? The spacious westAnd all the teeming regions of the southHold not a quarry to the curious flightOf knowledge half so tempting or so fairAs man to man; nor only where the smilesOf love invite, nor only where th' applauseOf cordial honour turns th' attentive eyeOn Virtue's graceful deeds; for since the course
Of things external acts in diff'rent waysOn human apprehensions, as the handOf Nature temper'd to a diff'rent framePeculiar minds, so haply where the pow'rs℣. 18. —where the pow'rs—Of fancy, &c.] The influence of the Imagination on the conduct of life is one of the most important points in moral philosophy. It were easy by an induction of facts to prove that the Imagination directs almost all the passions, and mixes with almost everycircumstance of action or pleasure. Let any man, even of the coldest head and soberest industry, analyze the idea of what he calls his Interest, he will find that it consists chiefly of certain degrees of decency, beauty, and order, variously combined into one system, the idol which he seeks to enjoy by labour, hazard, and selfdenial. It is on this account of the last consequence to regulate these images by the standard of Nature and the general good, otherwise the Imagination, by heightening some objects beyond their real excellence and beauty, or by representing others in a more odious or terrible shape than they deserve, may of course engage us in pursuits utterly inconsistent with the moral order of things.If it be objected that this account of things supposes the passions to be merely accidental, whereas there appears in some a natural and hereditary disposition to certain passions, prior to all circumstances of education or fortune, it may be answered, that though no man is born ambitious or a miser, yet he may inherit from his parents a peculiar temper or complexion of mind which shall render his Imagination more liable to be struck with some particular objects, consequently dispose him to form opinions of good and ill, and entertain passions of a particular turn. Some men, for instance, by the original frame of their minds are more delighted with the vast and magnificent, others, on the contrary, with the elegant and gentle aspects of Nature: and it is very remarkable that the disposition of the moral powers is always similar to this of the Imagination; that those who are most inclined to admire prodigious and sublime objects in the physical world are also most inclined to applaud examples of fortitude and heroick virtue in the moral; while those who are charmed rather with the delicacy and sweetness of colours, and forms, and sounds, never fail, in like manner, to yield the preference to the softer scenes of virtue and the sympathies of a domestick life. And this is sufficient to account for the objection.Among the ancient philosophers though we have several hints concerning this influence of the Imagination upon morals among the remains of the Socratick school, yet the Stoicks were the first who paid it a due attention. Zeno their founder thought it impossible to preserve any tolerable regularity in life without frequently inspecting those pictures or appearances of things which the Imagination offers to the mind. Diog. Laert. l. vii. The Meditations of M. Aurelius, and The Discourses of Epictetus, are full of the same sentiment, insomuch that the latter makes the , or "right management of the fancies," the only thing for which we are accountable to Providence, and without which a man is no other than stupid or frantick. Arrian. l. i. c. 12. and l. ii. c. 22. See also The Characteristicks, vol. I. from p. 313 to 321. where this stoical doctrine is embellished with all the elegance and graces of Plato.Of fancy neither lessen nor enlarge
The images of things, but paint in allTheir genuine hues the features which they woreIn Nature, there opinion will be trueAnd action right; for Action treads the pathIn which Opinion says he follows goodOr flies from evil; and Opinion givesReport of good or evil as the sceneWas drawn by Fancy, lovely or deform'd:Thus her report can never there be true
Where Fancy cheats the intellectual eyeWith glaring colours and distorted lines.Is there a man who at the sound of deathSees ghastly shapes of terrour conjur'd upAnd black before him, nought but deathbed groansAnd fearful pray'rs, and plunging from the brinkOf light and being down the gloomy airAn unknown depth? Alas! in such a mindIf no bright forms of excellence attendThe image of his country, nor the pompOf sacred senates, nor the guardian voiceOf Justice on her throne, nor aught that wakesThe conscious bosom with a patriot's flame,Will not Opinion tell him that to dieOr stand the hazard is a greater illThan to betray his country? and in actWill he not chuse to be a wretch and live?Here vice begins then. From th' enchanting cupWhich Fancy holds to all th' unwary thirstOf youth oft' swallows a Circean draughtThat sheds a baleful tincture o'er the eyeOf Reason, till no longer he discerns,And only guides to err; then revel forthA furious band that spurn him from the throne,And all is uproar. Thus Ambition graspsThe empire of the soul; thus pale RevengeUnsheaths her murd'rous dagger; and the handsOf Lust and Rapine with unholy arts
Watch to o'erturn the barrier of the lawsThat keeps them from their prey: thus all the plaguesThe wicked bear, or o'er the trembling sceneThe Tragick Muse discloses, under shapesOf honour, safety, pleasure, ease, or pomp,Stole first into the mind. Yet not by allThose lying forms which Fancy in the brainEngenders are the kindling passions driv'nTo guilty deeds, nor Reason bound in chains,That Vice alone may lord it: oft' adorn'dWith solemn pageants Folly mounts the throne,And plays her idiot anticks like a queen.A thousand garbs she wears, a thousand waysShe wheels her giddy empire.—Lo! thus farWith bold adventure to the Mantuan lyreI sing of Nature's charms, and touch wellpleas'dA stricter note: now haply must my songUnbend her serious measure, and revealIn lighter strains how Folly's awkward arts℣. 75. —how Folly's awkward arts, &c.] Notwithstanding the general influence of ridicule on private and civil life, as well as on learning and the sciences, it has been almost constantly neglected or misrepresented, by divines especially. The manner of treating these subjects in the science of human nature should be precisely the same as in natural philosophy, from particular facts to investigate the stated order in which they appear, and then apply the general law thus discovered to the explication of other appearances and the improvement of useful arts.
Excite impetuous Laughter's gay rebuke,The sportive province of the Comick Muse.See in what crowds the uncouth forms advance!Each would outstrip the other, each preventOur careful search, and offer to your gazeUnask'd his motley features. Wait a whileMy curious Friends! and let us first arrangeIn proper order your promisc'ous throng.Behold the foremost band, of slender thought℣. 84. Behold the foremost band, &c.] The first and most general source of ridicule in the characters of men is vanity or selfapplause for some desirable quality or possession which evidently does not belong to those who assume it.And easy faith, whom flatt'ring Fancy soothsWith lying spectres, in themselves to viewIllustrious forms of excellence and good,That scorn the mansion. With exulting heartsThey spread their spurious treasures to the sun,And bid the world admire! but chief the glanceOf wishful Envy draws their joy-bright eyes,And lifts with selfapplause each lordly brow.In number boundless as the blooms of springBehold their glaring idols, empty shadesBy Fancy gilded o'er, and then set upFor adoration: some in Learning's garb,With formal band, and sable-cinctur'd gown,And rags of mouldy volumes; some, elateWith martial splendour, steely pikes and swordsOf costly frame, and gay Phoenician robes
Inwrought with flow'ry gold, assume the portOf stately Valour; list'ning by his sideThere stands a female form; to her with looksOf earnest import, pregnant with amaze,He talks of deadly deeds, of breaches, storms,And sulph'rous mines, and ambush! then at onceBreaks off, and smiles to see her look so pale,And asks some wond'ring question of her fears!Others of graver mien; behold adorn'dWith holy ensigns how sublime they move,And bending oft' their sanctimonious eyesTake homage of the simple-minded throng;Ambassadors of Heav'n! nor much unlikeIs he whose visage in the lazy mistThat mantles ev'ry feature hides a broodOf politick conceits, of whispers, nods,And hints deep omen'd with unwieldy schemes,And dark portents of state! Ten thousand moreProdigious habits and tumult'ous tonguesPour dauntless in and swell the boastful band.Then comes the second order, all who seek℣. 121. Then comes the second order, &c.] Ridicule from the same vanity, where though the possession be real yet no merit can arise from it, because of some particular circumstances which, though obvious to the spectator, are yet overlooked by the ridiculous character.The debt of praise, where watchful UnbeliefDarts thro' the thin pretence her squinting eyeOn some retir'd appearance which belies
The boasted virtue, or annuls th' applauseThat Justice else would pay. Here side by sideI see two leaders of the solemn trainApproaching, one a female old and grey,With eyes demure and wrinkle-furrow'd brow,Pale as the cheeks of Death; yet still she stunsThe sick'ning audience with a nauseus tale:How many youths her myrtle-chains have worn,How many virgins at her triumphs pin'd!Yet how resolv'd she guards her cautious heart!Such is her terrour at the risks of loveAnd man's seducing tongue! the other seemsA bearded sage, ungentle in his mien,And sordid all his habit; peevish WantGrins at his heels, while down the gazing throngHe stalks, resounding in magnisick praiseThe vanity of riches, the contemptOf pomp and pow'r. Be prudent in your zealYe grave Associates! let the silent graceOf her who blushes at the fond regardHer charms inspire more eloquent unfoldThe praise of spotless honour: let the manWhose eye regards not his illustrious pompAnd ample store but as indulgent streamsTo cheer the barren soil and spread the fruitsOf joy, let him by juster measures fixThe price of riches and the end of pow'r.Another tribe succeeds; deluded long℣. 152. Another tribe suceeds, &c.] Ridicule from a notion of exence in particular objects disproportioned to their intrinsick value, and inconsistent wth the order of Nature.By Fancy's dazzling opticks these beholdThe images of some peculiar thingsWith brighter hues resplendent, and portray'dWith features nobler far than e'er adorn'dTheir genuine objects: hence the fever'd heartPants with delirious hope for tinsel charms,Hence oft' obtrusive on the eye of ScornUntimely Zeal her witless pride betrays,And serious Manhood from the tow'ring aimOf Wisdom stoops to emulate the boastOf childish Toil. Behold yon' mystick formBedeck'd with feathers, insects, weeds, and shells!Not with intenser view the Samian sageBent his fixt eye on heav'n's intenser fires,When first the order of that radiant sceneSwell'd his exulting thought, than this surveysA muckworm's entrails or a spider's fang.Next him a youth with flow'rs and myrtles crown'dAttends that virgin form, and blushing kneels,With fondest gesture and a suppliat's tongue,To win her coy regard. Adieu for himThe dull engagements of the bustling world!Adieu the sick impertinence of praise,And hope and action! for with her alone
By streams and shades to steal these sighing hoursIs all he asks, and all that Fate can give!Thee too, facetious Momion! wand'ring here,Thee, dreaded Censor! oft' have I beheldBewilder'd unawares: alas! too longFlush'd with thy comick triumphs and the spoilsOf sly Derision! till on ev'ry sideHurling thy random bolts offended TruthAssign'd thee here thy station with the slavesOf Folly. Thy once formidable nameShall grace her humble records, and be heardIn scoffs and mock'ry bandy'd from the lipsOf all the vengeful brotherhood around,So oft' the patient victims of thy scorn.But now ye Gay! to whom indulgent Fate℣. 191. But now ye Gay! &c.] Ridicule from a notion of excellence, when the object is absolutely odious or contemptible. This is the highest degree of the ridiculous, as in the atation of diseases or vices.Of all the Muses' empire hath assign'dThe fields of folly, hither each advanceYour sickles; here the teeming soil affordsIts richest growth. A fav'rite brood appears,In whom the demon with a mother's joyViews all her charms reflected, all her caresAt full repaid. Ye most illustr'ous Band!Who, scorning Reason's tame pedantick rulesAnd Order's vulgar bondage, never meantFor souls sublime as yours, with gen'rous zeal
Pay Vice the rev'rence Virtue long usurp'd,And yield Deformity the fond applauseWhich Beauty wont to claim, forgive my song,That for the blushing diffidence of youthIt shuns th' unequal province of your praise.Thus far triumphant in the pleasing guile℣. 207. Thus far triumphant, &c.] Ridicule from false shame or groundless fear.Of bland Imagination Folly's trainHave dar'd our search; but now a dastard kindAdvance reluctant, and with falt'ring feetShrink from the gazer's eye: enfeebled hearts!Whom Fancy chills with visionary fears,Or bends to servile tameness with conceitsOf shame, of evil, or of base defect,Fantastick and delusive. Here the slaveWho droops abash'd when sullen Pomp surveysHis humbler habit; here the trembling wretch,Unnerv'd and struck with Terrour's icy bolts,Spent in weak wailings, drown'd in shameful tears,At ev'ry dream of danger; here, subdu'dBy frontless Laughter and the hardy scornOf old unfeeling Vice, the abject soulWho, blushing, half resigns the candid praiseOf temp'rance and honour, half disownsA freeman's hatred of tyrannick pride,And hears with sickly smiles the venal mouthWith foulest licence mock the patriot's name.Last of the motley bands on whom the pow'r℣. 228. Last of the, &c.] Ridicule from the ignorance of such things as our circumstances require us to know.Of gay Derision bends her hostile aimIs that where shameful Ignorance presides.Beneath her sordid banners, lo! they marchLike blind and lame. Whate'er their doubtful handsAttempt Confusion straight appears behindAnd troubles all the work. Thro' many a mazePerplex'd they struggle, changing ev'ry path,O'erturning ev'ry purpose, then at lastSit down dismay'd, and leave th' entangled sceneFor Scorn to sport with. Such then is th' abodeOf Folly in the mind, and such the shapesIn which she governs her obsequious train.Thro' ev'ry scene of ridicule in thingsTo lead the tenour of my devious lay,Thro ev'ry swift occasion which the handOf Laughter points at when the mirthful stingDistends her sallying nerves and chokes her tongue,What were it but to count each crystal dropWhich Morning's dewy fingers on the bloomsOf May distil? Suffice it to have said℣. 248. —Suffice it to have said &c.] By comparing these general sources of ridicule with each other, and examining the ridiculous in other objects, we may obtain a general detion of it equally applicable to every species. The most important circumstance of this deition is laid down in the lines referred to, but others more minute we shall subjoin here. Aristotle's account of the matter seems both imperfect and false; , says he, : "The ridiculous is some certain fault or turpitude without pain, and not destructive to its subject." Poet. c. 5. For allowing it to be true, as it is not, that the ridiculous is never accompanied with pain, yet we might produce many instances of such a fault or turpitude which cannot with any tolerable propriety be called ridiculous, so that the definition does not distinguish the thing designed. Nay, farther, even when we perceive the turpitude tending to the destruction of its subject we may still be sensible of a ridiculous appearance till the ruin become imminent, and the keener sensations of pity or terrour banish the ludicrous apprehension from our minds; for the sensation of ridicule is not a bare perception of the agreement or disagreement of ideas, but a passion or emotion of the mind consequential to that perception; so that the mind may perceive the agreement or disagreement, and yet not feel the ridiculous, because it is engrossed by a more violent emotion. Thus it happens that some men think those objects ridiculous to which others cannot endure to apply the name, because in them they excite a much intenser and more important feeling: and this difference, among other causes, has brought a good deal of confusion into this question."That which makes objects ridiculous is some ground of admiration or esteem connected with other more general circumstances comparatively worthless or deformed; or it is some circumstance of turpitude or deformity connected with what is in general excellent or beautiful; the inconsistent properties existing either in the objects themselves, or in the apprehension of the person to whom they relate, belonging always to the same order or class of being, implying sentiment or design, and exciting no acute or vehement emotion of the heart."To prove the several parts of this definition: "The appearance of excellence or beauty connected with a general condition comparatively sordid or deformed" is ridiculous: for instance, pompous pretensions of wisdom, joined with ignorance or folly, in the Socrates of Aristophanes, and the ostentations of military glory with cowardice and stupidity, in the Thraso of Terence."The appearance of deformity or turpitude in conjunction with what is in general excellent or venerable" is also ridiculous: for instance, the personal weaknesses of a magistrate appearing in the solemn and publick functions of his station."The incongruous properties may either exist in the objects themselves, or in the apprehension of the person to whom they relate:" in the last mentioned instance they both exist in the objects; in the instances from Aristophanes and Terence one of them is objective and real, the other only ounded in the apprehension of the ridiculous character."The inconsistent properties must belong to the same order or class of being." A coxcomb in fine clothes bedaubed by accident in foul weather is a ridiculous object; because his general apprehension of excellence and esteem is referred to the splendour and expense of his dress. A man of sense and merit in the same circumstances is not counted ridiculous, because the general ground of excellence and esteem in him is, both in fact and in his own apprehension, of a very different species."Every ridiculous object implies sentiment or design." A column placed by an architect without a capital or base is laughed at; the same column in a ruin causes a very different sensation.And, lastly, "the occurrence must excite no acute or vehement emotion of the heart," such as terrour, pity, or indignation; for in that case, as was observed above, the mind is not at leisure to contemplate the ridiculous.Whether any appearance not ridiculous be involved in this description, and whether it comprehend every species and form of the ridiculous, must be determined by repeated applications of it to particular instances.
Where'er the pow'r of Ridicule displaysHer quaint-ey'd visage some incongr'ous form,
Some stubborn dissonance of things combin'd,Strikes on the quick observer, whether Pomp,
Or Praise, or Beauty, mix their partial claim,Where sordid fashions, where ignoble deeds,Where foul Deformity, are wont to dwell,Or whether these with violation loth'dInvade resplendent Pomp's imperious mien,The charms of Beauty or the boast of Praise.Ask we for what fair end th'Almighty Sire℣. 259. Ask we for what fair end, &c.] Since it is beyond all contradiction evident that we have a natural sense or feeling of the ridiculous, and since so good a reason may be assigned to justify the Supreme Being for bestowing it, one cannot without astonishment reflect on the conduct of those men who imagine it is for the service of true religion to vilify and blacken it without distinction, and endeavour to persuade us that it is never applied but in a bad cause. Ridicule is not concerned with mere speculative truth or falsehood. It is not in abstract propositions or theorems, but in actions and passions, good and evil, beauty and deformity, that we find materials for it; and all these terms are relative, implying approbation or blame. To ask them whether ridicule be a test of truth is, in other words, to ask whether that which is ridiculous can be morally true, can be just and becoming; or whether that which is just and becoming can be ridiculous: a question that does not deserve a serious answer; for it is most evident that, as in a metaphysical proposition offered to the understanding for its assent, the faculty of reason examines the terms of the proposition, and finding one idea which was supposed equal to another to be in fact unequal, of consequence rejects the proposition as a falsehood: so in objects offered to the mind for its esteem or applause the faculty of ridicule finding an incongruity in the claim urges the mind to reject it with laughter and contempt. When therefore we observe such a claim obtruded upon mankind, and the inconsistent circumstances carefully concealed from the eye of the publick, it is our business, if the matter be of importance to society, to drag out those latent circumstances, and by setting them in full view to convince the world how ridiculous the claim is: and thus a double advantage is gained, for we both detect the moral falsehood sooner than in the way of speculative inquiry, and impress the minds of men with a stronger sense of the vanity and errour of its authors. And this and no more is meant by the application of ridicule.But it is said the practice is dangerous, and may be inconsistent with the regard we owe to objects of real dignity and excellence. I answer, the practice fairly managed can never be dangerous: men may be dishonest in obtruding circumstances foreign to the object, and we may be inadvertent in allowing those circumstances to impose upon us; but the sense of ridicule always judges right. The Socrates of Aristophanes is as truly ridiculous a character as ever was drawn:—true; but it is not the character of Socrates, the divine moralist, and father of ancient wisdom. What then? did the ridicule of the poet hinder the philosopher from detecting and disclaiming those foreign circumstances which he had falsely introduced into his character, and thus rendered the sat doubly ridiculous in his turn? No; but it nevertheless had an ill influence on the minds of the people. And so has the reasoning of Spinoza made many Atheists: he has founded it indeed on suppositions utterly false; but allow him these and his conclusions are unavoidably true. And if we must reject the use of ridicule because by the imposition of false circumstances things may be made to seem ridiculous which are not so in themselves, why we ought not in the same manner to reject the use of reason, because by proceeding on false principles conclusions will appear true which are impossible in nature, let the vehement and obstinate declaimers against ridicule determine.
In mortal bosoms wakes this gay contempt,These grateful stings of laughter, from disgustEducing pleasure? Wherefore but to aid
The tardy steps of Reason, and at onceBy this prompt impulse urge us to depressThe giddy aims of Folly? Tho' the lightOf truth slow dawning on th' inquiring mindAt length unfolds thro' many a subtle tieHow these uncouth disorders end at lastIn publick evil, yet benignant Heav'n;Conscious how dim the dawn of truth appearsTo thousands, conscious what a scanty pauseFrom labours and from care the wider lotOf humble life affords for studious thoughtTo scan the maze of Nature, therefore amp'dThe glaring scenes with characters of scornAs broad, as obvious, to the passing clownAs to the letter'd sage's curious eye.Such are the various aspects of the mind.—Some heav'nly genius whose unclouded thoughtsAttain that secret harmony which blendsTh' ethereal spirit with its mould of clay,O! teach me to reveal the grateful charmThat searchless Nature o'er the sense of manDiffuses, to behold in lifeless thingsThe inexpressive semblance of himself,℣. 285. The inexpressive semblance, &c.] This similitude is the foundation of almost all the ornaments of poetick diction.Of thought and passion; mark the sable woodsThat shade sublime yon' mountain's nodding brow;
With what religious awe the solemn sceneCommands your steps! as if the rev'rend formOf Minos or of Numa should forsakeTh' Elysian seats and down th' embow'ring gladeMove to your pausing eye! behold th' expanseOf yon' gay landscape, where the silver cloudsFlit o'er the heav'ns before the sprightly breeze;Now their grey cincture skirts the doubtful sun,Now streams of splendour thro' their op'ning veilEffulgent sweep from off the gilded lawnTh' aerial shadows on the curling brookAnd on the shady margin's quiv'ring leavesWith quickest lustre glancing: while you viewThe prospect, say, within your cheerful breastPlays not the lively sense of winning MirthWith clouds and sunshine checker'd, while the roundOf social converse to th' inspiring tongueOf some gay nymph amid her subject trainMoves all obsequious? Whence is this effect,This kindred pow'r of such discordant things?Or flows their semblance from that mystick toneTo which the newborn mind's harmonious pow'rsAt first were strung? or rather from the linksWhich artful Custom twines around her frame?For when the diff'rent images of thingsBy Chance combin'd have struck th' attentive soulWith deeper impulse, or connected longHave drawn her frequent eye, howe'er distinct

Let the mindRecall one partner of the various league,Immediate, lo! the firm confed'rates rise,And each his former station straight resumes,One movement governs the consenting throng,And all at once with rosy pleasure shine,Or all are sadden'd with the glooms of care.'Twas thus, if ancient Fame the truth unfold,Two faithful needles from th' informing touch℣. 326. Two faithful needles, &c.] See the elegant poem recited by Cardinal Bembo in the character of Lucretius,  vi.  2. c. v.Of the same parent-stone together drewIts mystick virtue, and at first conspir'dWith fatal impulse quiv'ring to the pole;Then tho' disjoin'd by kingdoms, tho' the mainRowl'd its broad surge betwixt, and diff'rent starsBeheld their wakeful motions, yet preserv'dThe former friendship, and remember'd stillTh' alliance of their birth: whate'er the lineWhich one possess'd nor pause nor quiet knewThe sure associate ere with trembling speedHe four d its path, and fix'd unerring there.Such is the secret union when we feelA song, a flow'r, a name, at once restoreThose long-connected scenes where first they mov'd

By these mysterious ties, &c.] The act of remembering seems almost wholly to depend on the association of ideas.Of Mem'ry her ideal train preservesEntire, or when they would elude her watchReclaims their fleeting footsteps from the wasteOf dark oblivion; thus collecting allThe various forms of being to presentBefore the curious aim of mimick ArtTheir largest choice, like spring's unfolded blooms,Exhaling sweetness that the skilful beeMay taste at will from their selected spoilsTo work her dulcet food: for not th' expanseOf living lakes in summer's noontide calmReflects the bord'ring shade and sunbright heav'nsWith fairer semblance, not the sculptur'd goldMore faithful keeps the graver's lively trace,Than he whose birth the sister pow'rs of ArtPropitious view'd, and from his genial starShed influence to the seeds of fancy kind,Than his attemper'd bosom must preserve

Thus at lengthEndow'd with all that Nature can bestowThe child of Fancy oft' in silence bendsO'er these mixt treasures of his pregnant breastWith conscious pride; from them he oft' resolvesTo frame he knows not what excelling things,And win he knows not what sublime rewardOf praise and wonder. By degrees the MindFeels her young nerves dilate, the plastick pow'rsLabour for action, blind emotions heaveHis bosom, and with loveliest frenzy caughtFrom earth to heav'n he rowls his daring eye,From heav'n to earth. Anon ten thousand shapes,Like spectres trooping to the wizard's call,Flit swift before him: from the womb of earth,From ocean's bed, they come: th' eternal heav'nsDisclose their splendours, and the dark abyssPours out her births unknown. With fixed gazeHe marks the rising phantoms, now comparesTheir diff'rent forms, now blends them, now divides,Enlarges and extenuates by turns;Opposes, ranges in fantastick bands,
And infinitely varies: hither now,Now thither, fluctuates his inconstant aim,With endless choice perplex'd. At length his planBegins to open, lucid order dawns,And as from Chaos old the jarring seedsOf Nature at the voice divine repair'dEach to its place, till rosy earth unveil'dHer fragrant bosom, and the joyful sunSprung up the blue serene, by swift degreesThus disentangled his entire designEmerges. Colours mingle, features join,And lines converge; the fainter parts retire,The fairer eminent in light advance,And ev'ry image on its neighbour smiles.A while he stands, and with a father's joyContemplates, then with Promethean artInto its proper vehicle he breathes℣. 411. Into its proper vehicle, &c.] This relates to the different sorts of corporeal mediums by which the ideas of the artists are rendered palpable to the senses, as by sounds in musick, by lines and shadows in painting, by diction in poetry, &c.The fair conception, which imbody'd thusAnd permanent becomes to eyes or earsAn object ascertain'd; while thus inform'dThe various organs of his mimick skill,The consonance of sounds, the featur'd rock,The shadowy picture and impassion'd verse,Beyond their proper pow'rs attract the soulBy that expressive semblance, while in sight
Of Nature's great original we scanThe lively child of Art, while line by lineAnd feature after feature we referTo that sublime exemplar whence it stoleThose animating charms. Thus beauty's palmBetwixt them wav'ring hangs, applauding loveDoubts where to chuse, and mortal man aspiresTo tempt creative praise. As when a cloudOf gath'ring hail with limpid crusts of iceEnclos'd, and obvious to the beaming sun,Collects his large effulgence, straight the heav'nsWith equal flames present on either handThe radiant visage, Persia stands at gazeAppall'd, and on the brink of Ganges doubtsThe snowy vested seer, in Mithra's name,To which the fragrance of the south shall burn,To which his warbled orisons ascend.Such various bliss the welltun'd heart enjoysFavour'd of Heav'n, while plung'd in sordid caresTh' unfeeling vulgar mocks the boon divine,And harsh Austerity, from whose rebukeYoung Love and smiling Wonder shrink away,Abash'd and chill of heart, with sager frownsCondemns the fair enchantment. On my strainPerhaps ev'n now some cold fastidious judgeCasts a disdainful eye, and calls my toil,And calls the love and beauty which I sing,The dream of Folly. Thou, grave Censor! say,
Is beauty then a dream, because the gloomsOf dulness hang too heavy on thy senseTo let her shine upon thee? So the manWhose eye ne'er open'd on the light of heav'nMight smile with scorn while raptur'd Vision tellsOf the gay colour'd radiance flushing brightO'er all creation. From the wise be farSuch gross unhallow'd pride! Nor needs my songDescend so low, but rather now unfold,If human thought could reach or words unfold,By what mysterious fabrick of the mindThe deep-felt joys and harmony of soundResult from airy motion, and from shapeThe lovely phantoms of sublime and fair.By what fine ties hath God connected things,When present in the mind, which in themselvesHave no connexion? Sure the rising sunO'er the cerulean convex of the seaWith equal brightness and with equal warmthMight rowl his fiery orb, nor yet the soulThus feel her frame expanded, and her pow'rsExulting in the splendour she beholds,Like a young conq'ror moving thro' the pompOf some triumphal day. When join'd at eveSoft-murm'ring streams and gales of gentlest breathMelodious Philomela's wakeful strainAttempter, could not man's discerning earThro' all its tones the sympathy pursue,
Nor yet this breath divine of nameless joySteal thro' his veins and fan th' awaken'd heart,Mild as the breeze yet rapt'rous as the song?But were not Nature still endow'd at largeWith all which life requires tho' unadorn'dWith such enchantment? Wherefore then her formSo exquisitely fair? her breath persum'dWith such ethereal sweetness? whence her voiceInform'd at will to raise or to depressTh' impassion'd soul? and whence the robes of lightWhich thus invest her with more lovely pompThan Fancy can describe? Whence but from thee,O Source Divine of everflowing love!And thy unmeasur'd goodness? Not contentWith ev'ry sood of life to nourish man,By kind illusions of the wond'ring senseThou mak'st all Nature beauty to his eyeOr musick to his ear: wellpleas'd he scansThe goodly prospect, and with inward smilesTreads the gay verdure of the painted plain,Beholds the azure canopy of heav'n,And living lamps that over-arch his headWith more than regal splendour; bends his earsTo the full choir of water, air, and earth;Nor heeds the pleasing errour of his thought,Nor doubts the painted green or azure arch,Nor questions more the musick's mingling soundsThan space or motion, or eternal time;
So sweet he feels their influence to attractThe sixed soul, to brighten the dull gloomsOf care, and make the destin'd road of lifeDelightful to his feet. So fables tellTh' advent'rous hero bound on hard exploitsBeholds with glad surprise, by secret spellsOf some kind sage the patron of his toils,A visionary paradise disclos'dAmid the dubious wild; with streams, and shades,And airy songs, th' enchanted landscape smiles,Cheers his long labours, and renews his frame.What then is taste, but these internal pow'rsActive, and strong, and feelingly aliveTo each fine impulse? a discerning senseOf decent and sublime, with quick disgustFrom things deform'd, or disarrang'd, or grossIn species? This nor gems, nor stores of gold,Nor purple state, nor culture, can bestow,But God alone, when first his active handImprints the secret bias of the soul.He, mighty Parent! wise and just in all,Free as the vital breeze or light of heav'n,Reveals the charms of Nature. Ask the swainWho journeys homeward from a summer day'sLong labour, why forgetful of his toilsAnd due repose he loiters to beholdThe sunshine gleaming as thro' amber cloudsO'er all the western sky? full soon, I ween,
His rude expression and untutor'd airsBeyond the pow'r of language will unfoldThe form of Beauty smiling at his heart,How lovely, how commanding! But tho' Heav'nIn ev'ry breast hath sown these early seedsOf love and admiration, yet in vainWithout fair culture's kind parental aid,Without enliv'ning suns and genial show'rs,And shelter from the blast, in vain we hopeThe tender plant should rear its blooming head,Or yield the harvest promis'd in its spring.Nor yet will ev'ry soil with equal storesRepay the tiller's labour, or attendHis will obsequious, whether to produceThe olive or the laurel. Diff'rent mindsIncline to diff'rent objects; one pursuesThe vast alone, the wonderful, the wild;℣. 547. —one pursues—The vast alone, &c] See the note to ℣. 18. of this book.Another sighs for harmony, and grace,And gentlest beauty. Hence when lightning firesThe arch of heav'n, and thunders rock the ground,When furious whirlwinds rend the howling air,And ocean groaning from his lowest bedHeaves his tempest'ous billows to the sky,Amid the mighty uproar while belowThe nations tremble, Shakespeare looks abroadFrom some high cliff superiour, and enjoys
The elemental war; but Waller longs℣. 558. Waller longs, &c.]
"O! how I long my careless limbs to lay"Under the plantain shade, and all the day"With am'rous airs my fancy entertain," &c.Waller. Battle of the Summer Islands, Canto I.
And again,
"While in the Park I sing the list'ning deer,"Attend my passion and forget to fear," &c.At Penshurst.All on the margin of some flow'ry streamTo spread his careless limbs amid the coolOf plantane shades, and to the list'ning deerThe tale of slighted vows and love's disdainResound soft-warbling all the livelong day:Consenting Zephyr sighs, the weeping rillJoins in his plaint melodious, mute the groves,And hill and dale with all their echoes mourn.Such and so various are the tastes of men!Oh blest of Heav'n! whom not the languid songsOf Luxury the Siren, not the bribesOf sordid Wealth, nor all the gaudy spoilsOf pageant Honour, can seduce to leaveThose ever-blooming sweets which from the storeOf Nature fair Imagination cullsTo charm th' enliven'd soul! What tho' not allOf mortal offspring can attain the heightsOf envy'd life, tho' only few possessPatrician treasures or imperial state?
Yet Nature's care, to all her children just,With richer treasures and an ampler stateEndows at large whatever happy manWill deign to use them. His the city's pomp,The rural honours his: whate'er adornsThe princely dome, the column and the arch,The breathing marbles and the sculptur'd gold,Beyond the proud possessor's narrow claim,His tuneful breast enjoys. For him the springDistils her dews, and from the silken gemIts lucid leaves unfolds; for him the handOf Autumn tinges ev'ry fertile branchWith blooming gold and blushes like the Morn.Each passing Hour sheds tribute from her wings,And still new beauties meet his lonely walk,And loves unfelt attract him. Not a breeze℣. 593. —Not a breeze, &c.] That this account may not appear rather poetically extravagant than just in philosophy, it may be proper to produce the sentiment of one of the greatest, wisest, and best of men on this head; one so little to be suspected to partiality in the case, that he reckons it among those avours for which he was especially thankful to the gods, that they had not suffered him to make any great proficiency in the arts of eloquence and poetry, lest by that means he should have been diverted from pursuits of more importance to his high station. Speaking of the beauty of universal Nature, he observes that "there is a pleasing and graceful aspect in every object we perceive" when once we consider its connexion with that general order. He instances in many things which at first sight would be thought rather deformities, and then adds, "that a man who enjoys a sensibility of temper, with a just comprehension of the universal order—will dscern many amiable things, not credible to every mind, but to those alone who have entered into an honourable familiarity with Nature and her works." M. Ant. iii. 2.

Would the formsOf servile custom cramp her gen'rous pow'rs?Would sordid policies, the barb'rous growthOf Ignorance and Rapine, bow her down

Thus the menWhom Nature's works can charm with God himselfHold converse, grow familiar day by dayWith his conceptions, act upon his plan,And form to his the relish of their souls.END OF BOOK THIRD.THE PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION.The General Argument.THE Pleasures of the Imagination proceed either from natural objects, as from a flourishing grove, a clear and murmuring fountain, a calm sea by moonlight, or from works of art, such as a noble edifice, a musical tune, a , a picture, a poem. In treating of thse Pleasures we must begin with the former class, they being original to the other; and nothing more being necessary in order to explain them than a view of our natural inclination toward greatness and beauty, and of those appearances in the world around us to which that inclination is adapted. This is the subject of the first book of the following poem.But the Pleasures which we receive from the elegant arts, from musick, sculpture, painting, and poetry, are much more various and complicated. In them (besides greatness and beauty, or forms proper to the Imagination) we find interwoven frequent representations of truth, of virtue and vice, of circumstances proper to move us with laughter, or to encite in us pity, fear, and the other passions. Thse moral and intellectual objects are described in the second book, to which the third properly belongs as an episode, though too large to have been included in it.With the abovementioned causes of Pleasure, which are universal in the course of human life, and appertain to

our higher faculties, many others do generally concur, more limited in their operation, or of an inferiour origin; such are the novelty of objects, the association of ideas, affections of the bodily senses, influences of education, national habits, and the like. To illustrate these, and from the whole to determine the character of a perfect taste, is the argument of the fourth book.Hitherto the Pleasures of the Imagination belong to the human species in general; but there are certain particular men whose Imagination is endowed with powers and susceptible of Pleasures which the generality of mankind never participate: these are the men of genius, destined by Nature to excel in one or other of the arts already mentioned. It is proposed therefore in the last place, to delineate that genius which in some degree appears common to them all, yet with a more peculiar consideration of poetry, inasmuch as poetry is the most extensive of those arts, the most philosophical, and the most useful.THE PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION.BOOK I.MDCCLVII.The Argument.THE subject proposed. Dedication. The ideas of the Supreme Being the exemplar of all things. The variety of constitution in the minds of men, with its final cause. The general character of a fine Imagination. All the immediate Pleasures of the human Imagination proceed either from greatness or beauty in external objects. The Pleasure from greatness, with its final cause. The natural connexion of beauty with truthTruth is here taken not in a logical but in a mixed and popular sense, or for what has been called the truth of things, denoting as well their natural and regular condition as a proper estimate or judgment concerning them. and good. The different orders of beauty in different objects. The infinite and allcomprehending form of beauty, which belongs to the Divine Mind. The partial and artificial forms of beauty which belong to inferiour intellectual beings. The origin and general conduct of beauty in man. The subordination of local beauties to the beauty of the universe. Conclusion.WITH what enchantment Nature's goodly sceneAttracts the sense of mortals; how the mindor its own eye doth objects nobler stillPrepare; how men by various lessons learnTo judge of Beauty's praise; what raptures fillThe breast with Fancy's native arts endow'd,And what true culture guides it to renown,My Verse unfolds.

Goddess of the Lyre,Whose awful tones control the moving sphere,Wilt thou, eternal Harmony! descend

What tho' firstIn years unseason'd, haply ere the sportsOf childhood yet were o'er, the advent rous layWith many splendid prospects, many charms,Allur'd my heart, nor conscious whence they sprung,Nor heedful of their end? yet serious TruthHer empire o'er the calm sequester'd themeAsserted soon, while Falsehood's evil brood,Vice and deceitful Pleasure, she at onceExcluded, and my fancy's careless toilDrew to the better cause. Maturer aidThy friendship added, in the paths of life,The busy paths, my unaccustom'd feetPreserving; nor to truth's recess divineThro' this wide argument's unbeaten spaceWithholding surer guidance, while by turnsWe trac'd the sages old, or while the queen

Mean-while, O my faithful Friend!O early chosen, ever found the same,And trusted and belov'd! once more the verseLong destin'd, always obvious to thine ear,Attend indulgent: so in latest years,When Time thy head with honours shall have cloth'dSacred to even Virtue, may thy mind
Amid the calm review of seasons past,Fair offices of friendship, or kind peaceOr publick zeal, may then thy mind wellpleas'dRecall these happy studies of our prime!From Heav'n my strains begin, from Heav'n descendsThe flame of genius to the chosen breast,And beauty, with poetick wonder join'dAnd inspiration. Ere the rising sunShone o'er the deep, or 'mid the vault of nightThe moon her silver lamp suspended, ereThe vales with springs were water'd, or with grovesOf oak or pine the ancient hills were crown'd,Then the Great Spirit, whom his works adore,Within his own deep essence view'd the forms,The forms eternal, of created things,The radiant sun, the moon's nocturnal lamp,The mountains and the streams, the ample storesOf earth, of heav'n, of Nature. From the firstOn that full scene his love divine he fix'd,His admiration, till in time completeWhat he admir'd and lov'd his vital pow'rUnfolded into being. Hence the breathOf life informing each organick frame,Hence the green earth, and wild resounding waves,Hence light and shade alternate, warmth and cold,And bright autumnal skies and vernal show'rs,And all the fair variety of things.But not alike to ev'ry mortal eye
Is this great scene unveil'd; for while the claimsOf social life to diff'rent labours urgeThe active pow'rs of man, with wisest careHath Nature on the multitude of mindsImpress'd a various bias, and to eachDecreed its province in the common toil.To some she taught the fabrick of the sphere,The changeful moon, the circuit of the stars,The golden zones of heav'n: to some she gaveTo search the story of eternal thought,Of space and time, of Fate's unbroken chain,And will's quick movement: others by the handShe led o'er vales and mountains, to exploreWhat healing virtue dwells in ev'ry veinOf herbs or trees. But some to nobler hopesWere destin'd; some within a finer mouldShe wrought, and temper'd with a purer flame:To these the Sire Omnipotent unfoldsIn fuller aspects and with fairer lightsThis picture of the world. Thro' ev'ry partThey trace the lofty sketches of his hand;In earth or air, the meadow's flow'ry store,The moon's mild radiance, or the virgin's mien,Dress'd in attractive smiles, they see portray'd(As far as mortal eyes the portrait scan)Those lineaments of beauty which delightThe mind supreme: they also feel their forceEnamour'd; they partake th' eternal joy.For as old Memnon's image, long renown'dThro' fabling Egypt, at the genial touchOf morning from its inmost frame sent forthSpontaneous musick, so doth Nature's handTo certain attributes which matter claimsAdapt the finer organs of the mind;So the glad impulse of those kindred pow'rs(Of form, of colour's cheerful pomp, of soundMelodious, or of motion aptly sped)Detains th' enliven'd sense, till soon the soulFeels the deep concord, and assents thro' allHer functions. Then the charm by Fate prepar'dDiffuseth its enchantment; Fancy dreams,Rapt into high discourse with prophets old,And wand'ring thro' Elysium, Fancy dreamsOf sacred fountains, of o'ershadowing groves,Whose walks with godlike harmony resound,Fountains which Homer visits, happy grovesWhere Milton dwells. The intellectual pow'rOn the mind's throne suspends his graver cares,And smiles: the passions to divine reposePersuaded yield, and love and joy aloneAre waking; love and joy, such as awaitAn angel's meditation. O! attend,Whoe'er thou art whom these delights can touch,Whom Nature's aspect, Nature's simple garb,Can thus command: O! listen to my Song,And I will guide thee to her blissful walks,
And teach thy solitude her voice to hear,And point her gracious features to thy view.Know then whate'er of the world's ancient store,Whate'er of mimick art's reflected scenes,With love and admiration thus inspireAttentive Fancy, her delighted sonsIn two illustrious orders comprehendSelftaught. From him whose rustick toil the larkCheers warbling, to the bard whose daring thoughtsRange the full orb of being, still the formWhich Fancy worships or sublime or fairHer votaries proclaim. I see them dawn!I see the radiant visions where they rise,More lovely than when Lucifer displaysHis glitt'ring forehead thro' the gates of mornTo lead the train of Phoebus and the spring!Say, why was man so eminently rais'dAmid the vast creation? why empower'dThro' life and death to dart his watchful eye,With thoughts beyond the limit of his frame,But that th' Omnipotent might send him forth,In sight of angels and immortal minds,As on an ample theatre, to joinIn contest with his equals, who shall bestThe task achieve, the course of noble toils,By wisdom and by mercy preordain'd?Might send him forth the sovran good to learn,To chase each meaner purpose from his breast,
And thro' the mists of passion and of sense,And thro' the pelting storms of chance and pain,To hold straight on, with constant heart and eyeStill fix'd upon his everlasting palm,Th' approving smile of Heav'n? Else wherefore burnsIn mortal bosoms this unquenched hopeThat seeks from day to day sublimer ends,Happy tho' restless? why departs the soulWide from the track and journey of her timesTo grasp the good she knows not? in the fieldOf things which may be, in the spacious fieldOf science, potent arts, or dreadful arms,To raise up scenes in which her own desiresContented may repose, when things which arePull on her temper like a twice told tale;Her temper, still demanding to be free,Spurning the rude control of wilful Might,Proud of her dangers brav'd, her griefs endur'd,Her strength severely prov'd? To these high aimsWhich reason and affection prompt in manNot adverse nor unapt hath Nature fram'dHis bold Imagination; for amidThe various forms which this full world presentsLike rivala to his choice, what human breastE'er doubts before the transient and minuteTo prize the vast, the stable, the sublime?Who that from heights aerial sends his eyeAround a wild horizon, and surveys
Indus or Ganges rolling his broad waveThro' mountains, plains, thro' spacious cities old,And regions dark with woods, will turn awayTo mark the path of some penurious rillWhich murm'reth at his feet? Where does the SoulConsent her soaring fancy to restrain,Which bears her up as on an eagle's wingsDestin'd for highest heav'n? or which of Fate'sTremend'ous barriers shall confine her flightTo any humbler quarry? The rich earthCannot detain her, nor the ambient airWith all its changes. For a while with joyShe hovers o'er the sun, and views the smallAttendant orbs beneath his sacred beamEmerging from the deep, like cluster'd isles,Whose rocky shores to the glad sailor's eyeReflect the gleams of morning; for a whileWith pride she sees his firm paternal swayBend the reluctant planets to move eachRound its perpetual year; but soon she quitsThat prospect; meditating lostier viewsShe darts advent'rous up the long careerOf comets, thro' the constellations holdsHer course, and now looks back on all the stars,Whose blended flames as with a milky streamPart the blue region. Empyrean tracks,Where happy souls beyond this concave heav'nAbide, she then explores, whence purer light
For countless ages travels thro' th' abyss,Nor hath in sight of mortals yet arriv'd:Upon the wide creation's utmost shoreAt length she stands, and the dread space beyondContemplates, half recoiling; nathless downThe gloomy void astonish'd yet unquell'dShe plungeth, down th' unfathomable gulfWhere God alone hath being; there her hopesRest at the fated goal: for from the birthOf humankind the Sovran Maker saidThat not in humble nor in brief delight,Not in the fleeting echoes of Renown,Pow'rs purple robes, nor Pleasure's flow'ry lap,The soul should find contentment, but from theseTurning disdainful to an equal good,Thro' Nature's op'ning walks enlarge her aimTill ev'ry bound at length should disappearAnd infinite perfection fill the scene.But lo! where Beauty dress'd in gentler pompWith comely steps advancing claims the verseHer charms inspire. O Beauty! source of praise,Of honour, ev'n to mute and lifeless things;O thou that kindlest in each human heartLove and the wish of poets, when their tongueWould teach to other bosoms what so charmsTheir own! O child of Nature and the SoulIn happiest hour brought forth, the doubtful garbOf words, of earthly language, all too mean,
Too lowly, I account in which to clotheThy form divine! for thee the mind aloneBeholds, nor half thy brightness can revealThro' those dim organs whose corporeal touchO'ershadoweth thy pure essence. Yet my Muse!If Fortune call thee to the task, wait thouThy favourable seasons; then while fearAnd doubt are absent thro' wide Nature's boundsExpatiate with glad step, and chuse at willWhate'er bright spoils the florid earth contains,Whate'er the waters or the liquid air,To manifest unblemish'd Beauty's praise,And o'er the breasts of mortals to extendHer gracious empire. Wilt thou to the islesAtlantick, to the rich Hesperian clime,Fly in the train of Autumn, and look onAnd learn from him, while as he roves aroundWhere'er his fingers touch the fruitful groveThe branches bloom with gold, where'er his footImprints the soil the ripening clusters swell,Turning aside their foliage, and come forthIn purple lights, till ev'ry hillock glowsAs with the blushes of an ev'ning sky?Or wilt thou that Thessalian landscape traceWhere slow Peneus his clear glassy tideDraws smooth along, between the winding cliffsOf Ossa and the pathless woods unshornThat wave o'er huge Olympus? Down the stream
Look how the mountains with their double rangeEmbrace the vale of Tempe, from each sideAscending steep to heav'n a rocky moundCover'd with ivy and the laurel boughsThat crown'd young Phoebus for the Python slain.Fair Tempe! on whose primrose banks the mornAwoke most fragrant, and the noon repos'dIn pomp of lights and shadows most sublime;Whose lawns, whose glades, ere human footsteps yetHad trac'd an entrance, were the hallow'd hauntOf sylvan pow'rs immortal, where they satOft' in the Golden Age, the Nymphs and Fauns,Beneath some arbour branching o'er the flood,And leaning round hung on th' instructive lipsOf hoary Pan, or o'er some open daleDanc'd in light measures to his sev'nfold pipe,While Zephyr's wanton hand along their pathFlung show'rs of painted blossoms, fertile dews,And one perpetual spring. But if our taskMore lofty rites demand, with all good vowsThen let us hasten to the rural hauntWhere young Melissa dwells; nor thou refuseThe voice which calls thee from thy lov'd retreat,But hither, gentle Maid! thy sootsteps turn;Here to thy own unquestionable themeO fair! O graceful! bend thy polish'd brow,Assenting, and the gladness of thy eyesImpart to me, like morning's wished light
Seen thro' the vernal air. By yonder stream,Where beech and elm along the bord'ring meadSend forth wild melody from ev'ry boughTogether let us wander, where the hillsCover'd with fleeces to the lowing valeReply, where tidings of content and peaceEach echo brings. Lo how the western funO'er fields and floods, o'er ev'ry living soul,Diffuseth glad repose! There while I speakOf Beauty's honours thou, Melissa! thouShalt hearken, not unconscious, while I tellHow first from heav'n she came, how after allThe works of life, the elemental scenes,The hours, the seasons, she had oft' explor'd,At length her fav'rite mansion and her throneShe fix'd in woman's form; what pleasing tiesTo virtue bind her, what effectual aidThey lend each other's pow'r, and how divineTheir union, should some unambitious maidTo all th' enchantment of th' Idalian queenAdd sanctity and wisdom. While my tongueProlongs the tale, Melissa! thou may'st feignTo wonder whence my rapture is inspir'd;But soon the smile which dawns upon thy lipShall tell it, and the tend'rer bloom o'er allThat soft cheek springing to the marble neck,Which bends aside in vain, revealing moreWhat it would thus keep silent, and in vain
The sense of praise dissembling. Then my songGreat Nature's winning arts, which thus informWith joy and love the ragged bread of man,Should sound in numbers worthy of such a theme;While all whose souls have ever felt the forceOf those enchanting pons to my lyreShould throng attentive, and receive once moreTheir influence, unobscur'd by any cloudOf vulgar care, and purer than the handOf Fortune can bestow: nor to confirmTheir sway should awful Contemplation scornTo join his dictate to the genuine strainOf Pleasure's tongue, nor yet ould Pleasure's earBe much averse. Ye chiefly, gentle bandOf Youths and Virgins! who thro' many a wishAnd many a fond pursuit, as in some sceneOf magick bright and fleeting are allur'dBy various beauty, if the pleasing toilCan yield a moment's respite, hither turnYour favourable ear, and trust my words.I do not mean on bless'd Religion's seatPresenting Superstition's gloomy formTo dash your soothing hopes; I do not meanTo bid the jealous Thund'rer fire the heav'ns,Or shapes infernal rend the groaning earth,And scare you from your joys. My cheerful songWith happier omens calls you to the field,Pleas'd with your gen'rous ardour in the chase,
And warm like you. Then tell me, (for ye know)Doth Beauty ever deign to dwell where useAnd aptitude are strangers? is her praiseConfes'd in aught whose most peculiar endsAre lame and fruitless? or did Nature meanThis pleasing call the herald of a lie,To hide the shame of discord and disease,And win each fond admirer into sares,Foil'd, bassled? No: with better providenceThe gen'ral Mother, conscious how infirmHer offspring tread the paths of good and ill,Thus to the choice of credulous desireDoth objects the completest of their tribeDistinguish and commend. Yon' flow'ry bankCloth'd in the soft magnificence of springWill not the flocks approve it? will they askThe reedy fen for pasture? That clear rillWhich trickleth murm'ring from the mossy rock,Yields it less wholesome bev'rage to the wornAnd thirsty trav'ller than the standing poolWith muddy weeds o'ergrown? Yon' ragged vine,Whose lean and sullen clusters mourn the rageOf Eurus, will the winepress or the bowlReport of her as of the swelling grapeWhich glitters thro' the tendrils like a gemWhen first it meets the sun? Or what are allThe various charms to life and sense adjoin'd?Are they not pledges of a state entire,
Where native order reigns, with ev'ry partIn health and ev'ry function well perform'd?Thus then at first was Beauty sent from heav'n,The lovely ministress of Truth and GoodIn this dark world; for Truth and Good are one,And Beauty dwells in them and they in herWith like participation. Wherefore then,O Sons of Earth! would ye dissolve the tie?O! wherefore with a rash and greedy aimSeek ye to rove thro' ev'ry flatt'ring sceneWhich Beauty seems to deck, nor once inquireWhere is the suffrage of eternal Truth,Or where the seal of undeceitful good,To save your search from folly? Wanting theseLo! Beauty withers in your void embrace,And with the glitt'ring of an idiot's toyDid fancy mock your vows. Nor yet let hope,That kindliest inmate of the youthful breast,Be hence appall'd, be turn'd to coward sloth,Sitting in silence with dejected eyes,Incurious, and with folded hands: far lessLet scorn of wild fantastick folly's dreams,Or hatred of the bigot's savage pride,Persuade you e'er that Beauty, or the loveWhich waits on Beauty, may not brook to hearThe sacred lore of undeceitful goodAnd truth eternal. From the vulgar crowdTho' Superstition, tyranness abhorr'd!
The rev'rence due to this majestick pairWith threats and execration still demands;Tho' the tame wretch who asks of her the wayTo their celestial dwelling she constrainsTo quench or set at nought the lamp of GodWithin his frame; thro' many a cheerless wildTho' forth she leads him credulous and dark,And aw'd with dubious notion; tho' at lengthHaply she plunge him into cloister'd cellsAnd mansions unrelenting as the grave,But void of quiet, there to watch the hoursOf midnight, there amid the screaming owl'sDire song with spectres or with guilty shadesTo talk of pangs and everlasting wo;Yet be not ye dismay'd; a gentler starPresides o'er your adventure. From the bow'rWhere Wisdom sat with her Athenian sonsCould but my happy hand intwine a wreathOf Plato's olive with the Mantuan bay,Then (for what need of cruel fear to you,To you whom godlike love can well command?)Then should my pow'rful voice at once dispelThose monkish horrours; should in words divineRelate how favour'd minds like you inspir'd,And taught their inspiration to conductBy ruling Heav'n's decree, thro' various walks,And prospects various, but delightful all,Move onward; while now myrtle groves appear
Now arms and radiant trophies, now the rodsOf empire with the curule throne, or nowThe domes of Contemplation and the Muse.Led by that hope sublime whose cloudless eyeThro' the fair toils and ornaments of earthDiscerns the nobler life reserv'd for heav'n,eat'd alike they worship round the shrineWhere Truth conspic'ous with her sister-twins,The undivided partners of her sway,With Good and Beauty reigns. O! let not usBy Pleasure's lying blandishments detain'd,Or crouching to the frowns of bigot Rage,O! let not us one moment pause to joinThat chosen band: and if the gracious Pow'rWho first awaken'd my untutor'd songWill to my invocation grant anewThe tuneful spirit, then thro' all our pathsNe'er shall the sound of this devoted lyreBe wanting, whether on the rosy meadWhen summer smiles to warn the melting heartOf Luxury's allurement, whether firmAgainst the torrent and the stubborn hillTo urge free Virtue's steps, and to her sideSummon that strong divinity of soulWhich conquers Chance and Fate, or on the height,The goal assign'd her, haply to proclaimHer triumph, on her brow to place the crownOf uncorrupted praise, thro' future worlds
To follow her interminated way,And bless Heav'n's image in the heart of man.Such is the worth of Beauty, such her pow'r,So blameless, so rever'd. It now remainsIn just gradation thro' the various ranksOf being to contemplate how her giftsRise in due measure, watchful to attendThe steps of rising Nature. Last and leastIn colours mingling with a random blazeDoth Beauty dwell: then higher in the formsOf simplest easiest measure, in the boundsOf circle, cube, or sphere: the third ascentTo symmetry adds colour: thus the pearlShines in the concave of its purple bed,And painted shells along some winding shoreCatch with indented folds the glancing sun.Next as we rise appear the blooming tribesWhich clothe the fragrant earth, which draw from herTheir own nutrition, which are born and die,Yet in their seed immortal: such the flow'rsWith which young Maia pays the village maidsThat hail her natal morn, and such the grovesWhich blithe Pomona rears on Vaga's bankTo seed the bowl of Ariconian swainsWho quaff beneath her branches. Nobler stillIs Beauty's name where to the full consentOf members and of features, to the prideOf colour and the vital change of growth,
Life's holy flame with piercing sense is giv'n,While active motion speaks the temper'd soul:So moves the bird of Juno, so the steedWith rival swiftness heats the dusty plain,And faithful dogs with eager airs of joySalute their fellows. What sublimer pompAdorns the seat where Virtue dwells on earthAnd Truth's eternal daylight shines around;What palm belongs to man's imperial front,And woman, pow'rful with becoming smiles,Chief of terrestrial natures! need we nowStrive to inculcate? Thus hath Beauty thereHer most conspic'ous praise to Matter lentWhere most conspic'ous thro' that shadowy Breaks forth the bright expression of a mindBy steps directing our enraptur'd searchTo him the first of minds, the chief, the sole,From whom thro' this wide complicated worldDid all her various lineaments begin;To whom alone, consenting and entire,At once their mutual influence all display.He, God most high, (bear witness Earth and Heav'n!)The living fountains in himself containsOf beauteous and sublime. With him inthron'dEre days or years trod their ethereal way,In his supreme intelligence inthron'd,The queen of Love holds her unclouded state,Urania. Thee, O Father! this extent
Of matter, thee the sluggish earth and trackOf seas, the heav'ns and heav'nly splendours, feelPervading, quick'ning, moving. From the depthOf thy great essence forth didst thou conductEternal Form, and there where Chaos reign'dGav'st her dominion to erect her seatAnd sanctify the mansion. All her worksWellpleas'd thou didst behold; the gloomy firesOf storm or earthquake, and the purest lightOf summer; soft Campania's newborn rose,And the slow weed which pines on Russian hills,Comely alike to thy full vision stand;To thy surrounding vision, which unitesAll essences and pow'rs of the great worldIn one sole order, fair alike they stand,As features well consenting, and alikeRequir'd by Nature ere she could attainHer just resemblance to the perfect shapeOf universal Beauty, which with theeDwelt from the first. Thou also, Ancient Mind!Whom love and free beneficence awaitIn all thy doings, to inferiour mindsThy offspring, and to man thy youngest son,Refusing no convenient gift nor good,Their eyes didst open in this earth, yon' heav'n,Those starry worlds, the countenance divineOf Beauty to behold: but not to themDidst thou her awful magnitude reveal
Such as before thine own unbounded sightShe stands, (for never shall created soulConceive that object) nor to all their kindsThe same in shape or features didst thou frameHer image. Measuring well their diff'rent spheresOf sense and action, thy paternal handHath for each race prepar'd a diff'rent testOf Beauty, own'd and reverenc'd as their guideMost apt, most faithful. Thence inform'd they scanThe objects that surround them, and select,Since the great whole disclaims their scanty view,Each for himself selects, peculiar partsOf Nature, what the standard fix'd by Heav'nWithin his breast approves; acquiring thusA partial beauty which becomes his lot,A beauty which his eye may comprehend,His hand may copy; leaving, O Supreme!O thou whom none hath utter'd! leaving allTo thee that infinite consummate formWhich the great pow'rs, the gods around thy throneAnd nearest to thy counsels, know with theeFor ever to have been, but who she isOr what her likeness know not. Man surveysA narrower scene, where by the mix'd effectOf things corporeal on his passive mindHe judgeth what is fair. Corporeal thingsThe mind of man impel with various pow'rs,And various features to his eye disclose.
The pow'rs which move his sense with instant joy,The features which attract his heart to love,He marks, combines, reposits. Other pow'rsAnd features of the selfsame thing (unlessThe beauteous form, the creature of his mind,Request their close alliance) he o'erlooksForgotten, or with self-beguiling zealWhene'er his passions mingle in the workHalf alters, half disowns. The tribes of menThus from their diff'rent functions, and the shapesFamiliar to their eye, with art obtain,Unconscious of their purpose, yet with artObtain the Beauty fitting man to love,Whose proud desires from Nature's homely toilOft' turn away fastidious, asking stillHis mind's high aid to purify the formFrom matter's gross communion, to secureFor ever from the meddling hand of ChangeOr rude Decay her features, and to addWhatever ornaments may suit her mienWhate'er he finds them scatter'd thro' the pathsOf Nature or of Fortune; then he seatsTh' accomplish'd image deep within his breast,Reviews it, and accounts it good and fair.Thus the one Beauty of the world entire,The universal Venus, far beyondThe keenest effort of created eyesAnd their most wide horizon dwells inthron'd
In ancient silence: at her footstool standsAn altar burning with eternal fireUnsully'd, unconsum'd. Here ev'ry hour,Here ev'ry moment, in their turns arriveHer offspring, an innumerable bandOf sisters, comely all, but diff'ring farIn age, in stature, and expressive mien,More than bright Helen from her newborn babe.To this maternal shrine in turns they come,Each with her sacred lamp, that from the sourceOf living flame which here immortal slowsTheir portions of its lustre they may drawFor days, or months, or years, for ages some,As their great parent's discipline requires;Then to their sev'ral mansions they depart,In stars, in planets, thro' the unknown shoresOf yon' ethereal ocean. Who can tellEv'n on the surface of this rowling earthHow many make abode? The fields, the groves,The winding rivers, and the azure main,Are render'd solemn by their frequent feet,Their rites sublime. There each her destin'd homeInforms with that pure radiance from the skiesBrought down, and shines thro'out her little sphereExulting. Straight as travellers by nightTurn toward a distant flame, so some fit eyeAmong the various tenants of the sceneDiscerns the heav'n-born phantom seated there,
And owns her charms: hence the wide universeThro' all the seasons of revolving worldsBears witness with its people, gods and men,To Beauty's blissful pow'r, and with the voiceOf grateful admiration still resounds;That voice to which is Beauty's frame divineAs is the cunning of the master's handTo the sweet accent of the welltun'd lyre.Genius of ancient Greece! whose faithful stepsHave led us to these awful solitudesOf Nature and of Science; Nurse rever'dOf gen'rous counsels and heroick deeds!O let some portion of thy matchless praiseDwell in my breast, and teach me to adornThis unattempted theme! Nor be my thoughtsPresumpt'ous counted if amid the calmWhich Hesper sheds along the vernal heav'nIf I from vulgar Superstition's walkImpatient steal, and from th' unseemly ritesOf splendid Adulation, to attendWith hymns thy presence in the sylvan shade,By their malignant footsteps unprofan'd.Come, O renowned Pow'r! thy glowing mienSuch, and so elevated all thy form,As when the great barbarick lord, againAnd yet again diminish'd, hid his faceAmong the herd of satraps and of kings,And at the lightning of thy lifted spear
Crouch'd like a slave. Bring all thy martial spoils,Thy palms, thy laurels, thy triumphal songs,Thy smiling band of arts, thy godlike siresOf civil wisdom, thy unconquer'd youth,After some glorious day rejoicing roundTheir new-erected trophy. Guide my feetThro' fair Lyceum's walk, the olive shadesOf academus, and the sacred valeHaunted by steps divine, where once beneathThat ever-living platane's ample boughsIlissus, by Socratick sounds detain'd,On his neglected urn attentive lay,While Boreas ling'ring on the neighb'ring steepWith beauteous Orithyia his lovetaleIn silent awe suspended: there let meWith blameless hand from thy unenvious fieldsTransplant some living blossoms to adornMy native clime, while far beyond the meedOf Fancy's toil aspiring I unlockThe springs of ancient wisdom, while I add(What cannot be disjoin'd from Beauty's praise)Thy name and native dress, thy works belov'dAnd honour'd, while to my compatriot youthI point the great example of thy sons,And tune to Attick themes the British lyre.END OF BOOK FIRST.THE PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION.BOOK II.The Argument.INTRODUCTION to this more difficult part of the subject. Of truth and its three classes, matter of fact, experimental or scientifical truth, (cont distinguished from opinion) and universal truth; which last is either metaphysical or geometrical, either purely intellectual or perfectly aacted. On the power of discerning truth depends that of acting with the view of an end, a circumstance essential to virtue. Of virtue, considered in the Divine Mind as a perpetual and universal beneficence. Of human virtue, considered as a sysem of particular sentiments and actions, suitable to the design of Providence and the condition of man, to whom it constitutes the chief good and the first beauty. Of vice and its origin. Of ridicule; its general nature and final cause Of the passions, particularly of those which relate to evil natural or moral, and which are generally accounted painful, though not always unattended with Pleasure.THUS far of Beauty and the pleasing formsWhich man's untutor'd fancy from the scenesImperfect of this ever-changing worldCreates and views enamour'd. Now my songSeverer themes demand, mysterious truth,And virtue, sovran good; the spells, the trains,The progeny, of Errour; the dread swayOf Passion, and whatever hidden storesFrom her own lofty deeds and from herselfThe mind acquires. Severer argument,Not less attractive nor deserving lessA constant ear: for what are all the formsEduc'd by fancy from corporeal things,Greatness, or pomp, or symmetry of parts?
Not tending to the heart soon seeble grows,As the blunt arrow 'gainst the knotty trunk,Their impulse on the sense, while the pall'd eyeExpects in vain its tribute, asks in vainWhere are the ornaments it once admir'd?Not so the moral species, nor the pow'rsOf passion and of thought Th' ambitious mindWith objects boundless as her own desiresCan there converse: by these unfading formsTouch'd and awaken'd still, with eager actShe bends each nerve, and meditates wellpleas'dHer gifts, her godlike fortune. Such the seenesNow op'ning round us: may the destin'd VerseMaintain its equal tenour, tho' in tracksObscure and ard'ous! may the Source of Light,Allpresent, allsufficient, guide our stepsThro' ev'ry maze! and whom in childish yearsFrom the loud throng, the beaten paths of wealthAnd pow'r, thou didst apart send forth to speakIn tuneful words concerning highest things,Him still do thou, O Father! at those hoursOf pensive freedom, when the human soulShuts out the rumour of the world, him stillTouch thou with secret lessons; call thou backEach erring thought, and let the yielding strainsFrom his full bosom like a welcome rillSpontaneous from its healthy fountain flow!But from what name, what favourable sign,What heav'nly auspice, rather shall I date
My perilous excursion than from truth,That nearest inmate of the human soul,Estrang'd from whom the countenance divineOf man dissigur'd and dishonour'd, sinksAmong inferiour things? for to the brutesPerception and the transient boons of senseHath Fate imparted, but to man aloneOf sublunary beings was it giv'nEach fleeting impulse on the sensual pow'rsAt leisure to review, with equal eyeTo sean the passion of the stricken nerve,Or the vague object striking, to conductFrom sense, the portal turbulent and loud,Into the mind's wide palace one by oneThe frequent, pressing, fluctuating, forms,And question and compare them. Thus he learnsTheir birth and fortunes, how ally'd they hauntThe avenues of sense, what laws directTheir union, and what various discords riseOr fix'd or casual; which when his clear thoughtRetains, and when his faithful words express,That living image of th' external scene,As in a polish'd mirror held to view,Is truth; where'er it varies from the shapeAnd hue of its exemplar, in that partDim errour lurks. Moreover, from withoutWhen oft' the same society of formsIn the same order have approach'd his mind,
He deigns no more their steps with curious heedTo trace; no more their features or their garbHe now examines, but of them and theirCondition, as with some diviner's tongue,Affirms what Heav'n in ev'ry distant placeThro' ev'ry future season will decree:This too is truth: where'er his prudent lipsWait till experience diligent and flowHas authoris'd their sentence, this is truth;A second higher kind; the parent thisOf Science, or the losty pow'r herself,Science herself, on whom the wants and caresOf social life depend, the substituteOf God's own wisdom in this toilsome world,The providence of man. Yet ost' in vainTo earn her aid with fix'd and anxious eyeHe looks on Nature's and on Fortune's course,Too much in vain: his duller visual rayThe stillness and the persevering actsOf Nature oft' elude, and Fortune oft'With step fantastick from her wonted walkTurns into mazes dim: his sight is foil'd,And the crude sentence of his falt'ring tongueIs but Opinion's verdict half believ'd,And prone to change. Here thou who feelst thine earCongenial to my lyre's profounder tonePause and be watchful. Hitherto the storesWhich feed thy mind and exercise her pow'rsPartake the relish of their native soil,
Their parent earth: but know a nobler dow'rHer sire at birth decreed her, purer giftsFrom his own treasure, forms which never deign'dIn eyes or ears to dwell within the senseOf earthly organs, but sublime were plac'dIn his essential reason, leading thereThat vast ideal host which all his worksThro' endless ages never will reveal.Thus then endow'd the feeble creature man,The slave of hunger and the prey of Death,Even now, even here, in earth's dim prison bound,The language of intelligence divineAttains, repeating oft' concerning oneAnd many, past and present, parts and whole,Those sovran dictates which in farthest heav'n,Where no orb rowls, Eternity's fix'd earHears from coeval truth, when Chance nor Change,Nature's loud progeny, nor Nature's self,Dares intermeddle or approach her throne.Ere long o'er this corporeal world he learnsT' extend her sway, while calling from the deep,From earth and air, their multitudes untoldOf figures and of motions round his walk,For each wide family some single birthHe sets in view, th' impartial type of allIts brethren, suff'ring it to claim beyondTheir common heritage no private gift,No proper fortune. Then whate'er his eyeIn this discerns his bold unerring tongue
Pronounceth of the kindred without bound,Without condition. Such the rise of formsSequester'd far from sense, and ev'ry spotPeculiar in the realms of space or time;Such is the throne which man for Truth amidThe paths of mutability hath builtSecure, unshaken, still, and whence he viewsIn matter's mould'ring structures the pure formsOf triangle or circle, cube or cone,Impassive all, whose attributes nor ForceNor Fate can alter: there he first conceivesTrue being and an intellectual world,The same this hour and ever: thence he deemsOf his own lot above the painted shapesThat fleeting move o'er this terrestrial scene,Looks up, beyond the adamantine gatesOf death expatiates, as his birthright claimsInheritance in all the works of God,Prepares for endless time his plan of life,And counts the universe itself his home.Whence also but from truth, the light of minds,Is human fortune gladden'd with the raysOf virtue? with the moral colours thrownOn ev'ry walk of this our social scene,Adorning for the eye of gods and menThe passions, actions, habitudes of life,And rend'ring earth like heav'n, a sacred placeWhere Love and Praise may take delight to dwell?Let none with heedless tongue from Truth disjoin
The reign of Virtue. Ere the dayspring flow'dLike sisters link'd in Concord's golden chainThey stood before the great Eternal Mind,Their common parent, and by him were bothSent forth among his creatures hand in hand,Inseparably join'd; nor e'er did TruthFind an apt ear to listen to her loreWhich knew not Virtue's voice; nor save where Truth'sMajestick words are heard and understoodDoth Virtue deign t' inhabit. Go, inquireOf Nature, not among Tartarean rocks,Whither the hungry vulture with its preyReturns, not where the lion's sullen roarAt noon resounds along the lonely banksOf ancient Tigris, but her gentler scenes,The dovecote and the shepherd's fold at mornConsult; or by the meadow's fragrant hedge,In springtime when the woodlands first are green,Attend the linnet singing to his mateCouch'd o'er their tender young. To this fond careThou dost not Virtue's honourable nameAttribute; wherefore, save that not one gleamOf truth did e'er discover to themselvesTheir little hearts, or teach them by th' effectsOf that parental love the love itselfTo judge, and measure its officious deeds?But man, whose eyelids Truth has fill'd with day,Discerns how skilfully to bounteous ends
His wise affections move, with free accordAdopts their guidance, yields himself secureTo Nature's prudent impulse, and convertsInstinct to duty and to sacred law:Hence right and fit on earth, while thus to manTh' Almighty Legislator hath explain'dThe springs of action fix'd within his breast,Hath giv'n him pow'r to slacken or restrainTheir effort, and hath shewn him how they joinTheir partial movements with the master-wheelOf the great world, and serve that sacred endWhich he th' Unerring Reason keeps in view.For (if a mortal tongue may speak of himAnd his dread ways) ev'n as his boundless eyeConnecting ev'ry form and ev'ry changeBeholds the perfect beauty, so his willThro' ev'ry hour producing good to allThe family of creatures is itselfThe perfect virtue. Let the grateful swainRemember this as oft' with joy and praiseHe looks upon the falling dews which clotheHis lawns with verdure, and the tender seedNourish within his surrows; when betweenDead seas and burning skies, where long unmov'dThe bark had languish'd, now a rustling galeLifts o'er the fickle waves the dancing prow,Let the glad pilot bursting out in thanksRemember this, lest blind o'erweening pridePollute their off'rings, lest their selfish heart
Say to the heav'nly Ruler "At our call"Relents thy pow'r; by us thy arm is mov'd."Fools! who of God as of each other deem,Who his invariable acts deduceFrom sudden counsels transient as their own,No farther of his bounty than th' event,Which haply meets their loud and eager pray'r,Acknowledge, nor beyond the drop minute,Which haply they have tasted, heed the sourceThat flows for all, the fountain of his love,Which from the summit where he sits inthron'dPours health and joy, unailing streams, thro'outThe spacious region flourishing in view,The goodly work of his eternal day,His own fair universe, on which aloneHis counsels ix, and whence alone his willAssumes her strong direction. Such is nowHis sovran purpose, such it was beforeAll multitude of years: for his right armWas never idle; his bestowing loveKnew no beginning; was not as a changeOf mood that woke at last and started upAfter a deep and solitary slothOf boundless ages: no; he now is good;He ever was. The feet of hoary TimeThro' their eternal course have travell'd o'erNo speechless lifeless desert, but thro' scenesCheerful with bounty still, among a pompOf worlds for gladness round the Maker's throne
Loud shouting, or in many dialectsOf hope and filial trust imploring thenceThe fortunes of their people, where so fix'dWere all the dates of being, so dispos'dTo ev'ry living soul of ev'ry kindThe field of motion and the hour of rest,That each the gen'ral happiness might serve,And by the discipline of laws divineConvinc'd of folly or chastiz'd from guiltEach might at length be happy. What remainsShall be like what is pass'd, but fairer still,And still increasing in the godlike giftsOf life and truth. The same paternal handFrom the mute shellfish gasping on the shoreTo men, to angels, to celestial minds,Will ever lead the generations onThro' higher scenes of being, while supply'dFrom day to day by his enliv'ning breathInferiour orders in succession riseTo fill the void below. As flame ascends,As vapours to the earth in show'rs return,As the pois'd ocean tow'rd th' attracting moonSwells, and the ever list'ning planets charm'dBy the sun's call their onward pace incline,So all things which have life aspire to God,Exhaustless fount of intellectual day,Centre of souls! Nor doth the mast'ring voiceOf Nature cease within to prompt arightTheir steps, nor is the care of Heav'n withheld
From sending to the toil external aid,That in their stations all may persevereTo climb th' ascent of being, and approachFor ever nearer to the life divine.But this eternal fabrick was not rais'dFor man's inspection. Tho' to some be giv'nTo catch a transient visionary glimpseOf that majestick scene which boundless pow'rPrepares for perfect goodness, yet in vainWould human life her faculties expandT' imbosom such an object, nor could e'erVirtue or praise have touch'd the hearts of menHad not the Sovran Guide thro' ev'ry stageOf this their various journey pointed outNew hopes, new toils, which to their humble sphereOf sight and strength might such importance holdAs doth the wide creation to his own:Hence all the little charities of life,With all their duties, hence that fav'rite palmOf human will when duty is suffic'd,And still the lib'ral soul in ampler deedsWould manifest herself, that sacred signOf her rever'd affinity to himWhose bounties are his own, to whom none said"Create the wisest, fullest, fairest, world,"And make its offspring happy;" who intentSome likeness of himself among his worksTo view, hath pour'd into the human breastA ray of knowledge and of love which guides
Earth's feeble race to act their Maker's part,Self-judging, self-oblig'd, while from beforeThat godlike function the gigantick pow'rNecessity, tho' wont to curb the forceOf Chaos and the savage elements,Retires abash'd, as from a scene too highFor her brute tyranny, and with her bearsHer scorn'd followers Terrour and base Awe,Who blinds herself, and that ill-suited pair,Obedience link'd with Hatred. Then the soulArises in her strength, and looking roundHer busy sphere, whatever work she views,Whatever counsel, bearing any traceOf her Creator's likeness, whether aptTo aid her fellows or preserve herselfIn her superiour functions unimpair'd,Thither she turns exulting; that she claimsAs her peculiar good; on that thro' allThe fickle seasons of the day she looksWith rev'rence still; to that as to a senceAgainst affliction and the darts of painHer drooping hopes repair; and once oppos'dTo that all other pleasure, other wealth,Vile as the dross upon the molten goldAppears, and loathsome as the briny seaTo him who languishes with thirst and sighsFor some known fountain pure. For what can striveWith virtue? which of Nature's regions vastCan in so many forms produce to sight
Such pow'rful beauty? beauty which the eyeOf Hatred cannot look upon secure,Which Envy's self contemplates, and is turn'dEre long to tenderness, to infant smiles,Or tears of humblest love. Is aught so fairIn all the dewy landscapes of the spring,The summer's noontide groves, the purple eveAt harvest-home, or in the frosty moonGlitt'ring on some smooth sea, is aught so fairAs virtuous friendship? as the honour'd roofWhither from highest heav'n immortal LoveHis torch ethereal and his golden bowPropitious brings, and there a temple holdsTo whose unspotted service gladly vow'dThe social band of parent, brother, child,With smiles and sweet discourse and gentle deedsAdore his pow'r? What gift of richest climeE'er drew such eager eyes, or prompted suchDeep wishes, as the zeal that snatcheth backFrom Slander's pois'nous tooth a foe's renown,Or crosseth danger in his lion walkA rival's life to rescue? as the youngAthenian warriour sitting down in bondsThat his great father's body might not wantA peaceful, humble, tomb? the Roman wifeTeaching her lord how harmless was the woundOf death, how impotent the tyrant's rage,Who nothing more could threaten to afflictTheir faithful love? Or is there in th' abyss,
Is there among the adamantine spheresWheeling unshaken thro' the boundless voidAught that with half such majesty can fillThe human bosom as when Brutus roseRefulgent from the stroke of Caesar's sateAmid the crowd of patriots, and his armAloft extending, like eternal JoveWhen guilt brings down the thunder, call'd aloudOn Tully's name, and shook the crimson swordOf justice in his rapt astonish'd eye,And bad the father of his country Hail!For lo the tyrant prostrate on the dust,And Rome again is free? Thus thro' the pathsOf human life, in various pomp array'd,Walks the wise daughter of the Judge of Heav'n,Fair Virtue! from her Father's throne supremeSent down to utter laws such as on earthMost apt he knew, most pow'rful, to promoteThe weal of all his works, the gracious endOf his dread empire. And tho' haply man'sObscurer sight so far beyond himselfAnd the brief labours of his little homeExtends not, yet by the bright presence wonOf this divine instructress, to her swayPleas'd he assents, nor heeds the distant goalTo which her voice conducts him. Thus hath God,Still looking tow'rd his own high purpose, fix'dThe virtues of his creatures, thus he rulesThe parent's fondness and the patriot's zeal,
Thus the warm sense of honour and of shame,The vows of gratitude, the faith of love,And all the comely intercourse of praise,The joy of human life, the earthly heav'n.How far unlike them must the lot of guiltBe found! or what terrestrial wo can matchThe self-convicted bosom which hath wroughtThe bane of others, or enslav'd itselfWith shackles vile? Not poison nor sharp fire,Nor the worst pangs that ever monkish hateSuggested, or despotick Rage impos'd,Were at that season an unwish'd exchange,When the soul loathes herself, when flying thenceTo crowds on ev'ry brow she sees portray'dFell demons, Hate or Scorn, which drive her backTo solitude, her Judge's voice divineTo hear in secret, haply sounding thro'The troubled dreams of midnight, and still, stillDemanding for his violated lawsFit recompense, or charging her own tongueTo speak th' award of justice on herself;For well she knows what faithful hints withinWere whisper'd to beware the lying formsWhich turn'd her footsteps from the safer way,What cautions to suspect their painted dress,And look with steady eyelid on their smiles,Their frowns, their tears. In vain: the dazzling huesOf Fancy and Opinion's eager voice
Too much prevail'd; for mortals tread the pathIn which Opinion says they follow goodOr fly from evil; and Opinion givesReport of good or evil as the sceneWas drawn by Fancy, pleasing or deform'd:Thus her report can never there be trueWhere Fancy cheats the intellectual eyeWith glaring colours and distorted lines.Is there a man to whom the name of deathBrings terrour's ghastly pageants conjur'd upBefore him, deathbed groans and dismal vows,And the frail soul plung'd headlong from the brinkOf life and daylight down the gloomy airAn unknown depth to gulfs of tort'ring sireUnvisited by mercy? then what handCan snatch this dreamer from the fatal toilsWhich Fancy' and Opinion thus conspireTo twine around his heart? or who shall hushTheir clamour when they tell him that to die,To risk those horrours, is a direr curseThan basest life can bring? Tho' Love with pray'rsMost tender, with Affliction's sacred tears,Beseech his aid, tho' Gratitude and FaithCondemn each step which loiters, yet let noneMake answer for him that if any frownOf danger thwart his path he will not stayContent, and be a wretch to be secure.Here vice begins then: at the gate of life,Ere the young multitude to diverse roads
Part, like fond pilgrims on a journey unknown,Sits Fancy, deep enchantress! and to eachWith kind maternal looks presents her bowl,A potent bev'rage. Heedless they comply,Till the whole soul from that mysterious draughtIs ting'd, and ev'ry transient thought imbibesOf gladness or disgust, desire or fear,One homebred colour, which not all the lightsOf science e'er shall change, not all the stormsOf adverse fortune wash away, nor yetThe robe of purest virtue quite conceal,Thence on they pass, where meeting frequent shapesOf good and evil, cunning phantoms aptTo fire or freeze the breast, with them they joinIn dang'rous parley, list'ning oft', and oft'Gazing with reckless passion, while its garbThe spectre heightens, and its pompous taleRepeats with some new circumstance to suitThat early tincture of the hearer's soul.And should the guardian Reason but for oneShort moment yield to this illusive sceneHis ear and eye, th' intoxicating charmInvolves him, till no longer he discerns,Or only guides to err. Then revel forthA furious band that spurn him from the throne,And all is uproar: hence Ambition climbsWith sliding feet and hands impure to graspThose solemn toys which glitter in his viewOn Fortune's rugged steep; hence pale Revenge
Unsheaths her murd'rous dagger; Rapine hence,And envious Lust, by venal Fraud upborne,Surmount the rev'rend barrier of the laws,Which kept them from their prey: hence all the crimesThat e'er defil'd the earth, and all the plaguesThat follow them for vengeance, in the guiseOf honour, safety, pleasure, ease, or pomp,Stole first into the fond believing mind.Yet not by Fancy's witchcraft on the brainAre always the tumult'ous passions driv'nTo guilty deeds, nor Reason bound in chainsThat Vice alone may lord it: oft' adorn'dWith motley pageants Folly mounts his throne,And plays her idiot anticks like a queen.A thousand garbs she wears, a thousand waysShe whirls her giddy empire.—Lo! thus farWith hold adventure to the Mantuan lyreI sing for contemplation link'd with loveA pensive theme: now haply should my songUnbend that serious count'nance, and learnThalia's tripping gait, her shrill-ton'd voice,Her wiles familiar, whether scorn she dartsIn wanton ambush from her lip or eye,Or whether with a sad disguise of careO'ermantling her gay brow she acts in sportThe deeds of Folly, and from all sides roundCalls forth impetuous Laughter's gay rebuke,Her province. But thro' ev'ry comick sceneTo lead my Muse with her light pencil arm'd,
Thro' ev'ry swift occasion which the handOf Laughter points at when the mirthful stingDistends her lab'ring sides and chokes her tongue,Were endless as to sound each grating noteWith which the rooks and chatt'ring daws, and graveUnwieldy inmates of the village pond,The changing seasons of the sky proclaimSun, cloud, or show'r. Suffice it to have saidWhere'r the pow'r of Ridicule displaysHer quaint-ey'd visage some incongr'ous form,Some stubborn dissonance of things combin'd,Strikes on her quick perception, whether Pomp,Or Praise, or Beauty, be dragg'd in and shownWhere sordid fashions, where ignoble deeds,Where foul Deformity, is wont to dwell,Or whether these with shrewd and wayward spiteInvade resplendent Pomp's imperious mien,The charms of Beauty or the boast of Praise.Ask we for what fair end th' Almighty SireIn mortal bosoms stirs this gay contempt,These grateful pangs of laughter, from disgustEducing pleasure? Wherefore but to aidThe tardy steps of Reason, and at onceBy this prompt impulse urge us to depressWild Folly's aims? for tho' the sober lightOf Truth slow dawning on the watchful mindAt length unfolds thro' many a subtle tieHow these uncouth disorders end at last
In publick evil, yet benignant Heav'n,Conscious how dim the dawn of truth appearsTo thousands, conscious what a scanty pauseFrom labour and from care the wider lotOf humble life affords for studious thoughtTo scan the maze of Nature, therefore stamp'dThese glaring scenes with characters of scornAs broad, as obvious, to the passing clownAs to the letter'd sage's curious eye.But other evils o'er the steps of manThro' all his walks impend, against whose mightThe slender darts of laughter nought avail;A trivial warfare. Some like cruel guardsOn Nature's ever-moving throne attend,With mischief arm'd for him whoe'er shall thwartThe path of her inexorable wheels,While she pursues the work that must be doneThro' ocean, earth, and air: hence frequent formsOf wo, the merchant with his wealthy barkBury'd by dashing waves, the travellerPierc'd by the pointed lightning in his haste,And the poor husbandman with folded armsSurveying his lost labours and a heapOf blasted chaff, the product of the field,Whence he expected bread. But worse than theseI deem, far worse, that other race of illsWhich humankind rear up among themselves,That horrid offpring which misgovern'd WillBs to fantastick Errour; Vices, Crimes,
Furies that curse the earth, and make the blows,The heaviest blows, of Nature's innocent handSeem sport; which are indeed but as the careOf a wise parent, who solicits goodTo all her house, tho' haply at the priceOf tears, and froward wailing, and reproach,From some unthinking child, whom not the lessIts mother destines to be happy still.These sources then of pain, this double lotOf evil in th' inheritance of man,Requir'd for his protection no slight force,No careless watch, and therefore was his breastFenc'd round with passions quick to be alarm'd,Or stubborn to oppose; with fear more swiftThan beacons catching flame from hill to hillWhere armies land, with anger uncontroll'dAs the young lion bounding on his prey,With sorrow that locks up the struggling heart,And shame that overcasts the drooping eyeAs with a cloud of lightning. These the partPerform of eager monitors, and goadThe soul more sharply than with points of steelHer enemies to shun or to resist:And as those passions that converse with goodAre good themselves, as hope, and love, and joy,Among the fairest and the sweetest boonsOf life we rightly count, so these which guardAgainst invading evil still exciteSome pain, some tumult; these within the mind
Too oft' admitted or too long retain'dShock their frail eat, and by their uncurb'd rageTo savages more fell than Libya breedsTransform themselves, till human thought becomesA gloomy ruin, haunt of shapes unbless'd,Of self-tormenting fiends, Horrour, Despair,Hatred, and wicked Envy, foes to allThe works of Nature and the gifts of Heav'n.But when thro' blameless paths to righteous endsThose keener passions urge th' awaken'd soul,I would not as ungracious violenceTheir sway describe, nor from their free careerThe fellowship of Pleasure quite exclude:For what can render to the self-approv'dTheir temper void of comfort tho' in pain?Who knows not with what majesty divineThe forms of Truth and Justice to the mindAppear, ennobling oft' the sharpest woWith triumph and rejoicing? Who that bearsA human bosom hath not often feltHow dear are all those ties which bind our raceIn gentleness together, and how sweetTheir force, let Fortune's wayward hand the whileBe kind or cruel? Ask the faithful youthWhy the cold urn of her whom long he lov'dSo often fills his arms, so often drawsHis lonely footsteps silent and unseenTo pay the mournful tribute of his tears?Oh! he will tell thee that the wealth of worlds
Should ne'er seduce his bosom to foregoThose sacred hours when, stealing from the noiseOf care and envy, sweet remembrance soothsWith virtue's kindest looks his aking breast,And turns his tears to rapture. Ask the crowdWhich flies impatient from the village walkTo climb the neighb'ring cliffs when far belowThe savage winds have hurl'd upon the coastSome helpless bark, while holy Pity meltsThe gen'ral eye, or Terrour's icy handSmites their distorted limbs and horrent hair,While ev'ry mother closer to her breastCatcheth her child, and pointing where the wavesFoam thro' the shatter'd vessel, shrieks aloudAs one poor wretch who spreads his piteous armsFor succour swallow'd by the roaring surge,As now another dash'd against the rockDrops lifeless down. O! deemest thou indeedNo pleasing influence here by Nature giv'nTo mutual terrour and Compassion's tears?No tender charm mysterious which attractsO'er all that edge of pain the social pow'rsTo this their proper action and their end?Ask thy own heart when at the midnight hourSlow thro' that pensive gloom thy pausing eye,Led by the glimm'ring taper, moves aroundThe rev'rend volumes of the dead, the songsOf Grecian hards, and records writ by FameFor Grecian heroes, where the Sovran Pow'r
Of heav'n and earth surveys th' immortal page,Ev'n as a father meditating allThe praises of his son, and bids the restOf mankind there the fairest model learnOf their own nature, and the noblest deedsWhich yet the world hath seen: if then thy soulJoin in the lot of those diviner men,Say, when the prospect darkens on thy view,When sunk by many a wound heroick statesMourn in the dust, and tremble at the frownOf hard Ambition; when the gen'rous bandOf youths who fought for freedom and their firesLie side by side in death; when brutal ForceUsurps the throne of Justice, turns the pompOf guardian pow'r, the majesty of rule,The sword, the laurel, and the purple robe,To poor dishonest pageants, to adornA robber's walk, and glitter in the eyesOf such as bow the knee; when beauteous works,Rewards of virtue, sculptur'd forms, which deck'dWith more than human grace the warriour's archOr patriot's tomb now victims to appeaseTyrannick Envy strew the common pathWith awful ruins; when the Muses' haunt,The marble Porch where Wisdom wont to talkWith Socrates or Tully, hears no moreSave the hoarse jargon of contentious monks,Or fale Supetion's midnight pray'r;When ruthless Havock from the hand of Time
Tears the destroying sithe, with surer strokeTo mow the monuments of glory down,Till Desolation o'er the grass-grown streetExpands her raven wings, and from the gateWhere senates once the weal of nations plann'dHisseth the gliding snake thro' hoary weedsThat clasp the mould'ring column: thus when allThe widely mournful scene is fix'd withinThy throbbing bosom, when the patriot's tearStarts from thine eye, and thy extended armIn fancy, hurls the thunderbolt of JoveTo fire the impious wreath on Philip's brow,Or dash Octavius from the trophy'd car,Say, doth thy secret soul repine to tasteThe big distress? or wouldst thou then exchangeThose heart-ennobling sorrows for the lotOf him who sits amid the gaudy herdOf silent flatt'rers bending to his nod,And o'er them like a giant casts his eye,And says within himself, "I am a king,"And wherefore should the clam'rous voice of Wo"Intrude upon mine ear?" The dregs corruptOf barb'rous ages, that Circean draughtOf servitude and folly, have not yet,Bless'd be th' Eternal Ruler of the world!Yet have not so dishonour'd, so deform'd,The native judgment of the human soul,Nor so effac'd the image of her Sire.THE PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION.BOOK III.MDCCLXX.WHAT tongue then may explain the various fateWhich reigns o'er earth? or who to mortal eyesIllustrate this perplexing labyrinthOf joy and wo thro' which the feet of manAre doom'd to wander? That Eternal Mind,From passions, wants, and envy, far estrang'd;Who built the spacious universe, and deck'dEach part so richly with whate'er pertainsTo life, to health, to pleasure, why bad heThe viper Evil creeping in polluteThe goodly scene, and with insidious rage,While the poor inmate looks around and smiles,Dart her fell sting with poision to his soul?Hard is the question, and from ancient daysHath still oppress'd with care the sage's thought,Hath drawn forth accents from the poet's lyreToo sad, too deeply plaintive; nor did e'erThose chiefs of humankind from whom the lightOf heav'nly truth first gleam'd on barb'rous landsForget this dreadful secret when they toldWhat wondrous things had to their favour'd eyesAnd ears on cloudy mountain been reveal'd,Or in deep cave by nymph or pow'r divine,Portentous oft' and wild: yet one I know,
Could I the speech of lawgivers assume,One old and splendid tale I would recordWith which the Muse of Solon in sweet strainsAdorn'd this theme profound, and render'd allIts darkness, all its terrours, bright as noon,Or gentle as the golden star of eve.Who knows not Solon? last and wisest farOf those whom Greece triumphant in the heightOf glory styl'd her Fathers? him whose voiceThro' Athens hush'd the storm of civil wrath,Taught envious Want and cruel Wealth to joinIn friendship, and with sweet compalsion tam'dMinerva's eager people to his laws,Which their own goddess in his breast inspir'd?'Twas now the time when his heroick taskSeem'd but perform'd in vain, when sooth'd by yearsOf satt'ring service the fond multitudeHung with their sudden counsels on the breathOf great Pisistratus, that chief renown'dWhom Hermes and th' Idalian queen had train'dEv'n from his birth to ev'ry pow'rful artOf pleasing and persuading, from whose lipsFlow'd eloquence which like the vows of loveCould steal away suspicion from the heartsOf all who listen'd. Thus from day to dayHe won the gen'ral suff'rage, and beheldEach rival overshadow'd and depress'dBeneath his ampler state, yet oft' complain'd
As one less kindly treated who had hop'dTo merit favour, but submits perforceTo find another's services preferr'd,Nor yet relaxeth aught of faith or zeal.Then tales were scatter'd of his envious foes,Of snares that watch'd his fame, of daggers aim'dAgainst his life. At last with trembling limbs,His hair diffus'd and wild, his garments loose,And stain'd with blood from self-inflicted wounds,He burst into the publick place, as there,There only, were his refuge, and declar'dIn broken words, with sighs of deep regret,The mortal danger he had scarce repell'd.Fir'd with his tragick tale th' indignant crowdTo guard his steps forthwith a menial bandArray'd beneath his eye for deeds of warDecree: O still too lib'ral of their trustAnd oft' betray'd by over-grateful loveThe gen'rous people! Now behold him fenc'dBy mercenary weapons, like a kingForth issuing from the city gate at eveTo seek his rural mansion, and with pompCrowding the publick road. The swain stops short,And sighs, th' officious townsmen stand at gaze,And shrinking give the sullen pageant room.Yet not the less obsequious was his brow,Nor less profuse of courteous words his tongue,Of gracious gifts his hand, the while by stealth,Like a small torrent fed with ev'ning show'rs,
His train increas'd; till at that satal time,Just as the publick eye with doubt and shameStartled began to question what it saw,Swift as the sound of earthquakes rush'd a voiceThro' Athens that Pisistratus had fill'dThe rocky citadel with hostile arms,Had barr'd the steep ascent, and sat withinAmid his hirelings meditating deathTo all whose stubborn necks his yoke resus'd.Where then was Solon? After ten long yearsOf absence full of haste from foreign shoresThe sage, the lawgiver, had now arriv'd;Arriv'd, alas! to see that Athens, thatFair temple rais'd by him, and sacred call'dTo Liberty and Concord, now profan'dBy savage hate, or sunk into a denOf slaves who crouch beneath the master's scourge,And deprecate his wrath and court his chains.Yet did not the wise patriot's grief impedeHis virt'ous will, nor was his heart inclin'dOne moment with such womanlike distressTo view the transient storms of civil warAs thence to yield his country and her hopesTo all-devouring bondage. His bright helm,Ev'n while the traitor's impious act is told,He buckles on his hoary head, he girdsWith mail his stooping breast, the shield, the spear,He snatcheth, and with swift indignant strides
Wh assembled people seeks, proclaims aloudIt was no time for counsel, in their spearsLay all their prudence now; the tyrant yetWas not so firmly seated on his throneBut that one shock of their united forceWould dash him from the summit of his prideHeadlong and grov'lling in the dust. What elseCan reassert the lost Athenian name,So cheaply to the laughter of the worldBetray'd, by guile beneath an infant's faithSo mock'd and scorn'd? Away then; Freedom nowAnd Safety dwell not but with fame in arms;Myself will shew you where their mansion lies,And thro' the walks of danger or of deathConduct you to them. While he spake thro' allTheir crowded ranks his quick sagacious eyeHe darted, where no cheerful voice was heardOf social daring, no stretch'd arm was seenHast'ning their common task, but pale mistrustWrinkled each brow: theyshook their heads and downTheir slack hands hung: cold sighs and whisper'd doubtsFrom breath to breath stole round. The sage mean-timeLook'd speechless on, while his big bosom heav'dStruggling with shame and sorrow, till at lastA tear broke forth; and "O immortal Shades!"O Theseus!" he exclaim'd, "O Codrus! where,"Where are ye now? behold for what ye toil'd"Thro' life! behold for whom ye chose to die!"
No more he added, but with lonely stepsWeary and slow, his silver beard depress'd,And his stern eyes bent heedless on the ground,Back to his silent dwelling he repair'd;There o'er the gate his armour, as a manWhom from the service of the war his chiefDismisseth after no inglorious toil,He fix'd in gen'ral view: one wishful lookHe sent unconscious tow'rd the publick placeAt parting, then beneath his quiet roofWithout a word, without a sigh, retir'd.Scarce had the morrow's sun his golden raysFrom sweet Hymettus darted o'er the fanesOf Cecrops to the Salaminian shoresWhen lo! on Solon's threshold met the feetOf four Athenians, by the same sad careConducted all, than whom the state beheldNone nobler. First came Megacles, the sonOf great Alemeon, whom the Lydian king,The mild unhappy Croesus, in his daysOf glory had with costly gifts adorn'd,Fair vessels, splendid garments, tinctur'd webs,And heaps of treasur'd gold beyond the lotOf many sovrans, thus requiting wellThat hospitable favour which erewhileAlemeon to his messengers had shewn,Whom he with off'rings worthy of the godSent from his throne in Sardis to revere
Apollo's Delphick shrine. With MegaclesApproach'd his son, whom Agarista bore,The virtuous child of Clisthenes, whose handOf Grecian sceptres the most ancient farIn Sicyon sway'd; but greater fame he drewFrom arms controll'd by justice, from the loveOf the wise Muses, and the unenvy'd wreathWhich gla Olympia gave; for thither onceHis warlike steeds the hero led, and thereContended thro' the tumult of the courseWith skilful wheels. Then victor at the goalAmid th' applauses of assembled GreeceHigh on his car he stood, and wav'd his arm:Silence ensu'd, when straight the herald's voiceWas heard inviting ev'ry Grecian youth,Whom Clisthenes content might call his son,To visit ere twice thirty days were pass'dThe towers of Sicyon. There the chief decreedWithin the circuit of the following yearTo join at Hymen's altar hand in handWith his fair daughter him among the guestsWhom worthiest he should deem. Forthwith from allThe bounds of Greece th' ambitious wooers came;From rich Hesperia, from th' Illyrian shore,Where Epidamnus over Adria's surgeLooks on the setting sun, from those brave tribesChaonian or Molossian whom the raceOf great Achilles governs, glorying stillIn Troy o'erthrown, from rough Aetolia, nurse
Of men who first among the Greeks threw offThe yoke of kings, to commerce and to armsDevoted, from Thessalia's fertile meads,Where flows Peneus near the lofty wallsOf Cranon old, from strong Eretria, queenOf all Euboean cities, who sublimeOn the steep margin of Euripus viewsAcross the tide the Marathonian plain,Not yet the haunt of glory; Athens too,Minerva's care, among her graceful sonsFound equal lovers for the princely maid;Nor was proud Argos wanting, nor the domesOf sacred Elis, nor th'Arcadian grovesThat overshade Alpheus, echoing oft'Some shepherd's song. But thro' th' illustrious bandWas none who might with Megacles compareIn all the honours of unblemish'd youth.His was the beauteous bride; and now their son,Young Clisthenes, betimes at Solon's gateStood anxious, leaning forward on the armOf his great sire, with earnest eyes that ask'dWhen the slow hinge would turn, with restless feet,And cheeks now pale, now glowing; for his heartThrobb'd, full of bursting passions, anger, grief,With scorn imbitter'd, by the gen'rous boyScarce understood, but which, like noble seeds,Are destin'd for his country and himselfIn riper years to bring forth fruits divineOf liberty and glory. Next appear'd
Two brave companions, whom one mother boreTo diff'rent lords, but whom the better tiesOf firm esteem and friendship render'd moreThan brothers; first Miltiades, who drewFrom godlike Aeacus his ancient line,That Aeacus whose unimpeach'd renownFor sanctity and justice won the lyreOf elder bards to celebrate him thron'dIn Hades o'er the dead, where his decreesThe guilty soul within the burning gatesOf Tartarus compel, or send the goodT' inhabit with eternal health and peaceThe vallies of Elysium. From a stemSo sacred ne'er could worthier scion springThan this Miltiades, whose aid ere longThe chiefs of Thrace, already on their waysSent by th' inspir'd foreknowing maid who sitsUpon the Delphick tripod, shall imploreTo wield their sceptre, and the rural wealthOf fruitful Chersonesus to protectWith arms and laws: but nothing careful nowSave for his injur'd country, here he standsIn deep solicitude with Cimon join'd,Unconscious both what widely diff'rent lotsAwait them, taught by Nature as they areTo know one common good, one common ill:For Cimon not his valour, not his birth,Deriv'd from Codrus, not a thousand giftsDealt round him with a wise benignant hand,
No, not th' Olympick olive, by himselfFrom his own brow transferr'd to sooth the mindOf this Pisistratus, can long preserveFrom the sell envy of the tyrant's sonsAnd their assassin dagger. But if deathObscure upon his gentle steps attend;Yet Fate an ample recompense preparesIn his victorious son, that other greatMiltiades who o'er the very throneOf glory shall with Time's assiduous handIn adamantine characters engraveThe name of Athens, and by Freedom arm'd'Gainst the gigantick pride of Asia's kingShall all th' achievements of the heroes oldSurmount, of Hercules, of all who sail'dFrom Thessaly with Jason, all who foughtFor empire or for fame at Thebes or Troy.Such were the patriots who within the porchOf Solon had assembled: but the gateNow opens, and across the ample floorStraight they proceed into an open spaceBright with the beams of morn, a verdant spot,Where stands a rural altar pil'd with sodsCut from the grassy turf, and girt with wreathsOf branching palm. Here Solon's self they foundClad in a robe of purple pure, and deck'dWith leaves of olive on his rev'rend brow.He bow'd before the altar, and o'er cakesOf barley from two earthen vessels pour'd
Of honey and of milk a plenteous stream,Calling mean-time the Muses to acceptHis simple off'ring, by no victim ting'dWith blood, nor sully'd by destroying fire,But such as for himself Apollo claimsIn his own Delos, where his fav'rite hauntIs thence the altar of the Pious nam'd.Unseen the guests drew near, and silent view'dThat worship, till the hero priest his eyeTurn'd tow'rd a seat on which prepar'd there layA branch of laurel; then his friends confess'dBefore him stood. Backward his step he drew,As loth that care or tumult should approachThose early rites divine; but soon their looksSo anxious, and their hands held forth with suchDesponding gesture, bring him on perforceTo speak to their affliction. "Are ye come,"He cry'd, "to mourn with me this common shame?"Or ask ye some new effort which may break"Our fetters? Know then of the publick cause"Not for yon' traitor's cunning or his might"Do I despair; nor could I wish from Jove"Aught dearer than at this late hour of life"As once by laws so now by strenuous arms"From impious violation to assert"The rights our fathers left us. But, alas!"What arms? or who shall wield them? Ye beheld"Th' Athenian people. Many bitter days"Must pass, and many wounds from cruel Pride
"Be felt, ere yet their partial hearts find room"For just resentment, or their hands endure"To smite this tyrant brood, so near to all"Their hopes, so oft' admir'd, so long belov'd."That time will come however. Be it yours"To watch its fair approach, and urge it on"With honest prudence: me it ill beseems"Again to supplicate th unwilling crowd"To rescue from a vile deceiver's hold"That envy'd pow'r which once with eager zel"They offer'd to myself; nor can I plunge"In counsels deep and various, nor prepare"For distant wars, thus falt'ring as I tread"On life's last verge, ere long to join the shades"Of Minos and Lycurgus. But behold"What care employs me now. My vows I pay"To the sweet Muses, teachers of my youth,"And solace of my age. If right I deem"Of the still voice that whispers at my heart"Th' immortal Sisters have not quite withdrawn"Their old harmonious influence. Let your tongues"With sacred silence favour what I speak,"And haply shall my faithful lips be taught"T' unfold celestial counsels, which may arm"As with impenetrable steel your breasts"For the long strife before you, and repel"The darts of adverse Fate." He said, and snatch'dThe laurel bough, and sat in silence down,Fix'd, wrapp'd in solemn musing, full before
The sun, who now from all his radiant orbDrove the grey clouds, and pour'd his genial lightUpon the breast of Solon. Solon rais'dAloft the leasy rod, and thus began:"Ye beauteous offspring of Olympian Jove"And Memory divine, Pierian Maids!"Hear me propitious. In the morn of life,"When hope shone bright and all the prospect smil'd,"To your sequester'd mansion oft' my steps"Were turn'd, O Muses! and within your gate"My off'rings paid. Ye taught me then with strains"Of flowing harmony to soften War's"Dire voice, or in fair colours that might charm"The publick eye to clothe the form austere"Of civil counsel. Now my feeble age"Neglected, and supplanted of the hope"On which it lean'd, yet sinks not, but to you,"To your mild wisdom, flies, refuge belov'd"Of solitude and silence Ye can teach"The visions of my bed whate'er the gods"In the rude ages of the world inspir'd,"Or the first herdes acted; ye can make"The morning light more gladsome to my sense"Than ever it appear'd to active youth"Pursuing careless pleasure; ye can give"To this long leisure, these unheeded hours,"A labour as sublime as when the sons"Of Athens throng'd and speechless round me stood
"To hear pronounc'd for all their future deeds"The bounds of right and wrong. Celestial Pow'rs!"I feel that ye are near me; and behold"To meet your energy divine I bring"A high and sacred theme, not less than those"Which to th' eternal custody of Fame"Your lips intrusted, when of old ye deign'd"With Orpheus or with Homer to frequent"The groves of Hemus or the Chian shore."Ye know, harmonious Maids! (for what of all"My various life was e'er from you estrang'd?)"Oft' hath my solitary song to you"Reveal'd that duteous pride which turn'd my steps"To willing exile, earnest to withdraw"From envy and the disappointed thirst"Of lucre, lest the bold familiar strife"Which in the eye of Athens they upheld"Against her legislator should impair"With trivial doubt the rev'rence of his laws:"To Egypt therefore thro' th' Aegean isles"My course I steer'd, and by the banks of Nile"Dwelt in Canopus: thence the hallow'd domes"Of Sais, and the rites to Isis paid,"I sought, and in her temple's silent courts"Thro' many changing moons attentive heard"The venerable Sonchis, while his tongue"At morn or midnight the deep story told"Of her who represents whate'er has been,
"Or is, or shall be, whose mysterious veil"No mortal hand hath ever yet remov'd."By him exhorted southward to the walls"Of On I pass'd, the city of the Sun,"The ever youthful god: 't was there amid"His priests and sages, who the livelong night"Watch the dread movements of the starry sphere,"Or who in wondrous fables half disclose"The secrets of the elements, it was there"That great Psenophis taught my raptur'd ears"The same of old Atlantis, of her chiefs,"And her pure laws, the first which earth obey'd."Deep in my bosom sunk the noble tale,"And often while I listen'd did my mind"Foretel with what delight her own free lyre"Should some time for an Attick audience raise"Anew that losty scene, and from their tombs"Call forth those ancient demigods to speak"Of justice and the hidden providence"That walks among mankind. But yet mean-time"The mystick pomp of Ammon's gloomy sons"Became less pleasing: with contempt I gaz'd"On that tame garb and those unvarying paths"To which the double yoke of king and priest"Had cramp'd the sullen race. At last with hymns"Invoking our own Pallas and the gods"Of cheerful Greece, a glad farewell I gave"To Egypt, and before the southern wind"Spread my full fails. What climes I then survey'd,
"What fortunes I encounter'd in the realm"Of Croesus, or upon the Cyprian shore,"The Muse who prompts my bosom doth not now"Consent that I reveal. But when at length"Ten times the sun returning from the south"Hadstrow'dwith flow'rs the verdant earth, and fill'd"The groves with musick, pleas'd I then beheld"The term of those long errours drawing nigh."Nor yet, I said, will I sit down within"The walls of Athens till my seet have trod"The Cretan soil, have pierc'd those rev'rend haunts"Whence Law and civil Concord issu'd forth"As from their ancient home, and still to Greece"Their wisest loftiest discipline proclaim."Straight where Amnisus, mart of wealthy ships,"Appears beneath sam'd Gnossus and her tow'rs,"Like the fair handmaid of a stately queen,"I check'd my prow, and thence with eager steps"The city' of Minos enter'd. O ye Gods!"Who taught the leaders of the simpler time"By written words to curb the untow'rd will"Of mortals, how within that gen'rous isle"Have ye the triumphs of your pow'r display'd"Munificent! Those splendid merchants, lords"Of traffick and the sea, with what delight"I saw them at their publick meal, like sons"Of the same household, join the plainer sort,"Whose wealth was only freedom! whence to those
"Vile envy and to those fantastick pride"Alike was strange, but noble concord still"Cherish'd the strength untam'd, the rustick faith,"Of their first fathers. Then the growing race"How pleasing to behold them in their schools,"Their sports, their labours, ever plac'd within"O shade of Minos! thy controlling eye?"Here was a docile band in tuneful tones"Thy laws pronouncing, or with lofty hymns"Praising the bounteous gods, or to preserve"Their country's heroes from oblivious night"Resounding what the Muse inspir'd of old:"There on the verge of manhood others met"In heavy armour thro' the heats of noon"To march, the rugged mountain's height to climb"With measur'd swiftness, from the hardbent bow"To send resistless arrows to their mark,"Or for the fame of prowess to contend,"Now wrestling, now with fists and staves oppos'd,"Now with the biting falchion, and the fence"Of brazen shields, while still the warbling flute"Presided o'er the combat, breathing strains"Grave, solemn, soft, and changing headlong spite"To thoughtful resolution cool and clear."Such I beheld those islanders renown'd,"So tutor'd from their birth to meet in war"Each bold invader, and in peace to guard"That living flame of rev'rence for their laws"Which nor the storms of Fortune nor the flood
"Of foreign wealth diffus'd o'er all the land"Could quench or slacken. First of human names"In ev'ry Cretan's heart was Minos still,"And holiest far of what the sun surveys"Thro' his whole course were those primeval seats"Which with religious footsteps he had taught"Their sires t' approach, the wild Dictean cave"Where Jove was born, the ever verdant meads"Of Ida, and the spacious grotto where"His active youth he pass'd, and where his throne"Yet stands mysterious, whither Minos came"Each ninth returning year the king of gods"And mortals there in secret to consult"On justice, and the tables of his law"T' inscribe anew: oft' also with like zeal"Great Rhea's mansion from the Gnossian gates"Men visit, nor less oft' the antick fane"Built on that sacred spot along the banks"Of shady Theron where benignant Jove"And his majestick consort join'd their hands"And spoke their nuptial vows. Alas! it was there"That the dire same of Athens sunk in bonds"I first receiv'd, what time an annual feast"Had summon'd all the genial country round"By sacrifice and pomp to bring to mind"That first great spousal, while th' enamour'd youths"And virgins with the priest before the shrine"Observe the same pure ritual, and invoke"The same glad omens. There among the crowd"Of strangers from those naval cities drawn
"Which deck like gems the island's northern shore"A merchant of Aegina I descry'd,"My ancient host; but forward as I sprung"To meet him he with dark dejected brow"Stopp'd half averse; and "O Athenian guest!""He said, "art thou in Crete these joyful rites"Partaking? Know thy laws are blotted out;"Thy Country kneels before a tyrant's throne.""He added names of men, with hostile deeds"Disastrous, which obscure and indistinct"I heard, for while he spake my heart grew cold"And my eyes dim; the altars and their train"No more were present to me: how I far'd"Or whither turn'd I know not, nor recall"Aught of those moments other than the sense"Of one who struggles in oppressive sleep,"And from the toils of some distressful dream"To break away, with palpitating heart,"Weak limbs, and temples bath'd in deathlike dew,"Makes many a painful effort. When at last"The sun and Nature's face again appear'd"Not far I found me, where the publick path"Winding thro' cypress groves and swelling meads"From Gnossus to the cave of Jove ascends:"Heedless I follow'd on till soon the skirts"Of Ida rose before me, and the vault"Wide-op'ning pierc'd the mountain's rocky side."Ent'ring within the threshold on the ground"I slung me, sad, faint, overworn with toil.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *THE BEGINNING OF THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION.MDCCLXX.ONE effort more, one cheerful sally more,Our destin'd course will finish; and in peaceThen for an off'ring sacred to the pow'rsWho lent us gracious guidance we will thenInscribe a monument of deathless praise,O my advent'rous Song!

Who now her tender discipline obey,Where dwell ye? what wild river's brink at eveImprint your steps? what solemn groves at noonUse ye to visit, often breaking forthIn rapture 'mid your dilatory walk,Or musing as in slumber on the green?—Would I again were with you!—O ye DalesOf Tyne! and ye most ancient Woodlands! whereOft' as the giant flood obliquely stridesAnd his banks open and his lawns extendStops short the pleased traveller to viewPresiding o'er the scene some rustick tow'rFounded by Norman or by Saxon hands;O ye Northumbrian Shades! which overlookThe rocky pavement and the mossy fallsOf solitary Wensbeck's limpid stream,How gladly I recall your wellknown seatsBelov'd of old, and that delightful timeWhen all alone for many a summer's dayI wander'd thro' your calm recesses, ledIn silence by some pow'rful hand unseen.Nor will I e'er forget you; nor shall e'erThe graver tasks of manhood or th' adviceOf vulgar wisdom move me to disclaimThose studies which possess'd me in the dawnOf life, and fix'd the colour of my mindFor ev'ry future year; whence even nowFrom sleep I rescue the clear hours of morn,
And while the world around lies overwhelm'dIn idle darkness am alive to thoughtsOf honourable fame, of truth divineOr moral, and of minds to virtue wonBy the sweet magick of harmonious verse,The themes which now expect us. For thus farOn gen'ral habits, and on arts which growSpontaneous in the minds of all mankind,Hath dwelt our argument; and how selftaught,Tho' seldom conscious of their own employ,In Nature's or in Fortune's changeful sceneMen learn to judge of beauty, and acquireThose forms set up as idols in the soulFor love and zealous praise. Yet indistinctIn vulgar bosoms and unnotic'd lieThese pleasing stores, unless the casual forceOf things external prompt the heedless mindTo recognize her wealth. But some there areConscious of Nature and the rule which manO'er Nature holds; some who within themselvesRetiring from the trivial scenes of chanceAnd momentary passion can at willCall up these fair exemplars of the mind,Review their features, scan the secret lawsWhich bind them to each other, and displayBy forms, or sounds, or colours, to the senseOf all the world, their latent charms display;Ev'n as in Nature's frame (if such a word,If such a word, so bold, may from the lips
Of man proceed) as in this outward frameOf things the Great Artificer portraysHis own immense idea. Various namesThse among mortals bear, as various signsThey use, and by peculiar organs speakTo human sense. There are who by the flightOf air thro' tubes with moving stops distinct,Or by extended chords in measure taughtTo vibrate, can assemble pow'rful soundsExpressing ev'ry temper of the mindFrom ev'ry cause, and charming all the soulWith passion void of care: others mean-timeThe rugged mass of metal, wood, or stone,Patiently taming, or with easier handDescribing lines, and with more ample scopeUniting colours, can to gen'ral sightProduce those permanent and perfect forms,Those characters of heroes and of gods,Which from the crude materials of the worldTheir own high minds created. But the chiefAre poets, eloquent men, who dwell on earthTo clothe whate'er the soul admires or lovesWith language and with numbers: hence to theseA field is open'd wide as Nature's sphere,Nay wider; various as the sudden actsOf human wit, and vast as the demandsOf human will. The bard nor length, nor depth,Nor place, nor form, controls. To eyes, to ears,To ev'ry organ of the copious mind,
He offereth all its treasures. Him the hours,The seasons him, obey; and changeful TimeSees him at will keep measure with his flight,At will outstrip it. To enhance his toilHe summoneth from th' uttermost extentOf things which God hath taught him ev'ry formAuxiliar, ev'ry pow'r, and all besideExcludes imperious. His prevailing handGives to corporeal essence life and sense,And ev'ry stately function of the soul.The soul itself to him obsequious lies,Like matter's passive heap, and as he willsTo reason and affection he assignsTheir just alliances, their just degrees;Whence his peculiar honours, whence the raceOf men who people his delightful world,Men genuine and according to themselves,Transcend as far th' uncertain sons of earthAs earth itself to his delightful worldThe palm of spotless beauty doth resign.* * * * * * * * *CONTENTS.The Life of the Author, Page 5Advertisement, 17The Design, 20The Pleasures of Imagination, Book I. 25The Pleasures of Imagination, Book II. 51The Pleasures of Imagination, Book III. 83General Argument to the Pleasures of Imagination enlarged, 114The Pleasures of Imagination enlarged, Book I. 116The Pleasures of Imagination enlarged, Book II. 143The Pleasures of Imagination enlarged, Book III. 168Beginning of Book IV. 187From the APOLLO PRESS, by the MARTINS, Nov. . 1781.END OF VOLUME FIRST.BELL'S EDITION.
