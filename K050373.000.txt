THE MAGIC PICTURE, A PLAY.[ALTERED FROM MASSINGER.]BY THE REV. H. BATE.—Beware of JEALOUSY!It is a green-ey'd Monster, which doth mockThe meat it feeds on!—SHAKESPEAR.LONDON: Printed for T. and J. EGERTON, Charing-cross; T. DAVIES, Russell-street, Covent-garden; KEARSLEY, Fleet-street; E. MACKLEW, Haymarket; and R. BALDWIN, Paternoster-row, 1783. PRICE ONE SHILLING AND SIXPENCE.DEDICATION. TO JOHN STRUTT, ESQ. MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR MALDON.DEAR SIR,MY admiration of your unfeigned patriotism, was not excited, but confirmed by that singular, and manly instance, which made you revered by all, who could feel for the tarnished glory of their country!—To that public virtue in the individual I esteem, this Play is disinterestedly inscribed.—I am, Sir, With great truth and regard, Your sincere, and Obedient servant H. BATE.BRADWELL-LODGE, Nov: 13th, 1783.ADVERTISEMENT.TO prepare MASSINGER'S Tragi-Comedy, THE PICTURE, for a modern entertainment, proved a more arduous task than was at first conceived. After giving a different turn to the drama, by making the changes of the Picture, the effects of Eugenius's jealousy, instead of the magic art of Baptista, and expunging the gross indelicacies which overran the play, it was found that most of the characters required a little fresh modelling to complete the design of the present undertaking. Hence the necessity of new-writing no inconsiderable part of the dialogue, in imitation of the old Dramatist. Though enamoured with the beauties of the antique structure, the Alterer set about its reparation with the utmost dissidence, fearing, like an unskilful architect, he might destroy those venerable features he could not improve! What has been his success, the public decision must determine.The same kind of irregular and broken measure, through necessity still prevails, except where the language could be reduced to the heroic verse without impairing the spirit of the dialogue.
As to the unities,—being so totally disregarded by MASSINGER himself, no use could possibly be made of them in the present alteration.The performance of the MAGIC PICTURE was every thing that an Author could expect, or wish for. The friendship and liberality of Mr. HARRIS were zealously exerted on the occasion. Mr. SHIELD aided it with his harmonic powers; and every performer, by a well sustained character, united in it's support: but Miss YOUNGE'S SOPHIA was too striking a representation not to demand a particular acknowledgment.—To this fortunate combination of talents, THE MAGIC PICTURE chiefly stands indebted for the very flattering reception with which it has been honored!London,Nov. 17, 1783.PROLOGUE,Spoken by Mr. AICKIN, in the Character of the Ghost of MASSINGER.WRITTEN BY W. PEARCE, ESQ.[A Bell tolls.]REGARDLESS of yon bell, which strikes mine ear,I, troubled shade of Massinger, appear!— [Ghost rises.What frenzy cou'd impel the daring thought,To seize the PIECE my lab'ring fancy wrought?The PICTURE glowing with selected dies?—O 'tis a deed to make a Spirit rise!But why shou'd I meet favor from an age,That martyrs even Shakespear in its rage?How late had princely Hamlet cause to rave!—Depriv'd of clowns to dig Ophelia's grave!Where was the skull, whose fate remembrance wept?And where the turf, on which poor Yorick slept?By temp'rance sooth'd, each murmur here shall end:'Tis dang'rous with a Gownsman to contend;—One, charter'd over spirits giv'n to riot,Whose pow'r can lay me in the Red-sea quiet!For now I'm quite bereft of Magic arms;And what could Merlin do without his charms!The Sorc'rers art is lost—And yet this ageExceeds the feats of Royal James's Demonologia, a treatise written by James the First. page!He wrote of wizzards visiting the moon;—But what are broomsticks to an air balloon!Not all the scenes, describ'd by Tasso's verse,Where Daemons met, their rituals to rehearse,Could match the horrors of that crimson day,When ELLIOT'S machinations were at play!And the Enchanter, CURTIS, whirl'd amain,By spells of fire, the batteries of Spain!But soft!—The brazen voice of War is mute;And sounds of Peace are heard in each salute!View me, then, as an herald of her way;And in this wreath, the olive crown survey!Bend with obedience to her soft'ning strains;Nor arm against poor Massinger's remains!Dramatis Personae.EUGENIUSMr. WROUGHTON.LADISLAUSMr. WHITFIELD.EUBULUSMr. CLARKE.BAPTISTAMr. HULL.FERDINANDMr. DAVIES.UBALDOMr. EDWIN.RICARDOMr. WILSON.HILLARIOMr. QUICK.HONORIAMrs. BATES.CORISCAMrs. WILSON.ACANTHEMiss PLATT.SOPHIAMiss YOUNGE.COURTIERS, MASQUES, RUFFIANS, &c.
THE MAGIC PICTURE.ACT I.SCENE I.The Curtain rising, discovers HILLARIO asleep at the foot of an old Oak.Enter CORISCA.CORISCA.HILLARIO! arise, I say!Nor any longer let the laughing sunImprint a burning shame upon thy forehead.[HILLARIO rises.Look, if you are a man, and see their tender parting:What sighs and countless kisses they've exchang'd,And full as quick as my poor heart repeats 'em.HILLARIO.You should be let blood Corisca!Love's raging fever is abroad, my girl:Let's feel thy pulse! one, two, three, four!Ay, galloping like mad, as I suspected!Why, thou hast all the symptoms of the malady!CORISCA.[Placing his hand on his forehead.Count there, my busy Doctor, and you'll findThe pulse of folly wildly beat! for shame!Thou wert not wont, Hillario, to be blind:I marvel, would you prosper in the world,That you your betters do not imitate. [Pointing behind to EUGENIUS and SOPHIA.HILLARIO.Imitation! 'tis but a scurvy business at the best,And in kissing it savours still more vilely,Lacking the spirit that should keep it warm.CORISCA.Peace, they approach!HILLARIO.Mute as a pickled sturgeon.Enter EUGENIUS (in a warlike habit) and SOPHIA.EUGENIUS.Since we must part, my love, farther to passIs not alone unwise, but even dangerous;For on yon frontier height, the Turkish campExtends 'twixt us and the Hungarian line:Be now discreet as ever, and pr'ythee wedThy understanding to thy constant patience!SOPHIA.You put it to the utmost trial now. [Weeping.EUGENIUS.Nay, no melting;For the necessity that thus divides us,Full oft have we recounted, and the causeWash'd with our blended tears.SOPHIA.If blest the hour that ratified our union,How can Eugenius leave me?EUGENIUS.Not as some think, for mere desire of fame,Or to be cry'd up by the public voiceFor a brave soldier, do I appear in arms:Such airy humours strike not me: Alas!Too well thou know'st, with what a scanty handFortune has dealt out our demeans; 'tis sheEnjoins it.SOPHIA.In you alone, my lord,I've all abundance!EUGENIUS.In your own language I would answer you,For thou hast been a right obedient wife:And to my power (tho' short of your desert)I hope I have not fail'd in th' indulgent husband.We have long enjoy'd the sweets of love;Yet, my Sophia,We must not live such dotards in our pleasures,As still to hug them to a certain loss.SOPHIA.Have you in meFound any sign of discontent, my lord?EUGENIUS.No my Sophia,Nor shalt thou e'er have reason to repentThy constant course in goodness, if heav'n smileUpon my honest undertakings. 'Tis for theeThat I turn soldier, and cheerfully embarkUpon this sea of action, there to tradeFor rich materials; nobly to adornThy lovely person; and to th' admiring worldDisplay it in full lustre. Oft I've blush'dThat other ladies, inferior ev'n in beautyAnd outward form, but in the harmony
Of the soul's ravishing music not to be nam'dWith thee, in splendour should outshine thee,While you, devoid of these, past unregarded.SOPHIA.If I'm so rich in your opinion, why for meWould you additions borrow?EUGENIUS.Why? Should I not be justly censuredOf ignorance, possessing such a jewelAbove all price, if I forbore to give itThe best of ornaments? Therefore, Sophia,In few words, know my pleasure, and as brieflyAs you have ever done, obey me; to your discretionI leave the government of my family,And our poor fortunes: to the uttermostOf what is mine, live plentifully,And ere the remnant of our store be spent,I hope, with my good sword, to reap for youA harvest, that shall make a merry winter.SOPHIA.Since you are notTo be by me diverted from your purpose,Go when you please, my poor impatient soulMust follow after you. To tell you,What in your absence I will do, would shewBut poorly; my actions best will speak it.—It were to doubt your love, should I requestThat I might hear from you; but by night or day,No courier, unexamin'd, shall pass by.—Adieu! [throwing herself in his arms.If thus within your arms I dwell too long,Think of the cruel fast that must succeedThis short dear feast, and you'll excuse it.Pray turn from me, all that I can is spoken![Exit SOPHIA.EUGENIUS.Follow thy mistress strait, Corisca;Forbear your wishes for me. Those let me findAt my return, in your prompt will to serve her.HILLARIO.Fly, Corisca.For my own poor part, Sir, I will grow lean with hard studyTo make my mistress merry.(Exeunt HILLARIO and CORISCA.EUGENIUS.I'm strangely troubled! yet why nourish thusA fury here, and with imagin'd food,Having no real grounds on which to raiseA doubt she ever was, or can be false?In this, I do but foolishly enquireThe knowledge of a future sorrow. [Muses.Enter BAPTISTA.BAPTISTA.(Aside.) Still brooding o'er imaginary illsWhich Fate herself might ne'er decree—My schemeMay cool this self-rais'd fever in his mind,If to that credit I have gain'd in th' arts,Credulity but lend the lover's ear;Friendship at least approves of the device.EUGENIUS.I've consulted with a friend of mine,One deeply read in Nature's hidden secrets;And, tho' with much reluctance, him have wonTo do as much as Art enables himTo resolve me of my future fate. [Seeing BAPTISTA.Here to my wish he comes.Now, my Baptista!BAPTISTA.If you canProportion your desire to any mean,
I'd pronounce you happy. I have foundBy certain rules of Art, your matchless wifeIs to the present hour unspotted.EUGENIUS.Good!BAPTISTA.In reason, therefore, you should be content,And make no search of what may fall hereafter.EUGENIUS.O Baptista!'Tis not in me to master so my passions.I must know farther, or you have made goodBut half your promise. While my Love stood byHolding her's upright—how, thus untempted,Could she give proof of well-tried constancy?But when I'm absent, and my coming backUncertain—she, without controul or curb,The absolute disposer of herself—nay, more,By strong temptations press'd on ev'ry side—If then she holds out—BAPTISTA.As no doubt she will:EUGENIUS.These doubts must be made certaintiesBy your assurance, or your boasted ArtWill lose its admiration.BAPTISTA.I cannot dive into her hidden thoughts,And learn her close intents, with all my skill;But what I can, I readily will do.—Will it content you, if, while distant far,You there shall know, as if you then were with her,When, and how far, by Love, she e'er be wrought on?EUGENIUS.I ask no more.BAPTISTA.Take then this little model of Sophia,With more than human skill pourtray'd;Each line and lineament of the drawingSo punctually observ'd, that, had it motion,'Twould ev'n dispute originality with her. [Gives him the Miniature.EUGENIUS.It is indeed an admirable piece!Whence came it?BAPTISTA.Of that no matter now—EUGENIUS.But if it have not some concealed charmOf which I know not, wherefore must I bearHer lovely counterfeit?BAPTISTA.I'll instruct you:Carry it still about you, and as oftAs you have wish to know how she's affected,With curious eye peruse it: while it holdsThe beauteous image that it now presentsEntire and perfect, know that she remainsNot only innocent, but unattempted.But if th' harmonious colouring should change,And, from its softly blended white and red,Incline to jealous yellow, rest assur'dShe is with ardor woo'd, tho' yet unconquer'd.Should it assume a fatal sable hue,Her virtue, and your honor, are no more!EUGENIUS.Thanks, my Baptista.So much have you engag'd me by this favor,That the service of my life will scarce repay it.Adieu!BAPTISTA.Not yet; for I have more t' impart:That as we ride along; for I'm not quite so old,But I may see you join th' Hungarian troops,And with the rising Sun behold the conflict.EUGENIUS.As my better angel then,You shall direct and guide me!—Come.Our chargers there.[Exeunt EUGENIUS and BAPTISTA.SCENE II.The COURT of LADISLAUS.Enter UBALDO and RICARDO.RICARDO.Came the courier from the camp last night?UBALDO.Yes, as 'tis said, with a letterFrom the General Ferdinand.RICARDO.Sans question then it is of moment?UBALDO.To those who carry lives in either army.RICARDO.Was it chearfully received by the King?UBALDO.So, so:—soon however as assur'dThe lines approach'd within each other's view,
He dispatch'd an officer to Ferdinand,With absolute authority from him,To try the fortune of the day.RICARDO.The General then, no doubt, will fight it bravely.Heav'n prosper him! This military artI grant to be the noblest of professions;And yet, I thank my stars! I never wasInclin'd to learn it; for that bubble honor,The pretty nothing for which these soldiers fight,Is, in my judgment, of too dear a purchase.UBALDO.Give me our court warfare; eh! Ricardo?The danger's not so great in the encounterOf a mistress—the conflict there costs no limbs—Thou, by thy own report, Ricardo,Wast a wag when young, and since that timeHast studied every rank, from the night traderI' th' street, with certain danger to thy pocket,To the gay high-flier in the cabinet.RICARDO.You talk, Ubaldo, as though you would appearA novice in love's mysteries; or perhapsMy better genius gives you cause for envy.UBALDO.No, thanks to my stars! I no man envyFrom my own want, or his abundance;To tell thee plainly, being, as you see,The likelier man, and of much more experience,There's no beautyBut yields ere it be summon'd; and as natureHas stamp'd me the monopolist of maidens,There's no man can buy till I have made my market.RICARDO.Ha, ha, ha!UBALDO.As I live I jest not. Why I'd partWith half my estate, nay, travel o'er the globeTo find that only Phoenix in my search,That could wing out of my sure shot.RICARDO.Who will dare doubt the dexterity of himThat twangs so long a bow? Pray, what d'ye thinkOf the Queen?UBALDO.No, no, Ricardo; I never yet did aimAt the lip-royal—that I still except:Yet were she not our Sov'reign's own soft dove,I would venture this neck to a halter,To write her in my am'rous catalogue.RICARDO.Have you but mark'd with what reserve she looksWhen the King himself makes his approach to her,As she were still a virgin, and his lifeBut one continued wooing?UBALDO.Yes, and how she oft has swoon'd when she has heardOf other women fam'd for charms or honors.RICARDO.I marvel that she does not banish henceAll other female virtue from her court.UBALDO.Well, where 'twill end I know not, for the KingIs so indulgent to her humours, that ev'n now,When both his crown and life are at the stake,He only studies her content—and whenShe's pleas'd to shew herself, music and masquesAre with all care and cost provided.RICARDO.This night she promis'd to appear.UBALDO.She did, and will, no doubt; for prithee markThe bustle of her royal harbinger.Enter LADISLAUS, EUBULUS, and Attendants, with perfumes.LADISLAUS.These rooms are not perfum'd as we directed.EUBULUS.No, Sir? I am sure the od'rous incenseCost treble the price of the whole week's provisionSpent in your royal houshold.LADISLAUS.How, Eubulus! when my HonoriaDescends to sanctify a place, and makeFor me a temple; say, were it not profaneTo deck it only with a careless hand?EUBULUS.Well; since you so closely hug your fetters,In love's name wear them; you are King, and thatConcludes you wise—for me, I do subscribe.LADISLAUS.Do, and looking up, behold this wonder!The Scene rising to soft music, discovers HONORIA in State, under a Canopy, attended by the Court.RICARDO.Wonder! it is more, great Sir!UBALDO.Rapture! enchantment!What think you? [To Eubulus.EUBULUS.As the King thinks: that is the surest guard,At least for you court butterflies—for me,I can see a handsome woman (an' she be so)Without spectacles,But yet to adoration look not on her;Heav'n, how he fawns!And with what assured gravity she takes it,As if it were his duty.Oh, she at last vouchafesHer hand; and, as if he had suck'd nectar from it,How he's exalted!—She's about to speak,What oracles shall we hear now?HONORIA.Since you are pleas'dWith such assurances of love and favourTo grace your handmaid, but in being yours, Sir,A matchless Queen;I'm bound in gratitude to deserveThe grace conferr'd upon me.LADISLAUS.You transcend in all things, Madam;And 'tis my glory to depose myselfFrom absolute command—surrendering upMy will and faculties to your disposure.And here I vow, not for a day or year,But my whole life,That whatsoever I in justice mayExact from these my subjects, you from meMay boldly challenge.—And, when you require it,
In sign of my subjection as your vassal,Thus will I pay my homage. [Kneels to her.HONORIA.O, forbear, Sir,Let not my lips envy my robe, on themPrint your allegiance often. I desireNo other tribute!LADISLAUS.Gracious Sov'reign,Boundless in bounty!EUBULUS.Is not here fine fooling? (Aside.)He's questionless bewitch'd!RICARDO.There's dainty pickingFor all that. (Aside.)EUBULUS.'Though my old life I forfeitFor it, yet I must speak. By your good leave, Sir;I have no suit to you, nor can you grant one,Having no power. You are like me, a subject,Her more than serene Majesty being present;And I must tell you, 'tis ill manners in you,Having depos'd yourself, to keep your hat on,And not stand bare, as we do. Gentlemen ushers,It does belong to you to see 't reform'd;He has given away his crown, and cannot challengeThe privilege of his bonnet. [Tauntingly.LADISLAUS.Do not tempt me.RICARDO.(Aside.) A devilish rough councellor this.UBALDO.The King seems all amazement!RICARDO.The Queen too has her shareOf deep imaginations. EubulusHath put both to't.UBALDO.Now she seems resolv'd.RICARDO.I long to know the issue.HONORIA.Give me leave,Dear Sir, to reprehend you for appearingPerplex'd, with what this privileg'd old manHath in his taunting irony applied.—You know it was your own delightTo sue to me with more humilityThan I desir'd, yet 'twas my duty to obey;I do but act the part you put upon me;And though you make me personate a Queen,And you my subject; when the play, your pleasure,Is at an end, I then am what I was,Still your humble wife, and you my King.RICARDO.Admirable, on my troth!HONORIA.(To Eubulus.) And now to your wise LordshipHath my KingCause to repent th' excess of favor to me,Which you dislike? speak! nay, boldly too;For I'm not ignorant what I can deserve,And may with justice challenge.EUBULUS.This I look'd for;After a seeming humble ebb, I knewA gushing tide would follow. (Aside.)HONORIA.By my birth,And liberal gifts of nature, as of fortune,From you, as what's beneath me, I expectWhat's due to Majesty, in which I amA sharer with your Sov'reign.EUBULUS.Good again.HONORIA.And as I am most eminent in place,In all my actions I would appear so.LADISLAUS.You need not fear a rival.HONORIA.I hope not.And 'till I find one, I disdain to knowWhat envy is.LADISLAUS.You are above it, Madam.HONORIA.For beauty without art, discourse, and freeFrom affectation, with what graces elseCan in the wife and daughter of a KingBe wish'd, I dare prefer myself.EUBULUS.Does the Court affordNo oil-tongu'd parasite, that you are forc'dTo be your own gross flatterer?LADISLAUS.Be dumbThou ceaseless spirit of contradiction,Or thy age, with all its boasted bluntness,Will not another hour protect thee. [A Trumpet.RICARDO.A courier, my Liege.LADISLAUS.Bid him enter.EUBULUS.Here's one, I fear, unwelcome as myself.Enter OFFICER.LADISLAUS.From the camp, Sir?OFFICER.Ay, my dread Liege, this from the general.[The King reads the letters.LADISLAUS.'Tis well, my Queen! the gallant FerdinandDoth here inform us, that by rapid marchHe hath so gain'd upon the Turkish lines,That ere the setting of the sun, the fateOf either Kingdom must be known. Let's in,And there, in Council, wait th' approaching tidings.[Exit King, &c.ACT II.SCENE I.Enter HILLARIO and CORISCA.HILLARIO.SO, you like my speech?CORISCA.If you give it good action, i' th' delivery.HILLARIO.If! oh, how I pity you!Why, I've play'd the fool before now.CORISCA.There I do agree with you.HILLARIO.Well, if I put not our mistress, the Lady Sophia,Out of her dumps with laughter, I look notFor preferment.CORISCA.Do, and thou shalt be the best of Hillarios;For she hath drank too oft the bitter cup,A pleasant one must now restore her;But think you she'll endure a jest about his death,Since for his absence only she so grieves?HILLARIO.Um! that is a question which a widowOnly can resolve, and therefore worth the trying.There be, who in their husband's sickness, have wept
Their pottle of tears a-day; but being assur'dAt midnight he was dead, i' th' morningDry'd up their handkerchiefs, and thought no more on't.CORISCA.Tush, she is none of that race: if her sorrowBe not true, woman ne'er wept in earnest.She has made herself a prisoner to her chamber,Dark as a dungeon, in which no beamOf comfort enters.HILLARIO.And yet there may be mischief doneIn a dark bed-chamber; nay, I've heardAs much.CORISCA.Pooh! she admits no visits;This hour she takes the air, with fondest hopeTo receive assurance from some that may pass byOf the success and safety of her Lord.Now if your device will take—HILLARIO.Ne'er fear it:I am provided cap-a-pee, havingI' th' summer-house my properties ready;A courier's habit, and his sounding horn,Found 'mongst our useless armoury.(SOPHIA speaks within.) Bring my veil there.CORISCA.Be gone, I hear her coming.HILLARIO.I vanish: but if I don't appear,And what's more, appear perfect, hoot at me.[Exit HILLARIO.Enter SOPHIA.SOPHIA.I was flatter'd once I was a star, but nowLike a prodigious meteor I appear,Hung in the air between my hopes and fears,And ev'ry hourThat yields a waning light to dying comfort,I do expect my fall, and certain ruin.In wretched things, more wretched is delay.Dreams and fantastic visions walk their roundAbout my widow'd bed, and ev'ry slumber'sBroke with loud alarms: Can these be thenBut sad presages, girl?CORISCA.You make 'em so,And antedate a loss shall ne'er befal you;Such pure affection, such mutual love,A house without contention; in two bodiesOne will and soul, like to the rod of concordKissing each other, cannot be short liv'd.SOPHIA.O, Corisca!Too well I know thy reasons like thy wishes,Are built upon a weak foundation,To raise me comfort: since my EugeniusEmbark'd himself upon a sea of dangerIn his dear care of me, I've naught but sorrow known;'Tis strange, methinks, no tidings yet have reach'd us!CORISCA.Ill news, Madam,Is swallow-wing'd, while good but creeps on crutches. [A horn sounds.SOPHIA.Ah! what's that?CORISCA.This should be a courier from the camp,As I take it. [Sounds again.SOPHIA.It maketh this way still, and nearer yet!The messenger appears, and in strange armour,Heav'n, if it be thy will!Enter HILLARIO disguised.HILLARIO.'Tis no boot to strive.My horse being tir'd, I'll walk me on foot;And that the castle, which is very nearTo give me entertainment, may soon hear me,I will another lusty blast! then drawing nigh,Ask for the Lady who's 'yclep'd Sophia.CORISCA.He names you, Madam!HILLARIO.for to her I do convey,Thus clad in arms, news of a gallant soul,By name Eugenius.SOPHIA.From my Lord? 'tis I,I am that brave Eugenius's wife;So may Mars favour you in all your battles,As you with speed unload me of the burdenI labour under, till I am confirm'd,Both where, and how you left him:Have you no letters from him?HILLARIO.No; all mere word of mouth:I' the camp we use no pens, but write with swords;Know he's in health, and what's more, full of glory:And now, I will proclaim his matchless deeds;But tremble not while I relate the wonder,Tho' I declare it in a voice of thunder!SOPHIA.This is some counterfeit braggard.CORISCA.Nay, hear him, Madam!HILLARIO.The rear march'd first, which follow'd by the van,And winged with the swift battalia,No man durst stay to shift his shirt,Or disencumber it of its hopeful stock;Yet e'er the armies join'd, that pickled elf,Thy dainty duckling, bold Eugenius,Advanc'd with gallant stride, like Hercules!A hundred thousand Turks (it is no vaunt)Assail'd him with their bashaws of nine tails;But how did he receive e'm? With his keen lanceHe did so cut and carbonade 'em, thatOne half fled;—but t' other wanting legsAnd arms, could neither fight, nor follow!SOPHIA.This is ridiculous.HILLARIO.I must take breath,Then, like a nightingale, I'll sing his death.CORISCA.His death?HILLARIO.On my troth I'm out, my wit forsakes me. (Aside)CORISCA.Recover, dunderhead! (Aside)HILLARIO.How he escap'd I should have sung, not died,For tho' a knight, when I said so, I fibb'd:Weary he was, and scarce could stand an end,When looking round for some courageous knightTo rescue him, as one perplex'd in woe,He call'd to me—help, help, Hillario!CORISCA.He has spoil'd all! (Aside)SOPHIA.Are you the man of arms? Then I'll make boldTo take off your martial beaver; you had fool's hairEnough without it—slave, how dar'st thou makeThy sport of what concerns me more than life,In such an antic fashion? Am I grown.Contemptible to those I feed?—You, Corisca,Had a hand in't too, as it appears.CORISCA.We did it only for your mirth, Madam.HILLARIO.For myself, I hopeI have spoke like a good soldier at least.SOPHIA.Hence, buffoon!I never but with reverence name my Lord,And shall I hear him by thy tongue profan'd?
But since you areTransform'd, and turn'd knight-errant, take your course,And wander where you please; for here I vow,By my Lord's life, an oath I will not break,Till his return, or certainty of his safety,My doors are shut against thee.[Exit SOPHIA.CORISCA.You have madeA fine piece of work on't! how do you like your reward?You had a foolish itch to be an actor,And may now stroll about where you please.HILLARIO.Will you buy my share o'th' profit, Corisca?CORISCA.No, I fear I have alreadyToo much of mine own—And so, dear Don Quixote, taking my leave,I leave you to your new fortune.[Exit CORISCA.HILLARIO.Have I cudgell'dMy poor brain for this rare invention,To be thus rewarded?—I could turnTragedian, and roar amain, but that I fear'Twould get me too large a stomach, havingNo meat to satisfy her cravings—Ah, poor me!I cannot beg in armour, that would dishonourMore than myself; and steal I dare not!—My end must be to stand in a corn field,And fright away the crows for bread and cheese,Or find some hollow tree in the highway,And there sell switches till my Lord's return![Exit HILLARIO.SCENE II.Enter EUBULUS, RICARDO, and UBALDO, with wands of Office.EUBULUS.I like the issue of this stubborn battle:Are the officers gone as by the King directed,To receive the gallant General?RICARDO.Long since, and ere this have greeted him.EUBULUS.You know your office, Lords, on his arrival?UBALDO.Who, we? oh! fear not us, my Lord, I pray,We know our distance and degrees.RICARDO.The state were miserable truly, ifThe court had none of her own breed familiarWith all the gaits of form and punctilio,To receive its visitors.UBALDO.'Tis a great pityThat such as sit at the helm, provide no betterFor the training up of the gentry:—in my judgmentAn academy erected, with large pensionsTo such as miraculously speakI'th' congees, cringes, postures, and the phraseProper to every nation.RICARDO.O, it wereAn admirable piece of work.UBALDO.And yet rich foolsThrow away their charity on hospitalsFor beggars and lame soldiers, and ne'er studyThe due regard to compliment, and court breeding.EUBULUS.Our court needs no aid this way, since it isA school of nothing else. There are some of youWhom I forbear to name, whose coining headsAre the mint of all new fashions, that have doneMore hurt to the kingdom by superflous foppery,Which the foolish gentry imitate, than a warOr a long famine; all the treasure byThis foul excess, is got into the hands ofSilk-men, tailors, and embroiderers!Nay, the third part of the land too, our noblesEngrossing titles only!UBALDO.My Lord, you are bitter.RICARDO.Sharp as a hoar-frost. [A trumpet.Enter a SERVANT.SERVANT.The general is alighted, and now enter'd.RICARDO.Were he ten generals, I am prepar'd,And know what I will do.UBALDO.Pr'ythee what, Ricardo?RICARDO.Why, I'll fight at compliments with him.UBALDO.Will you? then I'll charge him too, on the same gage.EUBULUS.Take care, gallants, you do not find thisA more desperate service than you think for.

Impatient of delay,With the flower of our prime gentlemen, I charg'dTheir main battalia, and with their assistance
Broke in; but when I was almost assur'dThey were routed, by a stratagemOf the subtle Turk,Rallying up his troops on either side,I found myself so far engag'd (for IMust not conceal my faults) that I knew notWhich way, with honor, to retreat.EUBULUS.I likeA general that tells his faults, and is notAmbitious to engross unto himselfAll honor, as some have; in which, with justice,They could not claim a share.FERDINAND.Being thus hemm'd in,Their scymetars rag'd amongst us; and my horseKill'd under me, I every minute look'd forAn honorable end, and that was allMy hope could fashion to me. Circled thusWith death and horror, as one sent from heav'n,This man of men, with some choice horse that follow'd [To Eugenius.His brave example, did pursue the trackHis sword cut for them; and (but that I see himAlready blush to hear what, he being present,I know would wish unspoken) I should say, Sir,By what he did, we boldly may believeAll that is writ of ancient heroes!EUGENIUS.General,Pray spare the feelings of an humble soldier.EUBUIUS.Do not blushTo hear a truth, here are a pair of Monsieurs, [To Ubaldo and Ricardo.

Horse and manShrunk under his strong arm: more with his looksFrighted, the valiant fled; with which encourag'd,My soldiers, like young eagles, preying underThe wings of their fierce dam, bravely came on.By him I was remounted, inspir'dWith treble courage, and such as fled beforeBoldly made head again; and to confirm 'em,It suddenly was apparent that the fortuneOf the day was ours. Each soldier and commanderPerform'd his part; but this was the great wheelBy which the lesser mov'd, and all rewardsAnd signs of honor to him alone belong.LADISLAUS.And they shallDeservedly fall on him.To the banquet now—prepare to entertain 'em.[The Masques retire repeating the Chorus.HONORIA.Permit me, Sir, to hopeThat your commanders,Especially this stranger, may as I.
In my discretion shall think good, receiveWhat's due to their deserts.LADISLAUS.What you determineShall know no alteration.EUBULUS.The soldierIs like to have good usage when he dependsUpon her pleasure.HONORIA.With you, Sir, [To Eugenius.I will begin; and as, in my esteem,You are most eminent, expect to haveWhat's fit for me to give, and you to take;Bring me my casket, and with speed:[ACANTHE goes out, and returns immediately with a Casket.See here!The lapidary's idol! gold is trash!A poor salary fit for grooms—wear theseAs studed stars within your circling shield;Call them Honoria's gift,Who loves not a valiant soldier; yet not to takeFrom the magnificence of the King, I willDispense his bounty too, but as a pageTo wait on mine: for other losses takeAn hundred thousand crowns: your hand, dear Sir,And this shall be thy warrant.

For your life, hazarded in the late action;And that we may follow her great exampleIn cherishing her love, ask what your heart can wish!EUGENIUS.If wealth were my ambition, by the QueenI am made rich already, to th' amazementOf all that see, or shall hereafter readThe story of her bounty.—If to spendThe remnant of my life in deeds of arms,No region is more fertile of good Knights,From whom my knowledge that way may be better'd,Than this your warlike Hungary:—but, alas! Sir,I am not my own, being by destiny,Which I cannot resist, forc'd to preferMy country's homely smoke, before the fireWith which your bounties warm me—All then I ask,Dread Sir, is but your gracious license forMy departure.LADISLAUS.Whither?EUGENIUS.To my own home, Sir; just on the frontier of your realm:My own poor home, which will, at my return,Grow rich by your munificence. I am hereBut a body without a soul; and till I find itIn the embraces of a constant wife,Whose beauteous excellencies know no rival,I am but half myself.HONORIA.And is she thenSo chaste and fair as you infer?Have I liv'd to hear this?

I begin toWaver in my faith, and make it doubtfulWhether the Saints, so canonized forTheir holiness of life, sinn'd not in secret,Since my Eugenius is fall'n from his virtueIn such an open fashion. Could it be elseThat such a husband, so devoted to me,So vow'd to temp'rance,—for unhallow'd giftsShould thus to wantons sacrifice his fame?Was't for this he left me?Was it not enough to cloath me with the shame,But he must make me wear their am'rous spoils!Here will I tear them off; and with my tears,Their poison wash away!—Yet hold! who knowsBut these are false and wanton knaves, whoTraduce his honor with the basest views.His long-try'd love a different tale relates,And bids me not too rashly censure him:At least these Lords with keener eye I'll read,Ere I impute to him so foul a deed![Ex.END OF ACT THE THIRD.ACT IV.SCENE I.Enter EUGENIUS.EUGENIUS.THIS is a desperate straight, there's no avoiding;I must compliance feign to allHer passion urges, or—or what? onlyThat with my life my miseries will end!But were the pointed axe uplifted now,My neck upon the block, I would not buyAn hour's reprieve, by such a faithless barter!Yet after all, Sophia may be false!The visit of these silken courtiersMuch alarms me, for they've been early train'dIn all the soft and wanton gallantriesThat shake the easy faith of yielding woman:I almost dread to ask for council here!

You may safer run uponThe mouth of a cannon when it's unloading!SOPHIA.I protest I do not understand you.UBALDO.I'll then expound it for your good; he isNought but a scurvy fish at best; the tub'sHis weekly bath; he hath not drank for yearsBut sasafras and guiacum; and dry mutton'sHis daily portion!SOPHIA.Bless me from him!UBALDO.'Tis a good pray'r, sweet Lady; forIf my tongue burn not when I name Ricardo,Gibbet me!SOPHIA.Your caution I'll reward.UBALDO.I do expect as much; sweet, all perfection,I think I've marr'd his market, come what may; [Aside.—But when?SOPHIA.Why, presently; follow my woman,She knows where to conduct you, and will serveYou for a page to-night.—Be it your careTo minister at his toilet, and that with speed; [To Corisca.Delay takes from delight; a nectar possetSee be quickly brought into his chamber!UBALDO.Excellent Lady!—and a caudle tooI'th' morning, if so it please you.CORISCA.I willProvide for you, my Lord, depend upon't.Enter UBALDO, and CORISCA.SOPHIA.How closely they pursue me! for here comesThe other beagle.Enter RICARDO.Take purse and all![Ricardo gives his purse to Hillario.HILLARIO.Would this good company but often come,I might make a pretty term on't—I doubtWhether the fare these dolts have this way bought,Will prove a gainful purchase.SOPHIA.For your sake,I've put him off; he only begg'd a kiss,And so we parted.RICARDO.He did not touch your lip?SOPHIA.Why sure there was no danger in the touch?RICARDO.No? Quickly eat these scented lozenges,Of forty crowns an ounce, or you're undone?SOPHIA.Wherefore? what can be th' virtue of 'em?RICARDO.I am compell'd to use 'em in abundance,E'en when I talk with him, or else be poisoned:But I'll be free with you—he was once a creature,It may be of Heaven's making, but long sinceHe is turn'd to a druggist's shop: the Spring and FallHold all the year with him: that he lives, he owesTo Art, not Nature; she has giv'n him o'er;He moves like the fairy king, on screws and wheelsMade by his doctor's recipe, and yet stillThey're out of joint, and each day want repairing:—In a frosty morning,You may thrust him in a pottle pot; his bonesRattle in his skin like beans toss'd in a bladder;If he but hear a coach, fumigation cannot save him
From the chin evil. In a word, he isNot one disease, but all; but being my friend,I would forbear his character, as I would notWrong him in your good opinion.SOPHIA.The virtues you bestow on him, to meAre mysteries I know not—however,Since my partiality for you in vainI would conceal—this sigh declares me your's.RICARDO.Poor—blind Ubaldo! He must take the maid.SOPHIA.Hillario!—be it your immediate careTo uncloath the gentleman, and quicklySee that you robe him in the sattin vest,And lay the perfum'd night-cap on his pillow.RICARDO.Good: and for thy true and trusty service,This cloak, this sword, and doublet, all are thine,When I the anti-chamber quit.—HILLARIO.I takeYour word, sweet Sir.RICARDO.Dear Lady, stay not long.SOPHIA.Expect me soon.HILLARIO.This is the way, sweet Sir.[Exeunt HILLARIO and RICARDO.SOPHIA.I was much to blame to credit their reportsTouching my Lord! who so traduce each other,

Ha!My cloaths are ta'en away too! must I starve?Is this my lodging?

'tis either a pig-stye, or a prison!The windows are double barr'd with iron;And if I could leap down, my neck were snapt.I am betray'd! Rogues!

[Looks thro' the window.Who makes that noise there? help, if you be man.RICARDO.I know not if I'm man or no!—Besides,I'm where I cannot help myself, and yetI fain would see your visage—Ubaldo!Oh! then thou hast chous'd thy friend, and fortune's smilesUpon thee; thou'st brib'd that wanton lacqueyTo throw me thus in durance vile; while thouHath stolen into the perfum'd robes, and gain'dThe costly vestments she design'd for me.UBALDO.Yes, truly, and in their bounty somewhat more!RICARDO.An upper blanket, which thou well can'st spare,Kick'd from thy wanton chamber, would befriendMe much in this extremity.UBALDO.A what Ricardo?—thou art mad!RICARDO.Why, hast thou notMy scented night cap, and my sattin vest?UBALDO.Who, I? Bare as a winter robin-red-breastHave they stript me! Prithee throw meThy cloak to cover me, for I m almostFrozen to death.RICARDO.My cloak! I've none left:I'm strip't as bare as thou; and in returnThey've given me, I see, the fool's cast suit.UBALDO.O then we're both undone! lend me thy hand, and roarA little with me for some friendly succour.

Bring here a distaff;Tho' no Omphale, or I do mistake it,Nor you a second Hercules: fetch it.

[To EUG.HONORIA.Reflect, that you were once deceiv'd in me.EUGENIUS.Hath she not all confess'd, and vilely fledTo fetch her pamper'd paramours,Deck'd out in triumph o'er my soul disgrace?See where they come! but this shall—[EUGENIUS draws his sword; but starts back on the nearer approach of SOPHIA, who leads down UBALDO, and RICARDO, attended by HILLARIO and CORISCA.How's this! more mysteries in store?EUBULUS.What have we here!SOPHIA.You must come on and shew yourselves.UBALDO.The King.RICARDO.And Queen too!LADISLAUS.I rememberThis face, when it was in a better plight:Are not you Ricardo?RICARDO.I was once so, pleaseYour Grace.HONORIA.And this thing, I take itWas once Ubaldo!UBALDO.I am now I know not what.RICARDO.We thank your Majesty for employing usTo this subtle Circe!SOPHIA.You see, Madam,How I have cur'd your servants; and what favorsThey with their gallantry have won from me!You may, as they are physic'd, I presume,Now safely trust them; they have learnt, besides,Their several trades to live by, and paid nothingBut cold and hunger for them, and may nowSet up for themselves; for here I give them over.UBALDO.Then hang all trades!I'll find a new one; that is, to live honest.[Exeunt Ubaldo and Ricardo.HILLARIO.I am sorry for this general gaol delivery;These are my fees, however, so I'm content.[Exit, strutting in his fine cloaths.SOPHIA.As for you, Sir!— [To Eugenius.EUGENIUS.Which way shall I intreat you?I am not worthy of it; my Sophia!My best Sophia! here, before the King,The Queen, these Lords, and all surrounding us,
I do renounce my error, and embrace youAs the great example to all after times,With reverence to imitate.SOPHIA.Not so, Sir!I still hold off, although I here have clear'dMy doubtful innocence.When you went to the wars,I set no spy upon you, to observeWhich way you wander'd, though our sex, by nature,Is subject to suspicions; for I fix'dMy confidence on your try'd loyalty:But to deal as you did, 'gainst your reason,With magic nonsense to survey my actions,Was more than woman's weakness: therefore know,And 'tis my boon unto the King, I doDesire a separation from your bed;For I will spend the remnant of my lifeIn pray'r, and meditation!EUGENIUS.O take pityUpon my weak condition, or I amMore wretched in your innocence, than ifI had found you guilty. Have you shewn a jewelOut of the cabinet of your rich mindTo lock it up again?—She turns away—Will none speak for me?
