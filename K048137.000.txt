he can't oblige you, as he has not more than will just enable him to take the box at Brookes's to-night.Exit.Edw.Well, well—a verbal answer to my letter; his good manners he levels to his sincerity—my friend too.SONG.If balmy friendship yet survives,Ah, whither is she fled;Believe the tongues of men, she lives,Their actions speak her dead:Perhaps responsive echo's shade,She haunts this brittle mound,Or flitting Sylph, or watry Naide,In fancy only found.The gilded cards to feast and ball,The silken guest invite;They fondly think 'tis friendship's call,But pride and pomp indite:For int'rest with delusive wiles,Beneath fair friendship's form;In sunshine on us sweetly smiles,But leaves us in the storm.Enter Caroline.Caro.My dear, dear, Edward!Edw.My sweet Caroline.Caro.Such a delicious scheme as I have devised for our relief—Come, come, I'll have no more melancholy.Edw.For myself I shou'd not care; if single, I cou'd elbow my way thro' the bustle of this busy world; but to involve you, my love, a partner in my poverty—Caro.Poor pretty bird! then it cou'd soaring cleave the air and sweetly chirp the song of freedom, if not impeded by its troublesome, yet affectionate male.SONG.While pert cock sparrows sport and playBy turns with ev'ry female gay,The turtle faithful to his doveLives but for her, and lives to love,Still closely nes;tling side by sideSit the good bridegroom, and good bride,And murm'ring, gurgling on the sprayBoth bill and coo their hours away.But Edward, is the carriage gone?Edw.Sold by auction.Caro.You are so hasty—but no matter—if my plot don't lift us into another, welcome a calash and pattens—let us first methodically state out case to fortune, and invoke her aid.Edw.Begin then.Caro.My wealthy uncle, Sir Walter Weathercock —Edw.Wou'd have married my rich aunt, Miss Hebe Wintertop.Caro.A quarrel on the bridal morn, broke off the match.Edw.Hate succeeds to love.Caro.Or rather anger to dotage.Edw.At this period, I possessing an ardent passion for Caroline—Caro.And I, having no aversion for Edward—Edw.Are forbid by the old ones to hold further intercourse with each other, on pain of their immortal displeasure, but nobly sacrificing interest to love, you ran away with me.Caro.O fie, Edward! it was you ran away with me.Edw.Married scarce a twelve month, our mutual partiality for good house-keeping has brought our stock to the last guinea—and no living without money.Caro.Then let us die.Edw.Die!Caro.Yes,—my life to yours, it enables us to live comfortably hereafter.Edw.Ha, ha, ha! pleasant enough this! but Caroline, I confess I can't comprehend how dying can conduce to a person's living comfortably—Ha, ha, ha!Caro.You laugh, but I am serious.Edw.Death is indeed a serious subject—but come, your scheme.Caro.It lies thus—you shall instantly go to your aunt, in all the suppos'd grief of a disconsolate widower, tell her that I died this morning: I'll to my uncle, and tell him the same story of you—Now, each supposing the cause of their displeasure for ever remov'd, will,(I make no doubt) restore us again into favour, supply us with an ample sum for the present, and settle on each an affluent appointment in future.Edw.But the discovery of such a fraud—Caro.How—they never see each other, perhaps never may—then their circle is so remote from ours—or, at worst, can we be poorer, or farther remov'd from, their favour than at present.Edw.Say no more, I am dead.Caro.And I, gone with the doleful news to my uncle—I fear nothing but a laugh to prevent my success.Edw.And that we do succeed, dear fortune grant.DUETTO.Edw.Let me but my Caroline guard,My love from distress let me save;And I ask for no other rewardOr blessing on this side the grave.Caro.Let me but see Edward content,His lot while his Caroline shares:Tho' uncle shou'd never relent,Or aunt shou'd be angry, who cares.Both.Deign fortune to smile on a pair,Who've trusted so long to thy pow'r;Thy woes since they patiently bear,O grant them some sweet with the sour.Exeunt.A Room in Sir Walter Weathercock's House.Enter Motley, peeping about.If Sir Walter shou'd see me now—what then—I'll tell him, says I,—if wrinkled bachelors keep smooth cheek'd house-keepers, "as Squire Ranger says," we clever young fellows have a right—I'd tell him—if he had not a cane in his hand—cane or no cane, I'd—Here he is—I had as good hide myself. (Retires.) Eh, no, its my sweet Comfit.Enter Comfit.Com.Now who cou'd imagine that a simple country girl as I was five years ago, cou'd turn out such a—I'm very ugly to be sure.Looking in a glass.SONG.When I left Primrose Green, and first came up to town,Just at blooming fifteen in my plain linen gown;Tho' my thoughts were all gay and my head full of play,Let me die, if—Oh fie! was not all I cou'd say.But now improv'd in ev'ry grace,With charms to captivate a King;And seen in shape, or air of face,My tout ensemble is the thing.What can become of this wretch, Motley?Mot.That's I.(Aside.)Com.I know the fellow loves me.Mot.Do I?(Aside.)Com.He'd leap at marrying me.Mot.I'd look twice first.(Aside.)Com.I'm certainly a handsome girl.Looking in the glass.Mot.Yes, and you don't know it.(Aside)Com.But these men—Motley's perhaps at this moment, list'ning to some conceited hussey of other.Mot.I am indeed.(Aside.)Com.I'm sorry Motley's so poor.Mot.Upon my soul, so am I.(Aside.)Com.But my three hundred pound—Mot.Say no more, I'll have it.Com.Ah, Motley, you devil, how cou'd you frighten a body so?Mot.Take me! for as Jacques, the huntsman, says—"Motley's your only man."Com.Who says so?Mot.Jacques, in the play of "How d'ye like it."—There, where Harlequin Touchstone is—"Motley," says he, "is your only man," and he did not know me from Adam, only it came so apropos.Com.Motley, you improv'd during the year you liv'd with the actress.Mot.Yes, I think I did a little.Com.But how came she to part with you?Mot.Because I was a Pagan.Com.A Pagan!Mot.Yes—you must know she gave me a shilling one night to go to the twelve-penny gallery, and order'd me, after she sung a song, to cry out ongiorum.Com.What's ongiorum?Mot.Ongiorum is Latin for, don't sing any more. Well, up I mounted—but unfortunately taking a glass too much with a friend I met in the gallery—instead of my mistress, when one Mr.Damon, who play'd, the Devil that night, had sung his, song, I roar'd out—oncorum, oncorum, Red Stockings—so my mistress turn'd me off next morning; for, says she, (looking in the glass, after your fashion just now) none but a Pagan, cou'd mistake a Devil for an Angel.Com.Poor Motley!—Pray, what sort of people are there players?Mot.What sort!—Lord, my dear Comfit, of all sorts.SONG.An actor's a comical dog,Now frisky, now dull as a log;So changeable all, now short and now tall,Now plump, them slim as a frog.Now Paddy the brogue he puts on,Then struts with the pride of a Don;Now a French oui Monsieur, then a Dutch ya Mynheer,Or braw Donald the head of his clan.How rarely they take in the town,From one shilling up to a crown!They pant, and they cry, fight, tumble and die,But laugh when the curtain is down.Com.That's a good song—but I wish you were down stairs, for my master makes this his way to the study, and his aversion to your mistress is such—I think I hear him—if he sees you I am ruin'd.Mot.He can't remember me.Com.Hush, he's here—don't speak, and I'll get you off.Enter Sir Walter Weathercock.Sir Wal.Comfit, I wanted to ask—who's that?Com.The lad, Sir, belongs to Mr. Quack, the famous rheumatism man, at advertises to supply elderly gentlemen with calves.Sir Wal.Calves! his master's a grazier,—ha!Com.No, Sir, a gouty doctor.Sir Wal.Oh! the doctor has the gout?Com.No, no, Sir, he cures the rheumatism, gout, and dropsy.Sir Wal.Have you a dropsy? eh Comfit!Com.No, Sir, but the doctor gives this young man leave to turn a penny for himself in the fortune telling-way.Sir Wal.A fortune-teller!—I'll take a peep thro' his telescope of futurity—Pray friend—Motley makes signs and faces.Sir Wal.Why does he make faces at me? can't he speak?Com.He can't speak, Sir, for many reasons—first he's dumb—secondly—Sir Wal.Hold—your first reason is sufficient for his not speaking—shall I ever marry?Motley grimaces and makes signs.Sir Wal.What's that?Com.He means yes, Sir.Sir Wal.He lies!—if so, shall I be happy?—Eh!Motley points upwards with his finger.Com.He means Sir, that matrimony will send you to Heaven.Sir Wal.How?Motley makes horns with his fingers.Sir Wal.Thro' Cuckold's-gate, Sir Walter Weathercock call'd cuckold, by a mumming magician! a secondhand son of a sorcerer! a hey-cockolorum conjuror! a wizard with a pig-tail! How long have you been dumb, sirrah?Mot.Sir, I was born dumb—Zounds!Aside.Sir Wal.In my life I never heard a dumb man speak so plain.Com.Such a blockhead!Aside.Sir Wal.Cures dropsies! raises dropsies I fancy, eh, Comfit!—the doctor provides rams as well as calves—this is a ram of Jacob's breed—parti-colour'd, streak'd and pied.Com.Own yourself. [Apart to Motley] The truth is, Sir, this is Miss Wintertop's man, and he's come to—tell my master what you are come about.Mot.Yes, Sir, I come to—what the devil did I come about; [Apart to Comfit] I come, Sir—I come, Sir—I'm come, Sir.Sir Wal.I see you are come Sir, but what brought you, Sir?Com.With his lady's compliments for the honor of your company this evening—I know he won't go.Aside.Sir Wal.And pray, hussy, have you no butt but your master for your hums and haws.Com.Sir, I beg your pardon, but I knew your spirit wou'd reject with scorn an offer from Miss Wintertop, and so, Sir, to save the poor lad from the dreadful effects of your fury, I thought to have got him out of the house without your knowledge.Sir Wal.I believe I ought to be angry here [Aside]—Yes, Comfit, I am in a fury! go back to your Mistress, sirrah, and if I catch you here again, I'll bamboo you so, that it shall puzzle Hunter, that able anatomist, to distinguish one muscle from another! I will upon my honor, you rascal.Mot.Oncorum, red stockings again, by gad—I'll mollify him to some tune out of the Beggar's Opera.Aside.SONG.Oh ponder well, be not severe,Nor beat me like a drum;A stick that makes that speak I fear,Would make poor Motley dumb.Exeunt Motley and Comfit.Enter Servant.Serv.Mrs. Sandford, is below Sir, and insists on coming up.Sir Wal.What, my niece! I won't see her—I'll, never see her, tell her so.Ser.She's here, Sir.Exit.Enter Caroline.Sir Wal.So niece, I find you will add another twig to the rod of disobedience, by thus intruding contrary to my express commands.Caro.Ah, Sir! your rigour would dissolve to pity and forgiveness, did you know my calamitous situation.Sir Wal.Pity! your tears play'd off at rny heart, are are Spanish onions against the rock of Gibraltar—you wou'd marry Miss Wintertop's nephew; tho' you knew how injuriously I was us'd by that old coxcom his aunt. You have a husband, and so—make much of him.Caro.Alas, Sir! I have no husband.Sir Wal.I said he wou'd run away from you, when you became poor.Caro.Ah, Sir, wrong not the memory of the—Oh, wretched Caroline! Alas, Sir, my husband's dead.Sir Wal.Edward dead!—gad so niece, I ask your pardon—I'm sorry—I am faith—poor thing—Eh! gad!—now Edward is gone, I begin to think he was a worthey lad—now he's gone, I—Caro.For ever—ever gone!Sir Wal.Well, we m'ust only take care of those that stay behind,—we must have a handsome funeral,—but I'll go see the body.Caro.Heaven forbid! [Aside.] Do, dear Sir, I left his sorrowful aunt weeping over him.Sir Wal.Oh, if she's there, I'll stay here—Caroline, no money left I soppose—Ay, Edward a Bon Vivant! liv'd all the days of his life. [Gives her a note.] Well, there's five hundred pounds—have a decent funeral, Sand kiss tne child—come dry up your tears, and look upon ma again as your parent.Caro.Sir, this goodness—Sir Wal.Come, child, you are a young widow, don't let your tears impair your beauty.Caro.Oh, Sir, think on what I have lost.SONG.See the blossom of Spring that enriches the thorn,Unfolding its sweetness to welcome the mam;But if nipt, the fond birds in soft elegy mourn,That fragrance and beauty that ne'er shall return.Can the sun beams of hope glance a ray of relief,No, let tears overflow the dew drops of grief,Soon the bold hand of Winter shall cover the head,Soon alas! must I wither since Edward is dead.Exit.Sir Wal.And Edward's dead! it must be for my kind condolence that his aunt sent for me; I'm sorry I

treated her message with such contempt—Heigh ho! I feel my love for her revive. I'll wait on her at her own house, 'tho' the sight of Edward has made her so sad—Ay, no making love when a dead man's in company.Exit.A Chamber at Miss Wintertop's.Enter Edward and a Servant.Edw.Only a gentleman wou'd speak with Miss Wintertop. Exit Servant. If my success with my aunt here equals Caroline's expectations—Oh, here she is.Enter Miss Wintertop and Servant.Miss Win.Your most obedient—my nephew! how dare you Richard, call me to any person with previously bringing up their name.Exit Servant.Edw.I fear'd a knowledge of mine, madam, might deprive me of the honour, which I now enjoy; but did you know the fatal disaster that occasioned—Miss Win.I don't love disasters, and I now tell, once for all, nephew, your disasters shall never be the less for me; your disobedient marriage with Sir Walter's niece, has—Edw.Ah! Madam, that marriage is eternally dissolv'd.Miss Win.Elop'd! I thought she'd turn out as fashionable a wife as e'er a Duchess of 'em all! but indeed what can e expected when ladies wear uniforms, and pay morning visits with phaetons and ponies—gone off! fine doings.Edw.My Caroline, Madam, was compell'd to yield; the careful parent, and the tender husband, daily, with tears behold the wife and maiden ravish'd from their arms by that insatiate monster! that general Gallant.Miss Win.He rude to maidens too! the filthy fellow—what street does he live in?Edw.Who, Madam?Miss Win.General Gallant.Edw.My grief, too copious for common language swell'd into a metaphor; the gallant I mean, madam, was death.Miss Win.Death! well I never knew you to bring a pleasant story.Edw.Oh!Miss Win.What does the man mean by his blubbering and bellowing?Edw.Excuse my tears—but my Caroline is no more.Miss Win.Caroline dead—Oh, that's another thing! well nephew, tho' your match was repugnant to my will, I don't rejoice at your wife's death.Edw.That's very good of you, madam.Miss Win.But how, and when, pray, did this affair happen?Edw.This morning, suddenly! I hope the necessity of seeing you will excuse the indecorum of my being seen abroad so soon.Miss Win.Necessity! no money left I suppose—well, I find this accident has somewhat relax'd my severity. Pray, do you ever see that civil gentleman her uncle? I fancy your extravagance has render'd you the object of his bounty, but a nephew of mine, never shall be oblig'd to him—I'll send you some money—come, child, you must not give way to grief.Edw.O madam! had I never known the amiable qualities of Caroline, I shou'd not have such cause to lament her loss.Exit.Miss Win.Sir Walter's attention to Edward and Caroline has given a gentle puff to the dying embers of my love, and if—Enter Servant.Serv.Sir Walter Weathercock, madam.Miss Win.Oh, he has surpriz'd me at a most dismal criterion—admit him—Edward's tale has depress'd my spirits in the abyss of a lethargic torpitude. [Enter Sir Walter Weathercock.] Sir, this is an honour.Sir Wal.Madam,—I see she's in great grief for the death of her nephew.Aside.Miss Win.His niece's death affects him extremely.Sir Wal.Oh, Hebe! Hebe! my lovely old darling!Miss Win.Old darling! as rude as ever.Sir Wal.You are sorrowful—I don't wonder at it—well—accept my sincere condolence.Miss Win.Yes, you must feel for the death of so dear a relation—has it alter'd Caroline much? how does she look?Sir Wal.Dismal enough.Miss Win.Yes, death wears a dismal aspect.Sir Wal.You've seen Edward.Miss Win.Just now.Sir Wal.Lost his fine complexion I suppose.Miss Win.No, I think he looks as well as ever.Sir Wal.Ay, sudden death, I fancy, does not change the countenance much.Miss Win.Your niece was very young.Sir Wal.She's rising twenty—Edward, I fancy, was not above twenty-three.Miss Win.He'll be twenty-four his next birth-day.Sir Wal.Birth-day to a dead man. [Aside.] And poor Edward's gone!Miss Win.Yes, he's gone home—I wish you'd follow him, Sir Walter.Sir Wal.I am oblig'd to you, madam, but I hope I shan't go to his home these thirty years.Miss Win.Now that's unkind, the sight of a friend in the hour of trouble is such a comfort.Sir Wal.A great comfort indeed. [Aside.] I fancy you'll have a visit from Caroline when its dusk.Miss Win.Heaven forbid—no, when people quit this world, I beg to be excus'd from any further intercourse.Sir Wal.Why, madam, tho' my niece may be said to be out of this world now, yet the funeral vow, and a

few Lethean tears shed, I warrant her youth attracts the butterflies.Miss Win.Butterflies! the worms I think you mean, Sir Walter.Sir Wal.Worms! why to be sure divested of their gaudy outside, the macaronies are a species of grubs—but come, my angelic Hebe! let us forget our silly quarrels—here let me take this vernal sprig, as earnest of the sole possession of thee, thou aromatic shrub of winter savory.Taking her hand.Miss Win.Oh, you amorous Philander!Sir Wal.Oh, extasy! Hebe, get your nephew buried, and then we'll be married in—Miss Win.Wait till my nephew is buried?Sir Wal.Nay, I only speak for decency sake.Miss Win,How, Sir? wou'd you infer that I wou'd deviate from the rules of decency? I shou'd imagine when your niece is buried; the wedding—Sir Wal.My niece buried! why she's crack'd. [Aside.] Bury your nephew, madam.Miss Win.Bury my nephew?Sir Wal.To be sure! wou'd you hang him up between two loadstones like Mahomet of Mecca.Miss Win.Bury my nephew! why he's mad.Sir Wal.You know your nephew is dead.Miss Win.No, but you know your niece is dead.Sir Wal.Not I.Miss Win.Did not you say your niece had left this world?Sir Wal.Did not you say your nephew was gone to his long home.Miss Win.I tell you Edward left this room as you enter'd it.Sir Wal.I tell you, I saw Caroline at my house just now.Miss Win.Sir, I don't think it safe to stay in a place with you.Sir Wal.Madam, I shou'dn't have troubled your place, if you had not sent for me.Miss Win.I send for you, Sir!Sir Wal.Deny that too—here comes the very fellow who brought the message.Miss Win.Astonishing!Enter Motley.Mot.Madam, the—Ha, he here! damnation! this is the second time to day he cross'd the way.Miss Win.Pray Motley did I send you to Sir Walter Weathercock's this morning?Mot.Nothing but a lye can save me.Aside.Sir Wal.Speak, friend, did not I see you at my house to-day?Mot.Me! Oh Lord, Sir! not me, indeed.Sir Wal.Oh you infernal son of a—do you forget you were dumb.Mot.Dumb!

I will laugh—Ha, ha, ha! Hebe—you must grant me two trifles, forgive them, and marry me.Miss Win.Lord, Sir Walter!Sir Wal.You must, you shall, and first your virgin hand—as to the young folks, the fault was partly ours, to suffer our whimsical caprices to abandon them to poverty; I'd never let a child want money, for necessity often obliges a person to do that, which otherwise he'd blush to think of.Miss Win.It was a knavish affair—but I forgive you—and Sir Walter, I am yours for ever.FINALE.Sir Wal.Away with care, adieu to despair,'Tis the season to marry not bury,In love let's join, I'm Hebe's, she's mine;And all are alive and merry.Miss Win.When a lover so brisk, gives the spirits a frisk,Even maids must sing, hey down derry;Then to church let us go for I cannot say no,Where all are alive and merry.Edw.Late, my Caroline dear, be thou laid on the bier,May those lips long keep red as cherry;May both uncle and aunt prove a flourishing plant,And all keep alive and merry.Caro.Now both uncle and aunt are like us grown gallant,'Tis too soon to pass Charon's ferry;So my Edward and I, gladly join in the cry,While all are alive and merry.Mot.An adventure so gay, is as good as a play,Or a cup of canary or sherry;And if Comfit wou'd join, and say Motley I'm thine.We shou'd all be alive and merry.Com.When you offer your love, right and true let it prove,For champagne do not fool me with perry,Then if those who are here, contented appear,We shall all be alive and merry.FINIS.
