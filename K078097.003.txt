THE ATHENAID, A POEM.VOL. III.THE ATHENAID, A POEM,BY THE AUTHOR OF LEONIDAS.VOL. III.LONDON: PRINTED FOR T. CADELL, IN THE STRAND. M.DCC.LXXXVII.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the TWENTY-FIRST.SEV'N days were past, when Lamachus appear'dBefore Mardonius. Mighty chief, he said,I hasted to Themistocles, and spokeThy friendly words. His answer first imply'dNo more, than cold acceptance of the termsFor Mindarus. At length two hundred, prime,Of all his num'rous captives, he releas'd;His minister, Sicinus, in the ship,Which landed me, detains them near the port,
Till Haliartus, and the promis'd goldAre lodg'd on board. Themistocles himselfWas bound to Athens with his menial train,His wife and race. We parted on the shore.To me, repeating in a whisper'd toneThy proffers large, he scornful thus reply'd:"The spoils of Asia will exceed her gifts."Then loud thy brave defiance I pronounc'd.He with redoubled arrogance thus brief:"Rouse thy new master; else the plains of Thebes"I may attain before him." Fir'd with rageMardonious here: If Athens do not sendBy Alexander's mouth submission low,She shall become the spoil of Asian flames,Themistocles spectator of the blaze.Be swift; yon Greek for Mindarus exchange;Two hundred talents promis'd shall be paid;These ransom'd warriors I appoint my guard;Brave Mindarus their captain. Stern he ends;
In open fight th' Athenian to confrontMagnanimous he burns; his heated soulYields to delusion of that subtle chief,Wise like the serpent gliding through a brake,When his empoison'd jaws in silence stealOn some incautious woodman, who, on toilIntent, exerts his brawny strength, nor deemsA foe is nigh, nor hears him, nor perceives,Till sore the death-inflicting wound he feels.A summons swift for embarkation fliesTo Haliartus. With regret he leavesDear friends, but dearer his Acanthè's love,More prevalent his constant zeal for GreeceCombine to sooth his pain. They wing his speedTo good Sicinus, who, the ransom'd trainDischarging, tow'rds Euboea steers the keelWith Persian treasure fraught. The ev'ning clos'd,When by a hasty mandate to the son
Of Gobryas, Lamachus was call'd. The chiefIn perturbation of indignant wrathWas striding o'er the carpet, which bespreadHis rich pavilion's floor. His words were these:The Macedonian king is just arriv'dFrom Athens; I have seen him. Dost thou know,That supercilious populace hath spurn'dMy condescension, menac'd ev'n a prince,Their host, for proff'ring kindness in my name.Such my reward. To all th' Ionian Greeks,The seed of Athens, I, when victor, leftTheir democratic rule and laws unchang'd;But I will cut all freedom by the rootsFrom man's ungrateful race. The wily GreekInsinuating fram'd this brief reply:Perhaps the name of Xerxes may offendTh' Athenian tribes. Might Europe once behold
The son of Gobryas thron'd, then... Ha! proceed,Mardonius answer'd. Lamachus again:Doth not all Aegypt, doth not Libya's clime,With Asia vast, afford redundant swayTo gratify one monarch? First of men,Why may not Thrace, with Macedonia's realm,Thessalia, Greece, whate'er thy mighty armShall rend by conquest from the western world,Become thy prize? They willing might acceptA sov'reign like Mardonius. Try their choice.Away—Mardonius spake; and frowning badeThe Greek retire. Now left alone he mus'd,Thus questioning his heart: Aspiring thoughts,Do ye awaken at the coz'ning touchOf this vile tempter? Honour, while my earDetests th' adviser, fortify my breastAgainst th' advice—Enough—More swiftly drive,
Dull night, thy sooty wheels; come, active morn,Then to the field, Mardonius. Conquer now;Deliberate hereafter on the spoil.But thou may'st perish—perish, and the giftsOf fortune change to everlasting fame.A sudden trumpet strikes his ear; he seesMasistius nigh. So breaks the polar starThrough night's unrav'ling canopy of cloudsOn some bewilder'd sailor to correctHis erring course. Amidst a warm embraceBegan Mardonius: O, in season come,Thou more, than half myself! my strength decays,My talents languish, ev'n my honour sleeps,When thou art far. Masistius calm replies:I have compos'd Pallene's late revoltThrough all the district; Potidaea's wallsAlone resisted; from whose small domain
O'erflow'd by tides the army I withdrew.I come, Mardonius, not to hear a taleOf languid talents, or of strength decay'd,Much less of honour sleeping in thy breast,When I am absent. Honour on a rockImmoveable is fix'd; its solid baseThe billowy passions beat in vain, nor gustsOf fortune shake; support from none it wants,Firm in itself. Some augury, or dreamInexplicably dark, o'erclouds thy mind;Resume thy native manliness, O chief,Whose loyal faith the mightiest king entrustsWith all his pow'r and splendour, save the crown.Prepare to pass Thermopylae, and bringOur labours to decision. Gobryas' sonCompares the language of his spotless friendWith his own devious thoughts, and turns asideIn blushing silence; but, recover'd, sendsHis mandate forth to march by rising dawn.Not with a less commotion in his soulFrom diff'rent cares Emathia's prince resortsTo Amarantha. On her beauteous neckIn conjugal affection, yet in griefUnutterable long he hangs. Alas!My lord, she said, though early I presag'dThy embassy abortive, hath it prov'dDisastrous? Yes, her agonizing spouseReturn'd; what more disastrous, than reproachAmong the old, hereditary friendsOf my forefathers! Amarantha, lendAttention; amply shall my tongue relateEvents impress'd too deeply on my heart.I went to Athens; Aristides call'dHer various tribes; the image of a godWas he presiding. Innocent, at leastIntentionally guiltless, I began;Good will to Athens prompted ev'ry word:Impow'r'd by Xerxes, thus Mardonius greetsYou, men of Athens. Repossess your soil,Enlarg'd dominion from the royal handAsk and obtain; be govern'd by your laws;The son of Gobryas will rebuild your fanes;Accept the king's alliance, and be freeWith added strength and splendour. Me receive,Illustrious people, offspring of the soilWhich you inhabit. Not a guest unknownIn Athens, I, your Macedonian host,Of warm, unchang'd affection to your state,Salvation bring, prosperity, and peace.Reflect, what numbers of subjected Greeks,Some ancient foes to Athens, others friends,But now constrain'd, with Xerxes are ally'd.The small remainder unsubdu'd consultTheir own defence. Are Spartans in the field?Your produce, indefatigable race,Your new-built mansions to a second waste
Of flames, your wives, your progeny, they leaveTo want and rapine. Singly can you faceHalf Greece, all Asia, leagu'd against your weal?Oh! Amarantha, frowns on ev'ry browIndignant lowr'd around me. Present thereWas Aëmnestus from Laconia's state;He, who, unaw'd by Xerxes on his throne,Strange retribution claim'd, and sternly choseMardonius' self the victim to appeaseLeonidas. Th' Athenians he address'd:"Invading Sardis to enlarge your sway,"Athenians, you are authors of a war,"Which now extends to all of Grecian blood;"Ill would it then become you to desert"The gen'ral cause. To servitude resign'd"By you, a double shame the Greeks would castOn Athens, known of old and often prov'd
"By arms and counsel to redeem and guard"The liberty of nations. I condemn"Like you my tardy countrymen; will bleed"Not less for you, than Sparta. Soon, I trust,"She will arrange her phalanx on the field;"Else to your vengeance I devote my head."Meantime your wives and offspring ev'ry state"In love will cherish. Attic ears, be shut"To this deceiver; his condition calls"On him to plead for tyranny; himself"Wields a despotic scepter, petty lord"Of feeble Macedon, and Persia's slave."Severe and awful Aristides rose;His manners still urbanity adorn'd:"Ambassador of Sparta," he began,"Us thou hast charg'd as authors of the war,"Yet dost extol our vigour in redress
"Of injur'd states. Th' Ionians were enslav'd,"Our own descendants; Sardis we assail'd"To set them free; nor less our present zeal"For all of Grecian blood, by common ties"Of language, manners, customs, rites and laws"To us ally'd. Can Sparta doubt our faith?"What disingenuous, unbeseeming thought"In her, late witness of our lib'ral proof"Of constancy! when ev'ry clime on earth"Was equal to Athenians, where to chuse"Their habitation, true to Greece they stay'd"In sight of Athens burning to attempt"The dang'rous fight, which Spartans would have "shunn'd."Now from the ruins of paternal tombs,"Of altars fall'n, and violated fanes,"Loud vengeance calls, a voice our courage hears,"Enlarg'd to pious fury. Spartan, know,"If yet unknowing, of the Attic race
"Not one to treat with Xerxes will survive;"Our wives and offspring shall encumber none;"All we require of Sparta is to march;"That, ere th' expected foe invades our bounds,"The Greeks united on Boeotian plains"May give him battle—Alexander, view"That glorious pow'r, which rolls above our heads;"He first his wonted orbit shall forsake,"Ere we our virtue. Never more appear"Before the presence of Cecropian tribes"With embassies like this; nor, blind by zeal,"Howe'er sincere to Athens, urge again"What is beneath her majesty to bear."I should be griev'd her anger should disgrace"A prince, distinguish'd as her host and friend;"Meantime I pity thy dependent state."Loud acclamations hurried from the sightOf that assembly thy dejected spouse,In his own thoughts dishonour'd. What a lot
Is mine! If Xerxes triumph, I becomeA slave in purple; should the Greeks prevail,Should that Euboean conqueror, the sonOf Neocles be sent th' Athenian scourge. . . .Hear, and take comfort, interpos'd the queen.To thee I come for counsel, sigh'd her lord;I will repose me on thy breast, will hearThy voice, hereafter ever will obey;Thy love, thy charms can sooth my present cares,Thy wisdom ward the future. She proceeds:That Greece will triumph, rest assur'd; no forceOf these untaught Barbarians can resistHer policy and arms. Awhile, dear lord,We must submit to wear the galling maskNecessity imposes. New eventsAre daily scatter'd by the restless palmOf Fortune; some will prove propitious. Wise,
To all men gracious, Aristides serv'dBy us in season will befriend our state.This said, her star-like beauty gilds his gloom,While round them heav'n his midnight curtain drops.By rising dawn th' Oetaean rocks and cavesRing with ten thousand trumps and clarions loud.With all his host the son of Gobryas leavesHis empty'd camp. So rushes from his denThe strong and thick-furr'd animal, who boastsCalisto's lineage; bound in drowsy slothBleak winter he exhausts; when tepid springHis limbs releases from benumbing cold,He reinstates his vigour, and assertsAmong Sarmatian woods his wonted sway.The bands entire of Persians and of Medes,The rest, selected from unnumber'd climes,Compose the army. Forty myriads sweepThy pass, renown'd Thermopylae, to rushOn Grecian cities scatter'd in their view.So by the deep Borystenes in floods
Of frothy rage, by mightier Danube's wave,Nor less by countless congregated streams,The Euxine swoln, through Hellespontine straitsImpels his rapid current; thence extendsAmong th' Aegean isles a turbid maze.Three days the multitude requir'd to passThe rough defile. Masistius in the vanHis sumptuous arms, and all-surpassing formDiscovers. Tiridates leads the rearClos'd by the troops of Macedon, whose kingSat on a car beside his radiant queen.Amid the center, on a milk-white steed,Mardonius rode in armour, plated goldThick set with gems. Before him march'd a guardOf giant size, from each Barbarian tribe,For huge dimension, and terrific mien,Preferr'd. Their captain, from his stature nam'dBriareus, born on Rhodope, display'dThat hundred-handed Titan on his shield.He swung around an iron-studded mace,
In length ten cubits; to his shoulders broadThe hairy spoils of hunted bears supply'dA shaggy mantle; his uncover'd headWas bald, except where nigh the brawny neckShort bushy locks their crisped terrors knit.So his own mountain through surrounding woodsLifts to the clouds a summit bare and smoothIn frost, which glistens by no season thaw'd.Not such is gentle Mindarus behindIn argent mail. Unceasing, on his shieldIntent, Cleora newly painted thereA living beauty, but another's prize,He views, while hopeless passion wastes the hueOf his fair cheek, and elegance of form.Not less th' unrivall'd Amarantha's eyesHad pierc'd the son of Gobryas. Instant sparksOn her appearance from Nicaea firstHad kindled warm desire, which absence cool'd,While she in distant Macedon abode.
When winter melted at the breath of spring,Her sight again amid th' assembling hostReviv'd the fervour of an eastern breastBy nature prone, by wanton licence us'd,To am'rous pleasures. Public duty stillEmploy'd his hours; still smother'd was the flame,Nor on his wishes had occasion smil'd.Ev'n in the absence of Aemathia's princeAt Athens, friendship's unremitted careStill in Sandaucè's chamber held the queenSequester'd, inaccessibly immur'd.Beside Masistius rode a youthful pageOf eastern lineage. He in tend'rest yearsStol'n by perfidious traffickers in slaves,By Medon purchas'd, to Melissa giv'n,By her was nam'd Statirus, and retain'dAmong her holy servitors. This youthOn her benign protector she bestow'd.
Masistius priz'd her token of esteemBeyond himself, and daily bounty show'r'dOn young Statirus. Near the Locrian valeAdvancing now the satrap thus began:O! early train'd by sage Melissa's hand,Gift of her friendship, and in merit dear,Nine months are fled, Statirus, since I bow'dIn docile reverence, not unlike thy own,To her instruction. All her words divineIn precept or narration, from this breastNo time can blot. I now perceive a lake,Which holds an island she hath oft describ'd,Where tombs are mould'ring under cypress shades;There she hath told me, great Oïleus rests.O father of Melissa, should my pow'rTo savage licence of invasion leaveThy dust expos'd, my progress were but smallIn virtue's track; Masistius would disgrace
Thy daughter's guidance—Fly, Statirus, postThese my attendant vassals to protectThat sacred turf; let each battalion passEre ye rejoin me. Uttering this, he hearsThe trumpet's evening signal to encamp.The sun is low; not ent'ring yet the vale,Mardonius halts, and summons to his tentThessalia's chieftain, faithless Greek, approv'dThe Persian's friend, with him th' unwilling princeOf Macedon, to whom the gen'ral thus:To march by dawn your squadrons both prepare:Thou, Larissaean Thorax, in these tractsMy trusted guide, with swift excursion reachThe Isthmus; watch the Spartan motions there.Thou, Alexander, sweep the furthest boundsOf Locris, Doris, Phocis; all their youthIn arms collect; ere thirty days elapse,I shall expect them on the plains of Thebes.He said: The king and Thorax both retire.The morning shines; they execute their charge;The host proceeds. Once happy was the vale,Where Medon's father, and his faithful swain,Now to illustrious Haliartus chang'd,Abode in peace. No longer is retain'dThe verdant smoothness, ridg'd by grating wheelsOf Libyan cars, uptorn by pond'rous hoofsOf trooping steeds and camels. Not this dayIs festive, such as Sparta's king enjoy'd,When lib'ral hospitality receiv'dHis guardian standard on the Oïlean turf.No jocund swain now modulates his pipeTo notes of welcome; not a maiden decksHer hair in flow'rs; mute Philomel, whose throatOnce tun'd her warble to Laconian flutes,Amid barbarian dissonance repines.Now in rude march th' innumerable hostApproach the fountain, whose translucent rills
In murmur lull the passenger's reposeOn beds of moss, in that refreshing cell,To rural peace constructed by the friendOf man, Oïleus. Thither to evadeThe noontide heat the son of Gobryas turns.Briareus, captain of his giant guard,Accosts him ent'ring: Image of the king,A list'ning ear to me thy servant lend;Thou goest to Thebes; far diff'rent is the trackTo Delphi. Shall that receptacle proudOf Grecian treasure, heap'd from earliest times,Yet rest unspoil'd? An earthquake, not the armsOf feeble Delphians, foil'd the first attempt;Not twice Parnassus will disjoint his frame.Let me the precious enterprize resume,Who neither dread the mountain, nor the god.Though not assenting, yet without reproofMardonius looks, postponing his reply.
Hence soon the rumour of a new attemptAgainst the Pythian oracle, the seatOf Amarantha's birth, alarms her soul.Massistius born to virtue, and refin'dBy frequent converse with Melissa pure,The queen consults. Her instant he conveysBefore his friend, to deprecate an actOf sacrilege so fatal once. The cellShe enters. Like Anchises, when his flockOn Ida's mount was folded, at the sightOf Venus, breaking on his midnight hutIn all the radiance of celestial charms,Mardonius stands, and fixes on the queenAn eye transported. At a sign his friendWithdrew, but waited nigh. To her the chief:What fortune brings the fairest of her sexTo her adoring servant? She replies:False sure the rumour which pervades thy camp.A second time to violate the shrineOf Phoebus once provok'd, and sorely felt,Thou canst not mean. The eager Persian then:Admit th' intent; thy interceding voiceProtects Apollo. Not on my requestAvoid an impious action, firm she spake;Weigh thy own danger in offending heav'n,By piety and mercy win its grace.No, all the merit shall be thine, he cried;The favour due from heav'n be all thy own.I ask no more than Amarantha's smileFor my reward; as Phoebus is thy god,Thou art my goddess. Let me worship thus—He stopp'd, and seiz'd her hand with am'rous lipsTo stain those lilied beauties, which surpass'd
Junonian whiteness. Virtue from her eyesFlash'd, and with crimson indignation dy'dHer cheeks: Retire; forget not who I am,Stern she rebuk'd him. He, accustom'd longTo yielding beauty in the wanton East,That torrid clime of love, a stranger heTo elegance of coyness in the sex,Much more to chaste repulse, when ev'ry barBut honour warm occasion hath remov'd,These words austerely utter'd: Am I chang'd?No more Mardonius? Is my dazzling sunOf pow'r and splendour suddenly obscur'd?In state degraded, for a peasant's garbHave I exchang'd my purple? Is my prime,My form, in all th' impurities of ageBy some malignant talisman disguis'd,At once grown loathsome? Who, and what I am,Thou prodigy of coldness and disdain,Remind me. Who, and what thou art, she said,
I will remind thee to confound thee more.No characters of magic have the pow'rTo change a noble and ingenuous mind;Thou hast thyself degraded; thou hast rentThe wreaths, which circle thy commanding brow,And all their splendour wantonly defac'd.Thy rank and pow'r exalted dost thou holdFrom partial heav'n to violate the lawsOf men and gods? True pattern to the worldOf Persian virtues! Now to all thy pomp,Thy steeds, thy chariots, and emblazing gems,The gorgeous pageants of tyrannic state,I leave thee, son of luxury and vice.She said, and darted like a meteor swiftAway, whose aspect red presages woeTo superstition's herd. The Persian's prideIs wounded; tapers to the cell he calls;
By them a tablet, unobserv'd before,Attracts his gloomy eye. The words were these:"The Spartan king a visitant was here,"Who, by a tyrant's multitude o'erpow'r'd,"Died for his country. Be accurst the man,"The man impure, who violates these walls,"Which, by Oïleus hospitably rais'd,"Receiv'd the great Leonidas a guest."Oïlean Medon this inscription trac'd."Another hangs beneath it in this strain:"Laconian Aëmnestus rested here,"From Asia's camp return'd. His faulchion's point"To deities and mortals thus proclaims"His arm to vengeance on Mardonius pledg'd,"The king of Sparta's manes to appease."Brave was the son of Gobryas, like the godOf war in battle; yet a dream, an act
Of froward chance, would oft depress his mind.He recollects with pain the challenge boldFrom that severe Laconian in the tentOf Xerxes; this to Amarantha's scornSucceeding, throws new darkness o'er his gloom.Masistius ent'ring hasty thus began:What hast thou done, Mardonius? When I ledThis princess back, indignant she complain'dOf wrong from thee. Thy countenance is griev'd.Confus'd, Mardonius pointed to the scrolls;Masistius read; he took the word again:Now in the name of Horomazes, chief,Art thou discourag'd by a Grecian vaunt,Or by that empty oracle which claim'dAtonement for Leonidas? DespiseMysterious words and omens like a man.
But if thou bear'st the conscience of a deedUnworthy, just thy sorrow; like a manFeel due contrition, and the fault repair.I have meant wrong, not acted, said the chief.Greece once produc'd a Helen, who forsookA throne and husband; what these later damesCall honour, which without an eunuch guardProtects their charms, in Asia is unknown.Resentful, gall'd at first, I now admireThis lofty woman, who, like Helen bright,Rejected me a lover, who surpassThe son of Priam. Thou art gentler farThan I, discreet Masistius; sooth by mornWith lenient words, and costly gifts, her ire.Call Mindarus, together let us feast;He too is gentle, I am rough and hot,Whom thou canst guide, Masistius, thou alone.Soon Mindarus appears in aspect sad;Soon is the royal equipage produc'd,Which Xerxes gave Mardonius to sustainHis delegated state. Ye rustic pow'rs!Ye Dryads, Oreads of th' Oïlean seat!Ye Naiads white of lucid brooks and founts!Had you existence other than in talesOf fancy, how had your astonish'd eyesAt piles of gold enrich'd by orient gemsBeen dimm'd with lustre? Genius of the cell.Simplicity had fram'd to rural peace!How hadst thou started at a Persian board?Fair female minstrels charm the sight and ear;Effeminating measures on their lutesDissolve the soul in languor, which admitsNo thought but love. Their voices chance directsTo sing of Daphnè by Apollo chas'd,Of him inflam'd at beauties in her flight
Disclos'd, him reaching with a vain embraceThose virgin beauties, into laurel chang'dOn flowry-bank'd Orontes, Syrian stream.Mardonius sighs at disappointed love;Tears down the cheeks of Mindarus descend,Recalling dear Cleora, not as deadRecall'd, but living in another's arms.Not so the firmness of Masistius yields;The soft, lascivious theme his thoughts reject,By pure affections govern'd. Yet the charmOf harmony prevailing serves to raiseCompos'd remembrance of Melissa's lyre,Which oft in stillness of a moon-light hour,Amid her nymphs in symphony high-ton'd,To moderation, equity, and faith,To deeds heroic and humane she struck
With force divine, reproving lawless will,Intemp'rate paffions, turpitude of mind,And savage manners in her ethic lay.The banquet ends, and all depart to rest.End of the Twenty-first Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the TWENTY-SECOND.BY morn return'd Masistius: Hear, he said,Th' event unpleasing from thy passion sprung.Mardonius, thy temerity hath chac'dFrom Persia's camp the Macedonian queen;I found her tent abandon'd; but her courseConjecture cannot trace. What other styleThan of Barbarians can the Greeks affordTo us of Asia? Lo! a youthful king,Our best ally, and my distinguish'd friend,Exerts a distant effort in our cause,
Meantime the honour of his queen, by allAdor'd, inviolate till now, our chiefInsults, by station her protector sole,When I am absent. Not thyself aloneThou hast disgrac'd, but me her guardian pledg'dBy sacred oaths to Macedonia's lord.These words, evincing nature's purest gifts,Deserving that society sublimeWith Grecian muses, where Melissa pour'dHer moral strain, in perturbation plungeThe hearer; when importunate, abruptAppears Briareus, and renews the suitTo pillage Delphi. No, in wrath repliedThe clouded son of Gobryas; bring my steed;March all to Thebes. Then humble as a child,Who to parental castigation ownsHis fault in tears, Masistius he address'd:How bless'd the mind by Horomazes fram'dLike thine, serene Masistius, to resistUnruly passions! never warm desires,Pride, or ambition, vex thy equal thoughts,Which from their level no dejection low'rs;Yet none surpasses thee in rank and pow'rAmong the satraps. Uncorrupted man!O, in thyself superior to thy state,Me, who so often sink below my own,Befriend in this dark moment. I foresee,I feel disaster in this harsh event.Masistius here: Reflect, thou mighty chief,At either gate of life, the first and last,Yet more through all their intermediate space,Vicissitude and hazard lurk unseen,Supplanting wary steps. To mortal pow'rThose dreadful ministers of jealous heav'n,The elements, are hostile, and to low'rThe great with changing fortune oft conspire.
Her cruel sport, Mardonius, need we temptWith our own follies? In thy arduous postThy hand sustains a balance, where the livesOf nations, where an empire's fate is pois'dFrom hour to hour against the common illsOf chance and nature, which so often foilThe wifest; do not super-add the weightOf thy own passions to the adverse scale.I, who am ever to thy virtues just,Will not be slow, though grieving at thy faults,To furnish present help. Farewell; I mountMy swiftest courser to o'ertake the queen,Whose indignation I can best compose.Mardonius then: Adventure is a chaceThy virtue, no idolatress of fame,Enjoys; thy prompters are the love of right,Care for a friend, or zeal for Persia's state,Which render hazardous attempts thy bliss,
Sublime Masistius. Thou hast weight to aweMardonius, who thy enterprising handLaments, but never to controul assumes,Yet feels and most regrets his own defects,Whene'er they cause thy absence. Here they endDiscourse. Of cavalry a num'rous pow'r,Train'd by himself, Masistius heads, and leavesThe army filing tow'rds Boeotian fields.He bends his course to Delphi; he attainsPermessus, round the Heliconian heightsIn argent mazes whisp'ring, as he flows,To passengers along the winding way,Which skirts the mountain, and o'erlooks the stream.Back from the ford the satrap's courser startsAffrighted. Lo! to crimson, as of blood,In sudden change the late crystalline wave,Melodious solace of the sacred nine,Rolls horrible to view. Anon with helms,
With spears and bucklers, grating o'er the bedOf loosen'd stone, with limbs and trunks of men,The turbid current chafes. Masistius spursThrough all obstruction; in his forc'd careerThe clank of armour, crash of spears, and shoutsOf battle strike his ear; the vocal rocksAugment the animating sound; he seesA flying soldier, by his target knownA Macedonian guard, who stops, and thus:Hail! satrap, hail! thou timely sent by heav'n,Haste and protect the Macedonian queen.A host of robbers, by the lawless timesCombin'd, have vanquish'd our inferior force;Part of our mangled number choak that flood,Part on the ground lie bleeding. At these wordsMasistius rushes with his pond'rous lanceIn rest; Emathia's beauteous queen in flightBefore pursuing ruffians he perceives
On her fleet courser. Thunderbolt of strength,He hurls to earth their leader giant-siz'd,A profligate deserter from the guardMardonian. Next a Phocian born, expell'dHis native residence for crimes, he flew;The active staff is broken in the chestOf an Arcadian, branded by his stateWith infamy; the victor then unsheathsHis sabre, op'ning through the savage routA passage wide for death. His faithful trainSurround them; irresistible he sweepsThe traitors headlong to the flood below,Which foams like Simois, by Pelides swolnWith Trojan dead, and struggling to dischargeTh' unwonted load in Neptune's briny waste.The conqueror dismounts; before the queenHis gracious form presenting, in the armsOf his sustaining friends he sudden sinks,
Oppress'd by wounds unheeded, ev'n unfeltAmid the warmth of action. Then her veilShe rends asunder, and, lamenting, beatsHer grateful breast. The notes of sorrow, loudThrough all the concourse, dissipate his trance.Serene these words he utters: Honour's trackIs perilous, though lovely; there to walk,Not fearing death, nor coveting his stroke,Though to receive it ever well prepar'd,Has been my choice and study. But, fair queen,Be not discourag'd at my present state,Wounds are to me familiar, and their cures;To Delphi lead me, or whatever place,Thy wish prefers. Masistius comes thy guard,So will continue, and, ere long restor'd,Hath much for thy instruction to impart.While these to Delphi, on his march to ThebesAdvanc'd the son of Gobryas. Soon the steps
Innumerous of men and coursers bruiseOn green Cephissian meads the growth of May.Copaeae's lake, perfum'd with orange groves,Which rude unsated violence deforms,The multitudes envelop; thence alongThe sedgy borders of Ismenus reachCadmēan walls, when now the golden sunSev'n times had fill'd his orbit. Thebes admitsThe Persian gen'ral, in these words address'dBy Leontiades: Thrice welcome, lord,We, thy allies, our counsel to discloseHave waited long. Not hazarding a fight,Thou hast the means to ascertain success.Here seated tranquil, from exhaustless storesDistribute gold among the Grecian states;Corrupt the pow'rful, open faction's mouth,Divide, nor doubt to overcome that strength,Which, link'd in union, will surmount the forceOf all mankind. The ardent Persian here:To court th' Athenians with a lavish handHave I not stoop'd already? but, disdain'd,That haughty race to destiny I leave.Have I not bid defiance to their boast,Themistocles? Him, forfeiting his word,Pledg'd to confront me on Boeotian plains,I haste to summon at his native gates.What are the Greeks, if Athens be reduc'd?Where are the vaunted Spartans? lock'd in fearBehind their isthmian wall, by heav'n in fearOf Thorax ranging with a slender bandOf his Thessalian horse. Thou rule in Thebes,Brave Mindarus, till I from Athens tam'dReturn with fetters for the rest of Greece.He seeks his couch, and, after short repose,By twilight bursts like thunder from a cloud,Which, on Olympus hov'ring black, containsThe livid store of Jove's collected wrath
Against offending mortals. O'er a landDeserted, silent, to the empty roofsOf Athens was the march. Mardonius climb'dAegaleos, thence on Salamis descry'dThat much-enduring people, who againFor liberty forsook their native homesOn his approach. His gen'rous pride relents;He wishes such a nation were a friend;His wishes waken in his breast an aweAt such a foe. Murichides was nigh,A Hellespontine Grecian of his train,Nor in his favour low; to him he spake:Look on that haughty, but that gallant race;Perhaps at me, by myriads thus begirt,Their very children lift their little handsIn menaces, and cursing lisp the namesOf Xerxes and Mardonius. Mount a bark;Pass with a herald to that crowded isle;
The senators accost; the people shun,In pride beyond nobility; repeatThe words Aemathian Alexander us'd:"Ye men of Athens, repossess your homes;"Enlarg'd dominion from the royal hand"Ask and obtain; be govern'd by your laws;"The son of Gobryas will rebuild your fanes;"Accept the king's alliance, and be free"With added strength and splendour." Further say,They little know what confidence is dueTo him who sends thee. Asian Greeks, subdu'dBy me, retain their democratic rights.On Salamis the Hellespontine lands;Before th' Athenian senate he displaysThe Persian proffer. All indignant hearBut Lycides, who thus exhorting spake:From Athens twice expell'd, deserted twiceBy Lacedaemon, who her toil employs
Still on her isthmian fence, who lifts no shieldTo guard our wives and progeny, to saveFrom desolation our defenceless fields,Or from our homes repel the hostile blaze,What can we better, injur'd and betray'd,Than listen to Mardonius? be referr'dHis terms of friendship to th' assembling tribes.The universal senate rose in scornOf such submission. By the people known,His counsel rous'd enthusiastic rage,Nor Aristides can the tumult cool;They stone the timid senator to death.The women catch the spirit; fierce, as fair,Laodice collects th' infuriate sex.They hand in hand a dreadful circle formAround his mansion, and his wife and raceDoom to perdition, that his coward bloodMay ne'er survive in Greece. Enormous thought!
Perhaps not less than such excess of zealExcess of peril in that season claim'dTo save a land, which foster'd ev'ry muse;That eloquence, philosophy and artsMight shine in Attic purity of lightTo latest ages: but a sudden fleet,In wide array extending on the shore,Suspends the deed. Before each wond'ring eyeTimothea lands, Sicinus at her side;When thus the matron to th' impatient throng:His native friends Themistocles salutes;Euboean plenty in your present needHe sends. Returning, I this crouded isleWill disencumber, and to safety bearYour wives and infants; open to their wantsEudora holds her Amarynthian seat;Elephenor, Tisander to the shrinesOf Jove invite them, and to friendly roofs
Euboea's towns. As oft Aurora shedsSerenity around her, when the gatesOf light first open to her fragrant step;Hush'd at her feet lies Boreas, who had rentThe dusky pall of night, and Jove restrainsThe thunder's roar, and torrents of the skies;Such was Timothea's presence, so the storm,By furies late excited, at her voiceWas tame. She learns the melancholy fateOf Lycides, to her protection takesHis helpless orphans, and disastrous wife.Now of its plenteous stores while eager handsThe num'rous fleet unlade, and Attic damesPrepare with good Timothea to embark;Just Aristides, first of men, conductsThat first of matrons to his joyful tent,Where she began: O righteous like the gods,Now hear my whole commission, and believe
Themistocles, my husband, feels thy worth.When at his summons on Euboea's coastI landed first, "Thrice welcome," he exclaim'd,"From Athens hither to a safe abode."A second emigration I presage"To her afflicted race." From port to portAround Euboea's populous extentWith him convey'd, I saw her wealthy townsTo his controul subordinate. Their pow'rsHe now is gath'ring; some achievement newHe meditates, which secresy concealsLike fate's dark roll inscrutable to all.From thee an early notice he requests,Soon as the Greeks, united in one camp,The sole attention of Mardonius draw;Th' intelligence to bring I leave behindThat faithful man, Sicinus. Virtuous dame,Wise is thy husband, Aristides spake;From him no other than achievements high,
However my conjecture they surpass,I still expect. Themistocles apprise,That I am bound for Sparta to upbraidPausanias proud, and summon to the fieldThat selfish breed so martial, yet so coldTo public welfare. Let me next preferTo thy benignity a fervent suit.He straight withdrew, and reappearing ledTwo little damsels humble in attire.Behold my daughters, he resum'd; admitThese to thy care; now motherless they wantProtection; ev'n Euphemia they have lost;My venerable parent have the godsReleas'd but newly from the growing sceneOf trouble. Athens must a parent proveTo these hereafter, fated to receiveNo portion from a father, who delights
In poverty. His arms are all the wealthOf Aristides. With a tender handShe takes the children: O! of men, she said,Most rich, whose wealth is virtue, in the nameOf household gods this office I accept.O Aristides! these shall mix with mine;These shall contribute to cement the work,I long have wrought, the amity begunBetwixt Themistocles and thee. In tearsDepart the infant maidens from a sireOf gentlest nature, and in manners blandNot less, than just. Meanwhile to Athens steersMurichides unharm'd. The rising dawnSees with her precious charge Timothea sail.Lo! from the city clouds of smoke ascendVoluminous, with interlacing flames,Such as Vesuvius vomits from his gulphSulphureous, when unquenchable the heat
Within his concave melts the surging oreTo floods of fire. Murichides had toldHis fruitless embassy; Mardonius, wildWith ire, to instant conflagration doom'dTh' abode of such inexorable foes.They, on the margin opposite, beheldTheir ancient residence a second timeDestroy'd; nor utter'd more than just complaintOf tardy Sparta. When Briareus direWith his gigantic savages o'erturn'dThe recent tomb, which held the glorious slainAt Salamis; when scatter'd in the windThey saw that dust rever'd; in solemn rage,Devoid of sound illiberal, or loud,Each his right hand with sanctity of oathsPledg'd to his neighbour, and to vengeance fullHis blood devoted. Aristides look'd,As some incens'd divinity, and spake:Persist, ye sons of folly; crush that tomb;The last repose of yon heroic slainDisturb, therein exhibiting your doomFrom mortals, and immortals. Thus your prideBy heav'n, and Grecian valour, shall be crush'd,Your impious host be scatter'd like that dustWhich your barbarity profanes. Now, friends,By your appointment I to Sparta sail;You under watchful discipline remainCompos'd and firm; such patience will surmountAll obstacle, Athenians; will restoreIn brighter glories your paternal seats.This said, the isle he leaves, selecting none,But Cimon for associate. In the barkHim Aristides placidly bespake:Son of Miltiades the great in arms,Thy early youth was dissolute; thy lookIngenuous still, and frank thy tongue, reveal'd
Internal virtue; friendship on my partSucceeded, thence a study to reclaimThy human frailties. I rejoice in hope,Thou wilt hereafter prove an Attic star,In council wise, triumphant in the field,Humane to strangers, to thy country just,Friend to her laws, to all her Muses kind,Who may record thy actions. Cimon here:If I have virtues, they proceed from thee;If I attain to glory, I shall oweTo thee my lustre. To deserve thy praise,What have I yet accomplish'd? I have foughtAt Salamis, what more performing thereThan each Athenian? Aristides then:True, all were brave; my judgment doth not restOn one exploit; thy modesty o'erlooksThe signs of worth and talents, whence my hopes
Have rank'd thee first of Grecians. To acquire,To keep that station, Cimon, be thy choice;Thou hast the means; but this impression hold,Who would excel, must be a moral man.Thus they exhaust their voyage of a day,When at Troezenè they arrive, and findRenown'd Cleander training for the fieldHis native bands. To Sparta thence they sail.The Ephori assemble, when they hearOf Aristides, who an audience claims;He comes before them, and austerely thus:Cecropia's race, exterminated twice,Demand of Sparta, whether sloth, or fear,Or Persian gold her buckler hath unbrac'd.Mardonius proffer'd more than equal terms,Not friendship singly, but enlarg'd domainTo Athens, who to eleutherian Jove,
To Greece was faithful, and the lib'ral giftDisdain'd. Your own ambassador pronounc'dYour phalanx ready; for its speedy marchHis head he pledg'd. Mardonius takes the field,He lays th' Athenian territory waste;Where are the Spartans? Adding work to workFor their own sep'rate safety at their wall,Inglorious isthmian wall, while half the GreeksBecome your foes, and Athens is betray'd.Pausanias present proudly thus replied:Hast thou not heard, the Hyacinthian ritesEmploy the Spartans? shall the heads of GreeceBe question'd, be directed when to actBy you Athenians? your inferior stateMay wait our leisure. Aristides here:Talk'st thou to me of Hyacinthian games,While rude Barbarians riot in our fields,
While Athens burns, while sacrilege invadesOur temples, while our ancestors we seeTorn from the grave? Pausanias, thou disgraceTo thy forefather Hercules, whose arm,To friends a bulwark, was a scourge to foes,What hast thou said? But, guardian to the sonOf that renown'd Leonidas, who foughtBeyond the isthmus, and for Greece expir'd,If thou retain'st no rev'rence for his blood,If thou dost scorn Lycurgus and his laws,If holding liberty an empty name,Art now in treaty with a lawless king,No more of words. Athenians have their choiceTo treat with Xerxes, or to distant climesExpand the sail, resigning to their fateUnfaithful, timid Grecians, who have lostAll claim to succour—Yet assume your swords!My love for Greece solicits you in tears.Be thou, Pausanias, general of all;
We in that noble warfare will refuseNo hardship—Ev'n thy arrogant commandI like the meanest soldier will abide.Then Aëmnestus brief: O righteous man,I feel thy wrongs; Laconia's shame I feel,Which if delay still blackens, thou shalt leadMe, the due victim of Athenian wrath,Before those injur'd tribes, by me deceiv'd;Where my own sword shall sacrifice the blood,I pledg'd for Sparta's faith. Meantime withdraw;I was thy guest in Athens, thou be mine.Not till the day-spring Aëmnestus greetsHis Attic friend: Our citizens are march'd;All night my indefatigable toilHath urg'd the phalanx on; the various statesWithin the isthmus will obey our call;Now speed with me, o'ertake, inspect our host.They both depart with Cimon. Sparta's camp,Ere Phoebus couches, Aristides gains;The marshall'd pupils of Lycurgus thereHe, ever true to equity, applauds,Who their disgraceful sloth in council blam'd.Subordination, silent order heldEach in his place; in look, as virgins, meek,Sedate they listen'd to their chiefs, as youthTo learning's voice in academic schools.Thus in some fertile garden well-manur'd,The regularity of plants and treesEnrich'd with produce, on a stable rootStands permanent, by skilful care dispos'dAt first, and sedulously wateh'd. No vauntOffends the ear, nor supercilious frownOf confidence the eye. Th' Athenian chiefContent returns; on Salamis receiv'd,Cecropia's bands he marshals for the field.The ravage still of Attica detain'dMardonius. Thorax of Larissa quitsHis isthmian station; rapid in his courseTo Gobryas' son these tidings he imparts:The isle of Pelops musters all her pow'rs;The isthmus swarms; forsake this rocky landFor cavalry unfit; collect thy forceTo face the Grecians on Cadmēan plains.Her sleepy sword at last has Sparta rous'd,Replies Mardonius? On Cadmean plainsThe Persian trump shall sound; Cithaeron's hill,Asopian banks, shall soon repeat the notesTriumphal. Swift he rushes back to Thebes,Ere Phoebus darted his solstitial heat.As some hot courser, who from pasture ledReplete with food and courage, spurns the groundIn confidence and pride, no sooner meets
His wonted rider, than admits the rein;Such was Mardonius, when from Theban gatesMasistius thus address'd him: Be inform'd,That Macedonia's sov'reign is arriv'd,With his fair consort. Her to Delphi's wallsI guarded, there deliver'd to her lord,Who hath conducted fifty thousand GreeksIn arms, auxiliar to thy camp. The queen,Now at a fabric old, to Dircè built,Close by her fountain, and beset with shade,Dwells in retreat, which careful thou avoid.But tell me, son of Gobryas, whither flownWas all thy magnanimity, when flamesA second time laid stately Athens low?Though disappointed, couldst thou deem a crimeHer constancy, refusing to betrayA common cause? Mardonius, thou dost hopeTo conquer; why a city of renown,Which in her beauty would have grac'd our sway,
Hast thou reduc'd to ashes? Oh! reflect,What fires of stern resistance and revengeThis act hath lighted in such gallant hearts.That pow'r eternal, by the hallow'd nameOf Horomazes worshipp'd in our clime,Who earth and seas and firmament controuls,With all therein, looks down not less on Greece,Than Persia, both his creatures. Just and wise,Intemp'rate deeds in either he resents.Mardonius answer'd: By that pow'r I swear,Thou to a Grecian almost art transform'dBy intercourse with yon religious hillOf thy admir'd Melissa. Do I blame?Ah! no; too awful art thou to incurMy censure. O Masistius, I confessThy genius purer, more sublime, than mine;I often err, thou never—But, dear friend,I am dejected ever when thou chid'st;
Yet thee, my chiding monitor, should fateSnatch from Mardonius, he would rise no more.I only seek to warn thee, not deject,Rejoins Masistius; turn to other cares;Greece is in arms; address thee to thy charge.This said, to council they in Thebes proceed.End of the Twenty-second Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the TWENTY-THIRD.THE Heliconian records now unfold,Calliopè! harmonious thence reciteThe names and numbers of the various Greeks,Who in array on fair Boeotian plains,With gleams of armour streak the twinkling waveOf clear Asopus. Troezen known to fame,Where Pittheus dwelt, whose blood to Athens gaveThe hero Theseus, Troezen from her wallsIn circuit small, from Hylycus her stream,From her Scyllaean promontory high,
From vine-attir'd Methenè, from the isles,Calauria, Neptune's seat, and Sphaeria dearTo Pallas, daughter of almighty Jove,Two thousand warriors sends. Cleander pass'dThe isthmus first; who manly, from the bedOf Ariphilia rising, vow'd to deckHer future cradle with a victor's wreathOf laurel new. Her beauteous image grac'dHis four-fold buckler. Twice eight hundred youthsFrom Aesculapian Epidaurus march'd,From mount Cynortius, and the sacred hill,Titthēon, where the mother of that godMedicinal in secret left her fruitOf stolen enjoyment in Apollo's arms;Where in serenity of smiles was foundThe sweet Phoebean child, while lambent flamesPlay'd round his temples. Clitophon the chief,A serpent green, the symbol of his god,Bore on his silver shield. Four hundred left
Leprēum, clear Arenè, and th' impureAnigrian waters, where the centaur, fellPolenor, wounded by Herculean shafts,Dipp'd in the blood of Hydra, purg'd his limbsFrom putrid gore, envenoming the stream;Their leader Conon. Of Mycenae old,Of Tiryns, built by fam'd Cyclopian toil,Eight hundred shields Polydamas commands.Two thousand gallant youths, with standards bless'dAt Hebe's altar, tutelary pow'rOf Phlius, bold Menander led to war.Himself was young; the blooming goddess shoneBright on his buckler. Under Lycus braveHermionè, fair city, had enroll'dSix hundred spears. The impress on his shieldWas strong Alcides, dragging from the gatesOf Dis their latrant guardian triple-mouth'dThrough an abyss in Hermionean land,The fabled wonder of the district shewn.
Three thousand sail'd from Cephallenia's isle,From Acarnanian, and Epirot shores,With various chieftains. Of Arcadian breedOrchomenus twelve hundred, Tegea sentThree thousand. Chileus, prime in Tegea's camp,Was skill'd in arms, and vaunted high the name,The rank and prowess of his native state.Ten thousand helms from wealthy Corinth's wallsBlaze o'er the champaign; these Alcmaeon leadsWith Adimantus. Neighb'ring Sicyon arm'dSix thousand more; amidst whose splendid filesAutomedon commanded. Lo! in airA mighty banner! from the hollows green,The wood-crown'd hills in Lacedaemon's rule,Taijgetus, and Menelaian ridge,From Crocean quarries, from Gythēum's port,Therapnè, sweet Amyclae on the banksOf fam'd Eurotas, from a hundred towns,A glitt'ring myriad of Laconians shew
Their just arrangement. Aemnestus thereLists his tall spear, and rises o'er his ranksIn arduous plumes and stature. So the strengthAnd stately foliage of a full-grown oakO'erlooks the undershades, his knotted armsAbove their tops extending. Mightier stillCallicrates appears, in martial deedsSurpassing ev'ry Grecian. He his fateForesees not; he, capricious fortune's mark,Must fall untimely, and his gen'rous bloodUnprofitably shed. A firmer bandSucceeds. Huge Sparta, who forever scorn'dDefensive walls and battlements, suppliedFive thousand citizens close-mail'd; a trainOf sev'n bold Helots exercis'd in arms,Attend each warrior; there Pausanias tow'r'd.In pride the son of Atreus he surpass'dWithout his virtues, a superior hostCommanding. Never Greece such heroes sent,
Nor such a pow'r in multitude to war;For landed recent on the neighb'ring shoreTh' Athenian phalanx opens broad in sightTheir eleutherian banner. They advanceEight thousand men at arms; an equal forceIn archers, slingers, missile-weapon'd sonsOf terror follow. Round her naval flagAlready four bold myriads from her loinsHad Attica enroll'd. What chiefs preside!Themistocles, Xanthippus in remote,But glorious action; Aristides here,Myronides and Cimon, Clinias, sireOf Alcibiades, the warrior bard,Young Pericles, and more than time hath seenSince or before, in arts and arms renown'd.The ancient foe of Athens, yet averseLike her to Xerxes, Megara enroll'dSix thousand warriors. From Aegina sail'd
A thousand. Twice six hundred, Phoenix-like,Sprung from the ashes of Plataea burnt,With Arimnestus march'd, th' intrepid friendOf him, whose deeds Thermopylae resounds,Diomedon. From Thespia, who had shar'dPlataea's doom, two thousand came unarm'd,Unclad, a want by Attic stores supplied.Alcimedon was chief, of kindred bloodTo Dithyrambus; whom, his early bloomFor Greece devoting, on Melissa's hillThe Muses sing and weep. Between the rootsOf tall Cithaeron, and th' Asopian floods,The army rang'd. The Spartans on the rightOne wing compos'd; the men of Tegea claim'dThe left in pref'rence to th' Athenian host.Contention rose; Pausanias sat the judge,Callicrates and Aemnestus wise,His two assessors; thick Laconian ranksA circle form; when Chileus thus asserts
The claim of Tegea: Spartans, from the time,The early time, that Echemus, our king,In single combat on the listed fieldO'erthrew the invader Hyllus, and preserv'dUnspoil'd the land of Pelops, we obtain'dFrom all her sons unanimous this post,Whene'er united in a common causeThey march'd to battle. Not with you we strive,Ye men of Sparta, at your choice commandIn either wing; the other we reclaimFrom Athens; brave and prosp'rous we have join'dOur banners oft with yours; our deeds you know;To ours superior what can Athens pleadOf recent date, or ancient? for what causeShould we our just prerogative resign?Then Aristides spake: Collected hereAre half the Grecians to contend in armsWith Barbarous invaders, not in words
Each with the other for precedence vain.From his own volume let the tongue of time,Not mine, proclaim my countrymen's exploitsIn early ages. In his course he viewsThe varying face of nature, sea to land,Land turn'd to sea, proud cities sink in dust,The low exalted, men and manners change,From fathers brave degen'rate sons proceed,And virtuous children from ignoble sires.What we are now, you, Grecians, must decideAt this important crisis. Judges, fixOn Marathon your thoughts, that recent stageOf preservation to the public weal,Where fifty nations, arm'd to conquer Greece,We unassisted foil'd; more fresh, the dayOf Salamis recall. Enough of words;No more contention for the name of rank;The bravest stand the foremost in the sightOf gods and mortals. As to you is meet,
Determine, Spartans; at your will arrangeTh' Athenians; they acknowledge you the chiefsOf this great league, for gen'ral safety fram'd,Wherever plac'd, obedient they will fight.The sense of all his countrymen he breath'd,Who for the public welfare in this hourTheir all relinquish, and their very prideA victim yield to virtue. From his seat,Inspir'd by justice, Aemnestus rose:Brave as they are, our friends of Tegea seemTo have forgot the Marathonian field,The Salaminian trophies; else this strifeHad ne'er alarm'd the congregated hostOf states so various and remote. As briefCallicrates subjoins: Not less our friendsOf Tegea seem forgetful, that their claim
Within the isthmus is confin'd, the giftOf part, not binding universal Greece.Athenian moderation had beforeWon ev'ry Spartan; loud they sound the nameOf Athens, Athens, whose pretension justThe general confirms, restoring peace.So in a chorus full the manly bassDirects the pow'r of harmony to floatOn equal pinions, and attune the air.Now Sparta's wide encampment on the rightWas form'd; sedate and silent was the toil,As is the concourse of industrious ants,In mute attention to their public cares.Extending thence, successive states erectTheir standards. On the left their num'rous tentsTh' Athenians pitch. In labour not unlikeThe buzzing tenants of sonorous hives,
Loquacious they and lively cheer the field,Yet regularly heed each signal giv'nBy staid commanders. Underneath a fringeOf wood, projecting from Cithaeron's side,Ascends the chief pavilion. Seated thereIs Aristides at a frugal board,An aged menial his attendant sole;But from the tribes selected, round him watchAn hundred youths, whose captain is the sonOf fam'd Miltiades. The neighb'ring bedOf pure Asopus, from Cithaeron's founts,Refreshment inexhaustible contain'd.His arms th' Athenian patriot in his tentWas now exploring, when he hears the stepOf Aemnestus ent'ring, who began:Most wise of men and righteous, whom all Greece,Not Athens singly, as her glory claims,Grant me an hour. Laconian laws, thou know'st,
Subordination to excess enjoin.I am obedient to the man, who holdsSupreme command by office, rank, and birth,While thee my heart confesses and admitsMy sole adviser. Haughty and morose,O'er uncommunicated thoughts will broodOur dark Pausanias; I may often wantThy counsel; now instruct me. Is it meet,We cross th' Asopus to assail the foe,Or wait his coming? Let him come, repliesThe Attic sage; let bold invaders courtA battle, not th' invaded, who must watchOccasion's favour. Present in thy mindRetain, that Greece is center'd in this host,Which if we hazard lightly were a crime,Th' offended gods with fetters would chastise:Our Attic flame to sudden onset points,By me discourag'd. Aemnestus then:Know, that with me Callicrates unites;Farewell; thy wisdom shall direct us both.The sun was set; th' unnumber'd eyes of heav'nThin clouds envelop'd; dusky was the veilOf night, not sable; placid was the air;The low-ton'd current of Asopus heldNo other motion than his native flow,Alluring Aristides in a walkContemplative to pace the stable vergeAttir'd in moss. The hostile camp he views,Which by Masistian vigilance and artWith walls of wood and turrets was secur'd.For this the groves of Jupiter supremeOn Hypatus were spoil'd, Teumessian brows,Mesabius, Parnes, were uncover'd all.Square was th' inclosure, ev'ry face emblaz'dWith order'd lights. Each elevated tentOf princely satraps, and, surmounting all,
Mardonius, thine, from coronets of lampsShot lustre, soft'ning on the distant edgeOf wide Plataean fields. A din confus'dProclaim'd Barbarians; silent was the campOf Greece. These thoughts the spectacle excitesIn Aristides: Slender is thy bound,Asopus, long to separate such hosts,Or keep thy silver wave from blood unstain'd.Lord of Olympus! didst thou want the pow'r,Or, boundless pow'r possessing, want the willThy own created system to secureFrom such destruction? Wherefore on this plainIs Europe thus, and adverse Asia metFor human carnage? Natural this search,Yet but a waste of reason. Let me shunUnprofitable wand'rings o'er the landObscure of trackless mystery; to seeThe path of virtue open is enough.Whate'er the cause of evil, he, who knows
Himself not partner in that cause, attainsEnough of knowledge; all the rest is dreamOf falsely-styl'd philosophy. My taskIs to destroy the enemies of Greece;Be active there, my faculties, and loseNor time, nor thought. Revisiting his tent,Sicinus call'd apart he thus instructs:Return, discreet and faithful, to the sonOf Neocles; thy own observing eyeWill prompt thy tongue; this notice sole I send.We will not hurry to a gen'ral fight.Bless in my name Timothea; bless her sons,Her daughters; nor, good man, o'erlook my own.Six monthly periods of the solar courseWere now complete; intense the summer glow'd.The patient Greeks for eight successive daysEndure the insults of Barbarian horse
Behind their lines; when eager to his friendThe Persian gen'ral: Best belov'd of men,Impart thy counsel. Lo! this vaunted raceLurk in their trenches, and avoid the plain.To him Masistius: I have mark'd a postAccessible and feeble in their line.To me thy choicest cavalry commit,I at the hazard of my life will gall,Perhaps may force that quarter. Ah! my friend,Mardonius answer'd, shall thy precious lifeBe hazarded? let others take the charge,Briareus, Midias, Tiridates brave,Or Mindarus; a thousand leaders boldThis host affords. Masistius, in the gloomOf midnight from my pillow I discern'dThy gracious figure on a steed of fire;Who bore thee up to heav'n, where sudden foldsOf radiant vapour wrapp'd thee from my view.
At once throughout th' innumerable tentsTheir hue was chang'd to black; Boeotia's hillsAnd caves with ejulation from the campRebellow'd round; the camels, horses, mules,Dissolv'd in tears. Let Mithra's angry beamPierce this right arm, annihilate my strength,And melt my courage! I will rest contentTo purchase thus the safety of my friend.Masistius answer'd: Son of Gobryas, learn,That he, who makes familiar to his mindThe certainty of death, and nobly daresIn virtue's clear pursuit, may look sereneOn boding dreams, and auguries averse.No sign, but honour, he requires; he wantsNo monitor, but duty. An attempt,My observation hath maturely weigh'd,Belongs to me; to others less inform'dI will not leave the danger. Quick replies
Disturb'd Mardonius, while at friendship's warmthAmbition melts, and honour fills his breast:O! worthier far than frail Mardonius, takeO'er all the host of Xerxes chief command;Me from temptation, him from danger guard.Again Masistius: Son of Gobryas, peace;My ear is wounded. Ever dost thou sinkBelow the level of thy worth with me,With others soar'st too high. What means the wordTemptation? what this danger to the king?O satrap! listed by his grace so high,Thou hast o'erwhelm'd Masistius. May the GodOf truth and justice strengthen in thy soulThe light ingenuous, which so much reveals;That sense of duty may suppress a thought,I dare not clothe in language. Still in mind
The parting words of Artemisia bear,Which in its blameless moments oft thy tongueRepeats with admiration. "Look," she said,"Look only, where no mystery can lurk,"On ev'ry manly duty. Nothing dark"O'ershades the track of virtue; plain her path;"But superstition, chosen for a guide,"Misleads the best and wisest." Let me add,Worse is the guide ambition, which misleadsTo more than error, to atrocious acts.I shall despair, Masistius, if thou fall'st,Rejoins Mardonius. Must Masistius thenConsort with women, shut from noble deeds,Subjoins the virtuous Persian? Can thy hand,Thy friendly hand, now rivetted in mine,Of my degree, and dignity of birthDeprive me, or obliterate the name
With all its lustre, which my fathers leftMe to uphold? Or wouldst thou, if impow'r'd,Taint my firm spirit with an eunuch's fear,Among their feeble train my rank confine,My strength unnerve, my fortitude debase?While these subsist with titles, wealth and state,While, as I pass, the crouding myriads shout,Here comes Masistius; what is less requir'dFrom him, than deeds to manifest a soul,Which merits such distinction? We againThis day will meet, Mardonius—but as noneOf human texture can the flight foreseeOf that inevitable dart, which soon,Or late will strike, I leave these words behind.If, blinded still by superstition's cloud,Thou wilt believe me in this hour the markOf fate, retain them, as my dying words:Ambition curb; let virtue be thy pride.They separated sad; Mardonius stillForeboding evil to his noble friend,He at the frailty of Mardonius griev'd.Masistius, soon collecting round his tentThe prime of Persian cavalry, bespakeTheir captains thus: Your steeds and arms prepare;String well your bows, your quivers store with shafts;With num'rous javelins each his courser load.I am this day your gen'ral; I relyOn your known prowess; and I trust, the handOf Horomazes will conduct you backVictorious; but remember, that the braveIn life, or death, accomplishing their part,Are happy. All, rejoicing in a chiefBelov'd, his orders sedulous fulfil.In arms, more splendid than for Peleus' sonTh' immortal artist forg'd, Masistius cas'd
His limbs of beauteous frame, and manly grace,To match that hero, whom Scamander sawWith Dardan blood imbru'd. In hue of snowHis horse, of all Nisaea's breed the choice,Caparison'd in rubies, champs the gold,Which rules his mouth; his animated maneFloats o'er the bridle, form'd of golden braid.His page was nigh, that youth of eastern race,Whom for his merit pure Melissa gaveTo this benignant satrap. To ascendHis gorgeous seat preparing, thus the chief:If I return a conqueror this day,To that excelling dame who made thee mine,Who hath enlarg'd whate'er of wise and great,Of just and temp'rate I to nature owe,Refin'd my manners, and my purest thoughtsExalted, I my friendship will prolong
In gratitude and rev'rence; blessing heav'n,Which thus prefers Masistius to extendBenevolence to virtue. If I fall,Resume with her the happiest lot my careCan recommend, Statirus. Though no Greek,Her pupil, say, in offices humaneHath not been tardy; by her light inspir'd,He went more perfect to a noble grave.End of the Twenty-third Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the TWENTY-FOURTH.WHILE thus Mafistius for the field prepar'd,At sacrifice amidst the diff'rent chiefsPausanias stood, the entrails to consultFor heav'n's direction. Like a god rever'dAmong the Spartans, was an augur fam'd,Tisamenus. The Pythian had declar'dHim first of prophets; he the rites performs;The victim open'd he inspects, and thusIn solemn tone: Hear, Grecians, and obeyThe will of Jove. To pass th' Asopian flood
Forbear. With Persian fetters in her handIll fortune seated on that bank I see,On this the laurel'd figure of success.The augur ceas'd; when suddenly in viewTh' Asopian current, overswelling, foamsWith eastern squadrons, wading through the fords.Bounds in the van Masistius on a steed,Whose glist'ning hue the brightest of the fourWhich drew th' irradiate axle of the mornMight scarce outshine. Erect the hero sat,Firm as the son of Danaë by Jove,When his strong pinion'd Pegasus he wheel'dThrough Aethiopian air from death to guardAndromeda his love. In rapid hasteA herald greets Pausanias: From the menOf Megara I come. A post advanc'd,The most obnoxious in the Grecian lineTo harassing assaults, their daily toil
With unabating firmness long has held.Unwonted numbers of Barbarian horseNow sweep the field; a reinforcement send,Her standard else will Megara withdraw.Pausanias then, alike to try the Greeks,And save his Spartans, answer'd: Chiefs, you hear;Who will be foremost to sustain our friends?Through fear the dang'rous service is declin'dBy many. Indignation to beholdNo Spartans offer'd, but the arduous taskImpos'd on others, held Cleander mute;When Aristides: Herald, swift return,Athenian aid might else prevent thy speed.The patriot spake, and left the Greeks amaz'd,Well knowing Athens with abhorrence look'd
On Megara, her envious, ranc'rous foeOf ancient date, whom now she flies to aid.Meantime that feeblest station of the campTh' impetuous Asian cavalry surround.As clouds, impregnated with hail, dischargeTheir stormy burden on a champaign richIn ripen'd grain, and lay the crackling rowsOf Ceres prostrate; under sheets of darts,With arrows barb'd and javelins, thus whole ranksOf Megara, by wounds or death o'erthrown,Gasp on the ground. Alcathöus expires,The blood of Nisus, Megatensian princeIn times remote, and fabled to have heldHis fate dependent on a purple hairAmidst his hoary locks. That vital threadHis impious daughter sever'd, blind with loveFor Minos, Cretan king, her father's foe.Masistius pierc'd him; javelins from his arm
Incessant flew; on heaps of nameless deadHe laid Evenus, Lysicles, the youthOf Cyparissus, and Cratander's age,Distinguish'd each by office, wealth, or birth,Or martial actions. Beasts of chace and prey,The wolf and boar, the lion and the stag,Within close toils imprison'd, thus becomeThe hunter's mark. The signal of retreatIs now uplifted by the hopeless chiefs;When, as a friendly gale with stiff'ning wingsRepels a vessel, driving by the forceOf boist'rous currents in a fatal trackTo bulge on rocks, a voluntary bandOf men at arms, and bowmen, Attic all,Restrain the flight of Megara. ExpertTheir shafts they level at the Persian steeds,Not at the riders. Soon around the plainTh' ungovern'd animals disperse, enrag'dBy galling wounds. Olympiodorus, chief
Among the light auxiliars, on the listsOf Pisa just Hellanodics had crown'd,The first of Greeks in archery. He standsLike Telamonian Teucer on the moundOf Atreus' son, where fate's unerring handHad strung the bow which heap'd with Phrygian deadTh' empurpled fosse, while Ajax swung abroadThe sev'n-fold shield to guard a brother's skill.Still in the field Masistius, who observ'dThe active archer, from his lofty seatAgainst him whirls a javelin. Cimon nearReceives the blunted weapon on the bossOf his huge buckler. His vindictive bowOlympiodorus bends; the rapid shaftFull in the forehead of the gen'rous steedHe lodges deep. The high Nisaean bloodBoils in its channels through tormenting pain;Erect the courser paws in air, and hurls
In writhing agitation from his backTh' illustrious rider on the plain supine.Against him rush th' Athenians; on his feetThey find him brandishing his sabre keen,With his firm shield a bulwark to his breast,Like one of those earth-sprung in radiant arms,Whom the Cadmēan dragon's fruitful jawsOr Colchian serpent's teeth produc'd. Assail'dOn ev'ry side, his fortitude augmentsWith danger. Down to Pluto's realm he sendsIphicrates and Eurytus, who drankCallirrhoe's fountain; Amynander bornOn smooth Ilissus, and three gallant youthsOf Marathon. His cuirass strong withstandsRepeated blows; unwounded, but o'ercomeBy unremitted labour, on his knees,Like some proud structure half o'erthrown by time,He sinks at last. Brave Cimon hastes to saveA foe so noble in his deeds, in port
Beyond a mortal; when a vulgar swordThat moment through the vizor of his helmTransfix'd the brain, so exquisitely form'd,The seat of purest sentiment and thought.His frame, in ruin beauteous still and great,The fatal stroke laid low. An earthquake thusShook from his base that wonder of the world,The Colossean deity of Rhodes.Of danger all unheeding, by his lordStatirus kneel'd, and o'er his bosom spreadHis palms in anguish. Timely to protectThe gentle youth ingenuous Cimon came,While thus the gasping satrap breath'd his last:Farewell, thou faithful—Bid Mardonius thinkHow brief are life's enjoyments—Virtue livesThrough all eternity—By virtue earn'd,Praise too is long—Melissa—grant me thine.In death, resembling sweetest sleep, his eyesSerenely drop their curtains, and the soulFlies to th' eternal mansions of the just.Within the trenches Cimon straight commandsTo lodge the corse; when lo! another cloudOf Eastern squadrons, Mindarus their chief,Who, o'er the stream detach'd with numbers new,Not finding great Masistius, rous'd afreshThe storm of onset. Dreadful was the shockOf these, attempting to redeem, of those,Who held the body; but the Attic spearsBreak in the chests of fiery steeds, which pressWith violence unyielding, and the ranksIn front disarm. The archers have discharg'dTheir quivers. Now had Mindarus acquir'dUndying glory, and the Greeks resign'dThe long-contested prize, when threat'ning shouts,Of diff'rent Grecians, pouring from the camp,Alarm the eastern chief. Cleander here
With all Troezenè, Arimnestus there,Diomedon's bold successor in arms,With his Plataeans, and the Thespian brave,Alcimedon, assail the Persian flanks.So two hoarse torrents opposite descendFrom hills, where recent thunder-storms have burst;In the mid-vale the dashing waters meetTo overwhelm the peasant's hopes and toil.Myronides and Aeschylus in sight,Each with his formidable phalanx moves;Th' encampment whole is arming. From the fightHis mangled cavalry the Persian calls.In eager quest of refuge in their linesBeyond Asopus, through surrounding foesThe coursers vault like swimmers, who forsakeA found'ring vessel, and with buoyant strengthBound through the surge for safety on the beach.Triumphant in their camp the Greeks replaceTheir standards; thither Cimon's gen'rous care
Transports Masistius. Eager to beholdA prize so noble, curious throngs on throngsPress in disorder; each his station leaves;Confusion reigns. The gen'ral host to armsPausanias sternly vigilant commands,And next provides a chariot to display,Throughout th' extensive lines, th' illustrious dead,In magnitude and beauty late the prideOf nature's study'd workmanship. His limbsThe hand of Cimon tenderly compos'd,As would a brother to a brother's corse.Masistius fill'd the chariot; on his kneesStatirus held, and water'd with his tearsThe face majestic, not by death deform'd,Pale, but with features mild, which still retain'dAttractive sweetness to endear the sight.First on the right through Lacedaemon's rangeThe spectacle is carried; silence there
Prevails; the Spartan citizen no signOf triumph shews, subordinate to law,Which disciplin'd his passions. Tow'rds the left,Through exultation loud of other Greeks,The awful car at length to Attic ranksBrings their own prize, by Aristides met;There silence too, in rev'rence of their chief,Is universal. He prepares to speak;But first the mighty reliques he surveys.He feels like Jove, contemplating the pure,The gen'rous, brave Sarpedon, as he layIn death's cold arms, when swift th' almighty sireDecreed that Morpheus, gentlest of the gods,Should waft to Lycia's realm the royal clay,From pious friends and subjects to obtainThe rites of splendid sepulture. CompleteWas now the solemn pause; to list'ning earsThus Aristides vents his godlike soul:Here close your triumph, Grecians, nor provokeThe jealous pow'rs who mark for chosen wrathO'er-weening pride. Though auguring successFrom this great satrap's fall, revere his clay;Such rev'rence all of mortal mold will need,All soon, or late. If comeliness and strength,If gracious manners, and a mind humane,If worth and wisdom could avoid the grave,You had not seen this tow'r of Asia fall.Yet there is left attainable by man,What may survive the grave; it is the fameOf gen'rous actions; this do you attain.I in Psittalia's isle this Persian knewBrave Medon's prize; his captive hands we freed;To him our hospitable faith we pledg'd,Through whom Phoebean Timon was redeem'd,With Haliartus, on Euboea's fieldsTo signalize their swords. On Oeta's hillIn him the daughter of Oïleus found
A spotless guardian. Let his corse and arms,Thy acquisition, Cimon, be resign'dTo piety; a herald shall attendThy steps; remove him to his native friends.Let Xerxes hear, let fierce Mardonius see,How much Barbarians differ from the Greeks.Minerva's tribes, approving, hear the wordsOf clemency and pity. Cimon mountsThe fun'ral car; attentive and compos'dLike Maia's son, commission'd from the skiesBy his eternal sire, the warrior hearsThe full instructions of his patron chief.Th' Asopian stream he fords to Asia's tents,Whence issue wailing multitudes, who rendThe air with ejulation, while the wheelsBefore Mardonius stop their solemn roll.He rives his mantle, and defiles with dustHis splendid head. Not more the destin'd king
Of Judah mourn'd the virtuous heir of Saul,Mow'd down in battle by Philistian strengthOn Gilboa's heights; nor melted more in griefO'er Absalom's fair locks, too much endear'dTo blind parental fondness. From the carDescending, Cimon spake: Lo! Persian chief,The just Athenian, Aristides, sendsThese reliques, which he honours, to partakeOf sepulture, as eastern rites ordain.Then art thou fall'n, too confident, exclaimsMardonius, too unmindful of my love,And anxious warnings! Mithra, veil thy faceIn clouds! In tears of blood, thou sky, dissolve!Earth groan, and gen'ral nature join in woe!The tallest cedar of the orient grovesLies prostrate—Destiny malign! I braveThy further malice—Blasted to the rootIs all my joy. Here sorrow clos'd his lips.
As frozen dead by wintry gusts he stood,Devoid of motion; Mindarus was nigh,Whose interposing prudence thus was heard:O chief of nations numberless! who standSpectators round, and watch thy lightest look,Confine thy anguish; in their sight revereThyself; regard this messenger benignFrom Aristides, and thy native senseOf obligation rouse. Mardonius then,As from a trance: I hear thee, and approve,My gentle kinsman. This returning car,With purest gold, and costly vesture pil'd,Shall bear the copious tribute of my thanksTo Aristides; whom extoll'd to heav'nBy excellent Masistius oft my soulHath heard, the righteous by the righteous prais'd.Now Cimon interpos'd: That man extoll'dThou dost not, Persian, lib'ral as thou art,
Mean to offend; thy presents then with-hold.In poverty more glorious, than in wealthThe wealthiest, Aristides frowns at gold.No costly vestures decorate his frame,Itself divine; the very arms he wears,The sole possession of that spotless man,All ornament reject; he only boastsThe sharpest sword, the weightiest spear and shield.Ha! must I pass unthankful in the sightOf one, Masistius lov'd, the chief reply'd?No, answer'd quick th' Athenian; from his crossTake down Leonidas. A stedfast lookMardonius fix'd on Cimon: That request,O Greek! is big with danger to my head,Which I will hazard, since the only priceSet on the precious reliques thou restor'st.This said, he orders to his tent the corse;There on the clay-cold bosom of his friendThus plaintive hangs: Fall'n pillar of my hopes,What is Mardonius, wanting thy support!Thou arm of strength, for ever are unbrac'dThy nerves! Enlighten'd mind, where prudence dwelt,Heart purify'd by honour, you have leftMardonius helpless; left him to himself,To his own passions, which thy counsel tam'd!The dang'rous paths of error I shall treadWithout thy guidance! Shame, defeat and death,Frown in thy wounds ill-boding—yet thy lookNot fate itself of gentleness deprives.By heaven a world shall mourn thee—Loud he calls;Which Mindarus obeys. To him the chief:Thou too didst love Masistius—Fly, proclaimA gen'ral lamentation through the camp;
Let all Boeotia sound Masistius lost.O verify'd too clearly, boding dreamOf mine, by him so fatally despis'd!See ev'ry head dismantled of its hair,The soldiers, women, eunuchs; of his maneSee ev'ry steed, the mule and camel shorn.O that the echo of our grief might passThe Hellespont to Asia! that her lossThrough all her cities, through her vales, and streams,Beyond the banks of Ganges might be told!As Mindarus departs, the Theban chiefApproaches, Leontiades, who spake:If there be one, O gen'ral, can replaceMasistius wise, that prodigy is found,Elēan Hegesistratus, of seersThe most renown'd. His penetrating mindCan from the victim slain, or mystic flight
Of birds, foresee the dark events of time;Invet'rate foe to Sparta, sore with wrongs,He comes thy servant. Opportune he comes,Replies Mardonius. In the rites of GreeceTen hecatombs, before the sun descends,Shall to Masistius bleed an off'ring high.I will engage this augur at a priceBeyond his wishes; let his skill decide,When to give battle, and avenge my friend.Collect your Grecian artists; instant buildA cenotaph in your Dircaean grove,Where that pure fountain trills a mournful note.There shall Masistius in his name surviveAmong the Greeks; his last remains, embalm'd,Among his fathers shall in Susa rest.The Theban goes. Statirus next appears;Th' afflicted hero greets the weeping youth:Ah! poor Statirus! thou hast lost thy lord,I lost my friend, her bulwark Asia lost.The sacred clay to Artamanes bear,Left in Trachiniae chief. His pious love(Who did not love Masistius) will conveyTo distant Sestos his embalm'd remains,Thence o'er the narrow Hellespont, to reachHis native Asia, and his father's tomb.How did he fall, Statirus? Did he sendTo me no counsel from his dying lips?These, in a sigh the faithful page began,Were his last accents. "Let Mardonius think"How brief are life's enjoyments. Virtue lives"Through all eternity. By virtue earn'd"Praise too is long—Melissa, grant me thine".Commend me to Melissa, starting, spakeThe son of Gobryas. From the shameful cross
Bid Artamanes in her presence freeLeonidas the Spartan. Now performAnother act of duty to thy lord;Despoil my head of all its curling pride;Slight sacrifice to grief—but ev'ry limb,Lopt from this body, and its mangled fleshShall in the dust be scatter'd, ere I quitMy chace of great revenge. Concluding here,He strides impetuous like a stately ram,Lord of the flock new-shorn. His giant guardInclose him round; th' innumerable hostAttend him, all divested of their hair,In howling anguish to an altar huge,By hasty hands constructed. Deep the earthAround is hollow'd, deep is drench'd with blood.Ten hundred sable victims heap the ground.Now gen'ral silence reigns, as o'er the mainIn winter, when Halcyonè laments
Her Ceyx lost, and Aeolus, her sire;By pity soften'd, all the air is calm,While she sits brooding on her watry nest.Amidst a cloud of frankincense the priestOf Elis, Hegesistratus, performsThe rites of divination; awful thusAt length unfolds the mysteries of time:Hear, all ye nations; great Mardonius, hear;Th' Asopïan channel is the line of fate;The host, which passes, falls; success will crownTh' assail'd; th' assailant is to slaughter doom'd.The multitude, discourag'd by the deathOf their belov'd Masistius, hear in joy;Not so Mardonius at revenge delay'd.Inaction aggravates his pain; his tentReceives him. Solitary there, like nightWithin her cavern, thus he feeds his grief:"Ambition curb; let virtue be thy pride."So spake Masistius, when we parted lastTo meet no more—I feel ambition cold,Benumb'd by sorrow—"Let Mardonius think,"How brief are life's enjoyments;" so thy fate,Dear friend, evinces—Life itself is short;Its joys are shorter; yet the scanty spanAdversity can lengthen, till we loathe.If, on the brilliant throne of Xerxes plac'd,I held the orient and Hesperian worldsMy vassals, could the millions in my hostCompel the adamantine gate of deathTo render back my friend? O tortur'd heart!Which burn'st with friendship, of thy gen'rous flameTh' inestimable object is no more.What then is greatness? What th' imperial robe,The diadem and scepter? Could you fillThe void, his endless absence hath produc'dIn my sad bosom? Were ye mine how vain
The acquisition, which my grief would loathe,And, wak'd by grief, let honour timely shun,Lest from his grave Masistius should ariseTo shake my pillow with his nightly curse.Not hecatombs on hecatombs of bullsHeap'd on his manes, not the votive hair,Nor fun'ral moan of nations could availTo moderate his ire; nor all the pow'rOf empires join'd to empires guard my sleep.At length he sinks in slumber, not compos'd,But wanders restless through the wild of dreams.End of the Twenty-fourth Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the TWENTY-FIFTH.ERE thus each augur in the diff'rent campsUnmann'd the soldier by religious dread,Euboea's coast Sicinus had regain'd.That peopled island's force of ships and armsThemistocles had muster'd. Oreus heldThe ready chief, expecting weighty newsFrom Aristides, which Sicinus swiftImparts. To him Themistocles: My friend,I ask no more; the assembled host of GreeceHath fix'd Mardonius on th' Asopian verge;
A hasty conflict Aristides shuns;Then shall the blow, I meditate, be struck,Ere thy reverted passage can transmitTo him my greetings. Stay and see my oarsFor infamous Thessalia dash the waves;Her Aleuadian race of tyrants foul,Friends to Barbarians, traitors to the Greeks,Shall feel my scourge. Her plenty I will barAgainst Mardonius; famine shall invadeHis tents, and force him to unequal fight.He gives command; the signal is uprear'dFor embarkation. All Euboea poursHer sons aboard, and loads the groaning decks.From his Cleora Hyacinthus parts,Brave Haliartus from his new-espous'dAcanthè. Lo! each female seeks the beach,Spectatress eager of th' alluring man,Whose artful eye could summon ev'ry grace
To fascinate both sexes, and his wilesArm with enchantment. Beauteous and augustLike Cybelè, prime goddess, turret-crown'd,Source of th' ethereal race, his consort liftsAbove the rest her countenance sublime.By her own offspring, and the pledges dearOf Aristides, which her hand receiv'dAt Salamis, and cherish'd like her own,She stands encircled, her embarking lordAccosting thus: Unfavourable winds,Or fortune's frown I fear not. All the godsOf earth and ocean, who delighted viewThe virtuous brave, contending for their lawsWith lawless tyrants, will combine to blessThemistocles and Aristides link'dIn harmony of counsels. See, dear lord,His and thy children interweave their hands;Thy sure success I augur from their smiles.I from Timothea's, gallantly repliesThe parting chief. This union is thy work;Thine be the praise from thankful Greece preserv'd.He said, and lightly to his vessel pass'd;While ev'ry sail was op'ning to the wind.Euboea, where she fronts the Malian shore,Beneath a promontory's quiet leeProtects the fleet benighted. Here the sonOf Neocles aboard his galley callsHis pupil Hyacinthus, whom he thusInstructs: Young hero, since Cleora's loveCould not detain thee from the lists of fame,Fame thou shalt win. Thessalia's nearest boundsI from Spercheos in Trachiniae's bayMean to invade. Nicanor and thyselfWith your Carystian force, Nearchus braveWith his Chalcidians, must a distant course
To Potidaea take, whose valiant raceThe winter siege of great Masistius foil'd.Forewarn'd by due intelligence from me,They will augment your numbers. Through the mouthOf fam'd Enipeus Potidaean zealWill guide your helms to rich Larissa's walls,Thessalia's helpless capital, whose youthAttend Mardonius. Land, and burn th' abodeOf Aleuadian Thorax, who conductsThe foe through Greece. O'er all the region spread;Where'er thou seest an Aleuadian roof,The residence of traitors hurl to earth;The flocks and herds from ev'ry pasture sweep,From ev'ry store th' accumulated grain,Support of Asia's myriads. O! recallThy late achievements on the bloody fieldsOf Chalcis, and of Oreus. They, who brav'dThy native coast, of Demonax the friends,
Now in their own Thessalia lie thy spoil;On their wide ruins build thee trophies new.Commission'd thus, the animated youthWith each Carystian, each Chalcidic prow,By morning sails. Three days the Attic chief,Skreen'd in a harbour nigh Cenaeum's point,Rests on his anchors. So, by thickets hidIn fell Hyrcania, nurse of rav'nous broods,The tiger lurks, and meditates unseenA sudden sally on his heedless prey.The fourth gay dawn with fresh'ning breezes curlsThe Malian waters. In Barbaric flagsThe wily chief apparelling his mastsFallacious, ere the horizontal sunCouch'd on the ocean, fills with hostile prowsThe wide Sperchean mouth. Along the vales
Innumerable carriages displayThe plenty huge for Asia's camp amass'd.Th' encircling mountains all their echoes blendIn one continu'd sound with bleating flocks,With bellowing herds, and dissonant uproarOf their conductors; whom Thessalia sent,Whom all the extent of Thracia, and the realmOf Amarantha's lord. Th' affrighted hindsDesert their charge. Trachiniae's neighb'ring gatesWith fugitives are throng'd. Lo! Cleon plantsHis bold Eretrian banners on the strand;The Styrians form; Eudemus bounds ashore,Geraestians follow; then auxiliars new,The subjects late of Demonax; the troopsOf Locrian Medon, Delphian Timon land,Themistocles the last; whose chosen guardOf fifty Attic, fifty Spartan youths,Still sedulous and faithful close the rear.They reach'd in order'd march Trachinian walls,Whose gates unclos'd. Majestical advanc'dA form rever'd by universal Greece,Prais'd by each tongue, by ev'ry eye admir'd,The Oïlean priestess of th' immortal Nine,The goddess-like Melissa. Medon swift,With Haliartus, met her sacred step.Her name divulg'd from ev'ry station call'dThe gazing chiefs, Themistocles the first;Whom, by her brother pointed out to view,She thus address'd: Themistocles, give ear,And thou, O Medon, whom, a stranger longTo my desiring eyes, they see restor'd.Well may you wonder, that a hostile fortMelissa's hand delivers to your pow'r.There is a Persian worthy to be rank'dAmong the first of Grecians. Just, humane,Thy captive, Medon, amply hath discharg'dHis price of ransom. Nine revolving moons
Beheld Masistius guardian of my hillIn purity of rev'rence to my fane,My person, my dependents. I forsookAt Amarantha's suit my old abode;A virtuous princess from a sickly couchMy care hath rais'd, Sandaucè, in those wallsLong resident with me. Two days are pastSince Artamanes, governing these tracts,Heard of a navy on Thessalia's coast,And with his force, though slender, took the fieldTo guard Larissa. Your descent unmansThe few remaining Persians in the fort;All with Saudaucè and her children flewTo my protection; mercy to obtainBecame my charge; her terrors will disperse,Soon as she knows, Themistocles is nigh.The army halts. Trachiniae's gates admitCecropia's hero, Medon, and the son
Of Lygdamis. Sandaucè they approach,Sandaucè late in convalescent charmsFresh, as a May-blown rose, by pallid fearNow languid, as a lily beat with rain,Till she discovers with transported looksHer Salaminian guardian; then the warmthOf gratitude, redoubling all her bloom,Before him throws her prostrate. To him ranThe recollecting children, who embraceTheir benefactor's knees. She thus unfoldsHer lips, whose tuneful exclamation charms:O, my protector—Interposing swift,His ready hand uplifts her from the ground.Do not disgrace me, thou excelling fair,He said; to leave such beauty thus depress'dWould derogate from manhood. She replies:Forbear to think my present captive lotHath humbled thus Sandaucè. No, the weightOf obligation past, my rescu'd babesIn Salamis, myself from horror sav'd,Have bent my thankful knee. No fears debaseMy bosom now; Themistocles I see,In him a known preserver. Melting by,Melissa, Medon, Haliartus, shedThe tend'rest dews of sympathy. In lookCompassionate, but calm, the chief rejoins:Suggest thy wishes, princess, and commandMy full compliance. She these accents sighs:Ye gen'rous men, what pity is not dueTo eastern women! Prize, ye Grecian dames,Your envy'd state. When your intrepid lordsIn arms contend with danger on the plain,You in domestic peace are left behind
Among your letter'd progeny, to formTheir ductile minds, and exercise your skillIn arts of elegance and use. Alas!Our wretched race, in ignorance and slothBy Asia nurtur'd, like a captive train,In wheeling dungeons with our infants clos'd,Must wait th' event of some tremendous hour,Which, unpropitious, leaves us on the fieldA spoil of war. What myriads of my sexFrom Greece to distant Hellespont bestrewThe ways, and whiten with their bleaching bonesThe Thracian wilds! Spercheos views the tombOf Ariana, hapless sister, laidIn foreign mold! My portion of distressYou know, benignant guardians, who asswag'dMy suff'rings. Then to quit the diresul scene,Revisiting my native soil, to restAmong my children, and instruct their youth,As kind Melissa hath instructed mine,
Were sure no wish immoderate or vague.But Artamanes—Blushing, trembling, hereShe paus'd. Melissa takes the word: Sweet friend,Let vice, not virtue blush. Cecropian chief,Her soft attention well that youth deserves,She all his constancy and care. Their handsAre pledg'd; th' assent of Asia's king aloneIs wanting, which Mardonius hath assur'dTo Artamanes, flow'r of Asia's peers.Him, with unequal force, to battle march'dAgainst thy ranks, which never have been foil'd,She knows, and trembles. Artfully repliesThemistocles: Sandaucè may preventThis danger. Let her messenger conveyA kind injunction, that the noble youth,Whose merit I have treasur'd in my breast,May sheath his fruitless weapons, and, return'dTo her, aboard my well-appointed keelWith her embarking, seek their native soil.The princess hears, and joyfully providesA messenger of trust. Assembling nowHis captains, thus Themistocles ordains:Friends of Euboea, soon as Phoebus dawnsYour progress bend to Larissaean tow'rs;Your chief is Cleon. Hyacinthus join;To your united force the foe must yield.Save Artamanes; bring him captive back,But not with less humanity than care.Accomplish'd Medon, Haliartus, vers'dIn Oeta's neighb'ring wilds, your Locrians plantAmong the passes; once secur'd, they leaveUs at our leisure to contrive and act.Thee, honour'd seer of Delphi, at my sideIn this Trachinian station I retain.By op'ning day each leader on his chargeProceeds. Themistocles inspects the vale,
Constrains the peasants from unnumber'd carsAboard his fleet to lade the golden grain.Before Thermopylae the Locrian filesAppear. From Oeta's topmast peak, behold,O'er Medon's head a vulture wings his flight,Whom to a cross beside the public wayTh' Oïlean hero's curious eye pursues.Oh! stay thy rav'nous beak, in anguish loudCries Haliartus. Shudder while thou hear'st,Son of Oïleus; on that hideous pileThe bones of great Leonidas are hung.Then Medon's cool, delib'rate mind was shookBy agitation to his nature strange.His spear and buckler to the ground he hurl'd;Before th' illustrious ruins on his kneeHe sunk, and thus in agony exclaim'd:Should this flagitious profanation passUnpunish'd still, th' existence of the godsWere but a dream. O, long-enduring Jove!Thy own Herculean offspring canst thou seeDefac'd by vultures, and the parching wind,Yet wield resistless thunder—But thy waysAre awfully mysterious; to arraignThy heaviest doom is blasphemy. Thy willFor me reserv'd the merit to redeemThese precious reliques; penitent I ownMy rashness; thankful I accept the task.O mighty spirit! who didst late informWith ev'ry virtue that disfigur'd frame,With ev'ry kind affection prov'd by me,The last distinguish'd object of thy care,When it forbad me to partake thy fate,The life, thy friendship sav'd, I here devoteTo vindicate thy manes. Not the wrongs
Of gen'ral Greece, not Locris giv'n to flames,Not the subversion of my father's house,E'er with such keen resentment stung my heart,As this indignity to thee. He said,And, with the aid of Haliartus, free'dThe sacred bones; Leonteus, and the primeOf Locris, frame with substituted shieldsTh' extemporeanous bier. Again the chief:Leonteus, Haliartus, rest behind;Achieve th' important service, which the sonOf Neocles enjoins. The pious chargeBe mine of rend'ring to Melissa's careThese honour'd reliques. Now in measur'd paceThe warlike bearers tread; their manly breastsNot long withhold the tribute of their sighsIngenuous; tears accompany their steps.His sister in Trachiniae Medon soonApproaches; glad she hears him, and replies.Hail! brother, hail! thou chosen by the godsFrom longer shame to rescue these remains,Which once contain'd whate'er is good and greatAmong the sons of men. Majestic shade!By unrelenting laws of Dis forbidTo enter, where thy ancestors reside;Who, seed of Jove, to their Elysian joysExpect thee, most illustrious of the race.Amidst thy wand'rings on the banks of Styx,Dost thou recall Melissa's dirge of praiseO'er thee, preparing by a glorious deathTo save thy country? O! unbury'd still,Did not Melissa promise to thy dustPeace in her temple? An atrocious kingHath barr'd awhile th' accomplishment; thy friend,Thy soldier, now will ratify my word.Soon to Lycurgus shall thy spirit pass,To Orpheus, Homer, and th' Ascraean sage,Who shall contend to praise thee in their bow'rs
Of amaranth and myrtle, ever youngLike thy renown. In Oeta's fane these bones,Dear to the Muses, shall repose, till Greece,Amid her future triumphs, hath decreedA tomb and temple to her saviour's fame.This high oblation of pathetic praise,Paid by her holy friend, Sandaucè notesAttentive; seldom from Melissa's eyeWas she remote. Her eunuchs she deputesTo bring a coffer large of od'rous woodInlaid with pearl, repository dueTo such divine remains. In time appearsTh' Athenian gen'ral to applaud the deed,While thus the mighty manes he invokes:Hear, thou preserver of thy country, hear!Lo! in his palms of Salamis the sonOf Neocles salutes thee. From a hand,
Which hath already half aveng'd thy death,Accept of decent rites. Thy virtue sav'dA nation; they hereafter shall completeThy fun'ral honours, and surround thy tombWith trophies equal to thy deathless name.He ceas'd. Her mantle on the solemn sceneNight from her car in dusky folds outspread.Three mornings pass. Anon Sperchēan banksRe-echo shouts of triumph, while the valesAre clad in arms. Lo! Cleon is return'd,Uplifting bloodless ensigns of success,And thus accosts Themistocles: Thy prize,This Persian lord receive; our hasty marchO'ertook his rear. From Larissaean tow'rs,A recent conquest, Hyacinthus, join'dBy Potidaeans, and Olynthian spears,Was then in sight. The herald I detach'd
With fair Sandaucè's message, and thy termsOf peace and safety; Artamanes foundResistance vain, and yielded. From the vanNow stepp'd the Persian graceful, and bespakeThemistocles: Accept a second timeThy captive, gen'rous Grecian; nor imputeTo want of prowess, or to fond excessOf acquiescence to Sandaucè's will,My unreserv'd surrender. To have stain'dBy fruitless contest thy triumphant wreathsWith blood, and spurn'd the bounty of thy hand,Had prov'd ingratitude in me. These wordsCecropia's chief return'd: Receive my hand,Thy pledge of freedom here not less secure,Than heretofore at Salamis, thy pledgeOf bliss yet more endearing. Soon my keelShall place thee happy on thy native coast,Thee and thy princess; that in future days
You may at least of all the Asian breedReport my kindness, and forget my sword.Amidst his words a soft complaining trillOf Philomela interrupts their sound.The youthful satrap then: That pensive bird,Sandaucè's warbling summoner, is wontIn evening shade on Ariana's tombTo sit and sing; my princess there devotesIn melancholy solitude this hourTo meditation, which dissolves in tears.Then greet her, said th' Athenian; thy returnWill sooth her tender breast. My promise add,That on the first fair whisper of the winds,She shall revisit her maternal soil.This said, they parted. At her sister's graveThe satrap join'd his princess. He began:I have obey'd thy summons. No disgraceWas my surrender to the conqu'ring sword,Which Persia long hath felt. Thy servant comesNo more a captive, but to thee by choice;Themistocles all bounteous and humane,As heretofore, I find. Forbear to checkThat rising birth of smiles; in perfect lightThose half-illuminated eyes attire;Enough the tribute of their tears hath lav'dThese precious tombs. Prepare thee to embark;Themistocles hath promis'd thou shalt leaveA land, whose soaring genius hath depress'dThe languid plumes of Asia. Lift thy headIn pleasing hope to clasp thy mother's knees,To change thy weeds of mourning, and receiveA royal brother's gift, this faithful hand.Nigh Ariana's clay Autarctus slept.Divine Sandaucè on her husband's tomb,
With marble pomp constructed by the careOf Artamanes, fix'd a pensive lookIn silence. Sudden from the cluster'd shrubs,O'erhanging round it, tuneful all and blitheA flight of feather'd warblers, which aboundThrough each Thessalian vale, in carrol sweetPerch on the awful monument. The sunStreaks with a parting, but unsully'd rayTheir lively change of plumage, and each rillIs soften'd by their melody. Accept,Accept this omen, Artamanes cries;Autarctus favours, Horomazes smiles,Whose choir of songsters not unprompted seemOur nuptial hymn preluding. She replies:I want no omen to confirm thy truth.Dust of my sister, of my lord, farewell;Secure in Grecian piety remain.Still in his offspring will Sandaucè loveI have obey'd thy summons.

That husband, thou, my Artamanes, stillRevere that friend. She said, and dropp'd her hand,Press'd by the youth. With purity their guide,They o'er the mead Sperchēan slowly seekTrachinian portals. Phoebe on their headsLets fall a spotless canopy of light.End of the Twenty-fifth Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the TWENTY-SIXTH.FROM her Tithonian couch Aurora mountsThe sky. In rev'rence now of Sparta's name,Yet more of dead Leonidas, three daysTo preparation for his burial ritesThemistocles decrees. To curious searchInnumerable herds and flocks supplySelected victims. Of their hairy pinesTo frame the stately pyre the hills are shorn.Amid this labour Hyacinthus, richIn Aleuadian spoil, his colleague brave
Nicanor, all the Potidaean bands,Th' Olynthians, and Nearchus, who conductsThe youth of Chalcis, reinforce the campWith their victorious ranks. Th' appointed dayWas then arriv'd. A broad constructed pyreTow'rs in the center of Trachiniae's plain;The diff'rent standards of the Grecian hostAre planted round. The Attic chief convenesThe fifty Spartans of his guard, and thus:Themistocles, distinguish'd by your state,By your assiduous courage long sustain'd,Will now repay these benefits. Your king,Leonidas, the brightest star of Greece,No more shall wander in the gloom of Styx;But that last passage to immortal seatsThrough me obtain. Greek institutes requireThe nearest kindred on the fun'ral stageThe dead to lay, the victims to dispose,
To pour libations, and the sacred dustInurn. Alone of these assembled GreeksAre you the hero's countrymen; aloneYour hands the pious office shall discharge.Th' obedient Spartans from Trachiniae's gatesProduce to view the venerable bonesHerculean. Lifted up the structure highOf pines and cedars, on the surface largeAll, which of great Leonidas remains,By sedulous devotion is compos'd.The various captains follow, some in gazeOf wonder, others weeping. Last appearsMelissa, trailing her pontific pall(Calliopè in semblance) with her troopOf snowy-vested nymphs from Oeta's hill,With all her vassals, decently arrang'dBy Mycon's care. Two hecatombs are slain,Of sheep five hundred, and libations pour'd
Of richest wine. A Spartan now appliesThe ruddy firebrand. In his priestly robePhoebean Timon supplicates a breezeFrom Aeolus to raise the creeping flame.Thrice round the crackling heaps the silent host,With shields revers'd, and spears inclining low,Their solemn movement wind. The shrinking pyreNow glows in embers; fresh libations dampThe heat. A vase of silver high-emboss'd,By Hyacinthus from Larissa brought,Spoil of th' abode which treach'rous Thorax held,Receives the sacred ashes, and is plac'dBefore Melissa. So the godlike sonOf Neocles directs. An awful signFrom her commands attention; thus she spake:Thou art not dead, Leonidas; thy mindIn ev'ry Grecian lives. Thy mortal part,Transform'd to ashes, shall on Oeta's hill
Among the celebrating Muses dwellIn glory; while through animated GreeceThy virtue's inextinguishable firesPropitious beam, and, like the flames of Jove,Intimidate her foes. Not wine, nor oil,Nor blood of hecatombs, profusely spilt,Can to thy manes pay the tribute due;The massacre of nations, all the spoilOf humbled Asia, Destiny hath mark'dFor consecration of thy future tomb.Two ministers my soul prophetic sees,Themistocles and Aristides standPresiding o'er the sacrifice. The earth,The sea, shall witness to the mighty rites.Cease to regret the transitory doomOf thy remains insulted, no disgraceTo thee, but Xerxes. Pass, exalted shade,The bounds of Dis, nor longer wail thy termOf wand'ring now elaps'd; all measur'd time
Is nothing to eternity. AssumeAmong the bless'd thy everlasting seat.Th' indignity, thy earthly frame endur'd,Perhaps the gods permitted in their loveTo sill the measure of celestial wrathAgainst thy country's foes; then rest in peace,Thou twice illustrious victim to her weal.As, when Minerva in th' Olympian hallAmid the synod of celestials pour'dHer eloquence and wisdom, ev'ry godIn silence heard, and Jove himself approv'd;Around Melissa thus were seen the chiessIn admiration bound; o'er all supremeThemistocles applauded. Mycon last,With her injunction charg'd, to Oeta's shrineWas now transporting in their polish'd urnThe treasur'd ashes, when along the plainA sudden, new appearance strikes the sight,
A fun'ral car, attended by a troopOf olive-bearing mourners. They approachMelissa; suppliant in her view exposeEmbalm'd Masistius. Sent from Asia's camp,A passage these had recently obtain'dFrom good Leonteus, by his brother plac'dThermopylae's sure guard. Melissa knewThe page Statirus, foremost of the train,Who at her feet in agony began:Thy late protector, cold in death's embrace,Survey, thou holy paragon; his fallAsopus saw. Before the hero climb'dHis fatal steed, to me this charge he gave."If I return a conqueror this day,"To that excelling dame who made thee mine,"Who hath enlarg'd whate'er of wise and great,"Of just and temp'rate I to nature owe,
"Refin'd my manners, and my purest thoughts"Exalted, I my friendship will prolong"In gratitude and rev'rence; blessing heav'n,"Which thus prefers Masistius to extend"Benevolence to virtue. If I fall,"Resume with her the happiest lot my care"Can recommend, Statirus. Though no Greek,"Her pupil, say, in offices humane"Hath not been tardy; by her light inspir'd,"He went more perfect to a noble grave."Cast from his wounded courser, he, o'erpow'r'dBy numbers, died. The body was restor'dBy Aristides, of unrivall'd fameAmong the just and gen'rous. O'er the deadMardonius rent his vesture, and his hair,Then thus ordain'd: "This precious clay embalm'd"To Artamanes bear, whose pious zeal"A friend's remains to Sestus will convey,
"Thence o'er the narrow Hellespont to reach"His native Asia, and his father's tomb."I then repeated what my virtuous lord,Expiring, utter'd: "Let Mardonius think"How brief are life's enjoyments. Virtue lives"Through all eternity. By virtue earn'd"Praise too is long—Melissa, grant me thine"."Commend me to Melissa, starting, spake"The son of Gobryas. From the shameful cross"Bid Artamanes in her presence free"Leonidas the Spartan." All my chargeIs now accomplish'd faithfully to all.Not far was Artamanes. From the trainOf Persians strode a giant stern in look,Who thus address'd the satrap: Prince, beholdBriareus; hither by Mardonius sent,
Guard of this noble body, I appearA witness too of thy disgrace; I seeThese Greeks thy victors. Is th' Athenian chiefAmong the band? Themistocles advanc'd;To whom Briareus: Art thou he, who dar'dMy lord to battle on the plains of Thebes?Where have thy fears confin'd thee till this hourThat I reproach thee with thy promise pledg'd?But this inglorious enterprize on herds,On flocks, and helpless peasants, was more safe,Than to abide Mardonius in the field.I now return. What tidings shall I bearFrom thee, great conqueror of beeves and sheep?Say, I am safe, Themistocles repliesIn calm derision, and the fun'ral rites,Thus at my leisure, to Laconia's kingPerform, while your Mardonius sleeps in Thebes.The spirit of Leonidas, in me
Reviving, shall from Oeta's distant topShake your pavilions on Asopian banks.Yet, in return for his recover'd bones,I, undisputed master of the main,Will waft Masistius to a Persian grave.Thou mayst depart in safety, as thou cam'st.The savage hears, and sullenly retreats;While pious Medon thus accosts the dead:Thou son of honour, to thy promise just,Melissa's brother venerates the clayOf her avow'd protector. Let my carePreserve these reliques where no greedy worm,Nor hand profane, may violate thy form;Till friendly gales transport thee to reposeAmong thy fathers. Through Trachinian gatesHe leads the sable chariot, thence conveysTh' illustrious burden to Melissa's roof;
Statirus aids. The priestess, there apart,Bespake her brother thus: My tend'rest tears,From public notice painfully conceal'd,Shall in thy presence have a lib'ral flow.Thou gav'st me this protector; honour, truth,Humanity, and wisdom like thy own,Were his appendage. Virtue is the sameIn strangers, kindred, enemies and friends.He won my friendship—might in earlier daysHave kindled passion—O! since fate decreedThee from Asopus never to return;If by Melissa's precepts thou inspir'dDidst go more perfect to a noble grave,I bless the hours; and memory shall holdEach moment dear, when, list'ning to my voice,Thou sat'st delighted in the moral strain.Leonidas and thou may pass the floodsOf Styx together; in your happy grovesThink of Melissa. Welcom'd were ye both
By her on earth; her tongue shall never cease,Her lyre be never wanting to resoundThee, pride of Asia, him, the first of Greeks,In blended eulogy of grateful song.She o'er the dead through half the solemn nightA copious web of eloquence unwinds,Explaining how Masistius had consum'dNine lunar cycles in assiduous zealTo guard her fane, her vassals to befriend;How they ador'd his presence; how he wonHer from the temple to Sandaucè's cureAt Amarantha's suit; within his tentHow clemency and justice still abodeTo awe Barbarians; how, departing sad,His last farewell at Oeta's shrine he gaveIn words like these: "Unrivall'd dame, we march"Against thy country—Thou should'st wish our fall.
"If we prevail, be confident in me"Thy safeguard still—But heav'n, perhaps, ordainsThat thou shalt never want Masistius more.She pauses. Now her mental pow'rs sublime,Collected all, this invocation frame.O eleutherian sire! this virtuous light,By thee extinguish'd, proves thy care of Greece.Who of the tribes Barbarian now survivesTo draw thy favour? Gratitude requiresThis pure libation of my tears to laveHim once my guardian; but a guardian new,Thy gift in Medon, elevates at lastMy gratitude to thee. Serene she clos'd,Embrac'd her brother, and retir'd to rest.From Oeta's heights fresh rose the morning breeze.A well-apparell'd galley lay unmoor'd
In readiness to sail. Sandaucè dropsA parting tear on kind Melissa's breast,By whom dismiss'd, Statirus on the corseOf great Masistius waits. The Grecian chiefsead Artamanes to the friendly deck,In olive wreaths, pacific sign, attir'd,Whence he the fervour of his bosom pours:O may this gale with gentleness of breathReplace me joyous in my seat of birth,As I sincere on Horomazes callTo send the dove of peace, whose placid wingThe oriental and Hesperian worldMay feel, composing enmity and thirstOf mutual havoc! that my grateful roofMay then admit Themistocles, and allThose noble Grecians, who sustain'd my head,Their captive thrice. But ah! what founts of bloodWill fate still open to o'erflow the earth!
Yet may your homes inviolate remain,Imparting long the fulness of those joys,Which by your bounty I shall soon possess!He ceas'd. The struggle of Sandauce's heartSuppress'd her voice. And now the naval pipeCollects the rowers. At the signal shrillThey cleave with equal strokes the Malian floods.Meantime a vessel, underneath the leeOf Locris coasting, plies the rapid oarIn sight. She veers, and, lodging in her sailsThe wind transverse, across the haven skims;Till on Sperchēan sands she rests her keel.Themistocles was musing on the turnsOf human fortune, and the jealous eyeOf stern republics, vigilantly bentAgainst successful greatness; yet serene,Prepar'd for ev'ry possible reverse
In his own fortune, he the present thought,Of Persians chang'd from foes to friends, enjoy'd.When lo! Sicinus landed. Swift his lordIn words like these the faithful man approach'd.From Aristides hail! Asopus flows,Still undisturb'd by war, between the hostsInactive. Each the other to assailInflexibly their augurs have forbid.The camp, which Ceres shall the best supply,Will gain the palm. Mardonius then must fightTo our advantage both of time and place,Themistocles replies, and sudden callsThe diff'rent leaders round him. Thus he spake:Euboeans, Delphians, Locrians, you, the chiefsOf Potidaea and Olynthus, hear.The ritual honours to a hero due,Whom none e'er equall'd, incomplete are left;
Them shall the new Aurora see resum'd.At leisure now three days to solemn gamesI dedicate. Amid his num'rous tentsMardonius on Asopus shall be told,While he sits trembling o'er the hostile flood,Of Grecian warriors on the Malian sandsDisporting. You in gymnic lists shall wingThe flying spear, and hurl the massy disk,Brace on the caestus, and impel the carTo celebrate Leonidas in sightOf Oeta, witness to his glorious fate.But fifty vessels deep with laden storesI first detach, that gen'ral Greece may shareIn our superfluous plenty. Want shall wasteMardonian numbers, while profusion flowsRound Aristides. To protect, my friends,Th' important freight, three thousand warlike spearsMust be embark'd. You, leaders, now decide,
Who shall with me Thermopylae maintain,Who join the Grecian camp. First Medon rose:From thy successful banner to departBelieve my feet reluctant. From his crossWhen I deliver'd Lacedaemon's king,My life, a boon his friendship once bestow'd,I then devoted in the face of heav'nTo vindicate his manes. What my joy,If I survive, if perish, what my praiseTo imitate his virtue? Greece demandsIn his behalf a sacrifice like thisFrom me, who, dying, only shall dischargeThe debt I owe him; where so well discharge,As at Asopus in the gen'ral shockOf Greece and Asia? But the hundred spears,Which have so long accompany'd my stepsThrough all their wand'rings, are the only force
My wants require. The rest of Locrian armsShall with Leonteus thy controul obey.Pois'd on his shield, and cas'd in Carian steel,Whence issued lustre like Phoebean rays,Thus Haliartus: Me, in peasant-weeds,Leonidas respected. Though my heartThen by unshaken gratitude was bound,My humble state could only feel, not act.A soldier now, my efforts I must joinWith godlike Medon's, to avenge the wrongsOf Sparta's king. But first the soldier's skill,My recent acquisition, let my armForever lose, if once my heart forgetThe gen'rous chief, whose service try'd my arm,Who made Acanthè mine. My present zealHis manly justice will forbear to chide.The priest of Delphi next: Athenian friend,I have a daughter on Cadmēan plains,
My Amarantha. From no other care,Than to be nearer that excelling child,Would I forsake this memorable spot,Where died the first of Spartans, and a chiefLike thee triumphant celebrates that death.Then Cleon proffer'd his Eretrian band,Eight hundred breathing vengeance on a foe,Who laid their tow'rs in ashes. Lampon nextPresents his Styrians. Brave Nearchus joinsTwelve hundred youths of Chalcis. Tideus lastOf Potidaea twice three hundred shields.Enough, your number is complete, the sonOf Neocles reminds them. Swift embark;The gale invites. Sicinus is your guide.He said, and, moving tow'rds the beach, observesThe embarkation. Each progressive keelHis eye pursues. O'erswelling now in thought,
His own deservings, glory and success,Rush on his soul like torrents, which disturbA limpid fount. Of purity depriv'd,The rill no more in music steals along,But harsh and turbid through its channel foams.What sea, what coast, what region have I pass'dWithout erecting trophies, cries the chiefIn exultation to Sicinus staid?Have I not spar'd the vanquish'd to resoundMy clemency? Ev'n Persians are my friends.These are my warriors. Prosp'rous be your sails,Ye Greeks, enroll'd by me, by me inur'dTo arms and conquest. Under Fortune's wingSpeed, and assist my ancient rival's armTo crush th' invader. Distant I upholdThe Grecian armies; distant I will snatchMy share of laurels on the plains of Thebes.Then come, soft peace, of indolence the nurse,
Not to the son of Neocles. On goldLet rigour look contemptuous; I, return'dTo desert Athens, I, enrich'd with spoilsOf potentates, and kings, will raise her headFrom dust. Superb her structures shall proclaimNo less a marvel, than the matchless birdThe glory of Arabia, when, consum'dIn burning frankincense and myrrh, he shewsHis presence new, and, op'ning to the sunRegenerated gloss of plumage, tow'rs,Himself a species. So shall Athens riseBright from her ashes, mistress sole of Greece.From long Piraean walls her winged pow'rShall awe the Orient, and Hesperian worlds.Me shall th' Olympic festival admitIts spectacle most splendid. . . . Ah! suppressImmod'rate thoughts, Sicinus interrupts,Thou citizen of Athens! Who aspires,Resides not there secure. Forbear to sting
Her ever-wakeful jealousy, nor temptThe woes of exile. For excess of worthWas Aristides banish'd. Be not driv'nTo early trial of thy Persian friends.O! thou transcendent, thou stupendous man,From thy Timothea moderation learn,Which, like the stealing touch of gentle timeO'er canvass, pencil'd by excelling art,Smooths glaring colours, and imparts a graceTo mightiest heroes. Thus their dazzling blazeOf glory soft'ning, softens envy's eye.End of the Twenty-sixth Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the TWENTY-SEVENTH.MEANTIME Briareus to the plains of ThebesPrecipitates his course. Arriv'd, he greetsMardonius. Rumour had already told,What, now confirm'd, o'erwhelms the troubled chief,Confounded like the first anointed kingO'er Israel's tribes, when Philistēan dinOf armies pierc'd his borders, and despairSeduc'd his languid spirit to consultThe sorceress of Endor. Call, he said,Elēan Hegesistratus—Be swift.The summon'd augur comes. To him the sonOf Gobryas: Foe to Sparta, heed my words;Themistocles possesses on our backsTh' Oetaean passes. Famine, like a beast,Noos'd and subservient to that fraudful man,Who shuns the promis'd contest in the field,He can turn loose against us. In our frontSee Aristides. Fatal is delay.Fam'd are the oracles of Greece—Alas!My oracle, Masistius, is no more.To thee, who hatest all the Spartan breed,I trust my secret purpose. Be my guideTo some near temple, or mysterious cave,Whence voices supernatural unfoldThe destinies of men. The augur here:The nearest, but most awful, is a caveOracular, Lebadia's ancient boast,Where Jupiter Trophonius is ador'd,
Not far beyond Copaeae's neighb'ring lake,Which thou must pass. With costly presents freight,Such as magnificence like thine requires,Thy loaded bark; command my service all.Mardonius issues orders to provideThe bark and presents. Summoning his chiefs,To them he spake: My absence from the campImportant functions claim; three days of ruleTo Mindarus I cede. Till my returnLet not a squadron pass th' Asopian stream.This said, with Hegesistratus he mountsA rapid car. Twelve giants of his guard,Detach'd before, await him on the banksOf clear Copaeae. Silver Phoebè spreadsA light, reposing on the quiet lake,Save where the snowy rival of her hue,The gliding swan, behind him leaves a trail
In luminous vibration. Lo! an isleSwells on the surface. Marble structures thereNew gloss of beauty borrow from the moonTo deck the shore. Now silence gently yieldsTo measur'd strokes of oars. The orange groves,In rich profusion round the fertile verge,Impart to fanning breezes fresh perfumesExhaustless, visiting the sense with sweets,Which soften ev'n Briareus; but the sonOf Gobryas, heavy with devouring care,Uncharm'd, unheeding sits. At length beganTh' Elēan augur, in a learned flowOf ancient lore, to Asia's pensive chiefstorically thus: Illustrious lord,Whose nod controuls such multitudes in armsFrom lands remote and near, the story learnOf sage Trophonius, whose prophetic cellThou wouldst descend. An architect divine,He for the Delphians rais'd their Pythian fane.
His recompense imploring from the god,This gracious answer from the god he drew:"When thrice my chariot hath its circle run,"The prime reward, a mortal can obtain,"Trophonius, shall be thine." Apollo thriceHis circle ran; behold Trophonius dead.With prophecy his spirit was endu'd,But where abiding in concealment longThe destinies envelop'd. Lo! a dearthAfflicts Boeotia. Messengers addressThe Delphian pow'r for succour. He enjoinsTheir care throughout Lebadian tracts to seekOracular Trophonius. Long they roamIn fruitless search; at last a honey'd swarmBefore them flies; they follow, and attainA cave. Their leader enters, when a voice,Revealing there the deity, suggestsCure to their wants, and knowledge of his willHow to be worshipp'd in succeeding times.
To him the name of Jupiter is giv'n.He to the fatal sisters hath access;Sees Clotho's awful distaff; sees the threadOf human life by Lachesis thence drawn;Sees Atropos divide, with direful shears,The slender line. But rueful is the modeOf consultation, though from peril free,Within his dreary cell. In thy behalfThou mayst a faithful substitute appoint.By Horomazes, no, exclaims the chief!It is the cause of empire, from his postCompels the Persian leader; none but heShall with your god confer. Transactions pastTo Hegesistratus he now details,His heart unfolding, nor conceals th' eventIn Asia's camp, when Aemnestus bold,The Spartan legate, prompted, as by heav'n,Him singled out the victim to atone
The death of Sparta's king. Their changing courseOf navigation now suspends their words.Against the influx of Cephissus, downLebadian vales in limpid flow convey'd,The rowers now are lab'ring. O'er their headsHudge alders weave their canopies, and shedDisparted moonlight through the lattic'd boughs;Where Zephyr plays, and whisp'ring motion breathesAmong the pliant leaves. Now roseate tinctsBegin to streak the orient verge of heav'n,Foretok'ning day. The son of Gobryas lands,Where in soft murmur down a channell'd slopeThe stream Hercyna, from Trophonian groves,Fresh bubbling meets Cephissus. He ascendsWith all his train. Th' inclosure, which begirdsThe holy purlieus, through a portal, hungWith double valves on obelisks of stone,Access afforded to the steps of none
But suppliants. Hegesistratus accostsOne in pontific vesture station'd there:Priest of Boeotia's oracle most fam'd,Dismiss all fear. Thy country's guardian hail,This mighty prince, Mardonius. He preservesInviolate her fanes; her willing spearsAll range beneath his standards. To conferWith your Trophonius, lo! he comes with gifts,Surpassing all your treasur'd wealth can boast.His hours are precious, nor admit delay;Accept his sumptuous off'rings, and commenceThe ceremonials due. At first aghastThe holy man survey'd the giant guard.Soon admiration follow'd at thy form,Mardonius. Low in stature, if compar'dWith those unshapen savages, sublimeThou trod'st in majesty of mien, and graceOf just proportion. Last the gems and gold,
Bright vases, tripods, images and crowns,The presents borne by those gigantic hands,With fascinating lustre fix'd the priestTo gaze unsated on the copious store.Pass through, but unaccompany'd, he said,Illustrious Persian. Be th' accepted giftsDeposited within these holy gates.He leads the satrap to a grassy mount,Distinct with scatter'd plantains. Each extendsO'er the smooth green his mantle brown of shade.Of marble white an edifice rotund,In all th' attractive elegance of art,Looks from the summit, and invites the feetOf wond'ring strangers to ascend. The prince,By his conductor, is instructed thus:Observe yon dome. Thou first must enter thereAlone, there fervent in devotion bow
Before two statues; one of Genius good,Of Fortune fair the other. At the wordMardonius enters. Chance directs his eyeTo that expressive form of Genius good,Whose gracious lineaments, sedately sweet,Recall Masistius to the gloomy chief.O melancholy! who can give thee praise?Not sure the gentle; them thy weight o'erwhelms.But thou art wholesome to intemp'rate minds,In vain by wisdom caution'd. In the poolOf black adversity let them be steep'd,Then pride, and lust, and fury thou dost tame.So now Mardonius, by thy pow'r a enthrall'd,Sighs in these words humility of grief.If heav'n, relenting, will to me assignA Genius good, he bears no other nameThan of Masistius. Oh! thou spirit bless'd,
(For sure thy virtue dwells with endless peace)Canst thou, her seat relinquishing awhile,Unseen, or visible, protect thy friendIn this momentous crisis of his fate;Or wilt thou, if permitted? Ah! no moreThink of Mardonius fierce, ambitious, proud,But as corrected by thy precepts mild;Who would forego his warmest hopes of fame,Of pow'r and splendour, gladly to expire,If so the myriads trusted to his chargeHe might preserve, nor leave whole nations fall'n,A prey to vultures on these hostile plains.Come, and be witness to the tears which flow,Sure tokens of sincerity in me,Not us'd to weep; who, humbled at thy loss,Melt like a maiden, of her love bereav'dBy unrelenting death. My demon kind,Do thou descend, and Fortune will pursueSpontaneous and auspicious on her wheel
A track unchang'd. Here turning, he adoresHer flatt'ring figure, and forsakes the dome.Along Hercyna's bank they now proceed,To where the river parts. One channel holdsA sluggish, creeping water, under vaultsOf ebon shade, and soporific yew,The growth of ages on the level lineOf either joyless verge. The satrap here,Nam'd and presented by his former guide,A second priest receives, conductor newThrough night-resembling shadows, which obscureThe sleepy stream, unmoving to the sight,Or moving mute. A fountain they approach,One of Hercyna's sources. From the poresOf spongy rock an artificial vaseOf jetty marble in its round collectsThe slow-distilling moisture. Hence the priest
A brimming chalice to Mardonius bears,Whom in these words he solemnly accosts:This fount is nam'd of Lethè. Who consultsOur subterranean deity, must quaffOblivion here of all preceding thoughts,Sensations, and affections. Reach the draught;If such oblivious sweets this cup contains,I gladly grasp it, cries the chief, and drinks.Ascending thence, a mazy walk they tread,Where all the season's florid children shewTheir gorgeous rayment, and their odours breatheUnspent; while musical in murmur flowsFast down a steep declivity of bedHercyna, winding in a channel new,Apparent often to the glancing eyeThrough apertures, which pierce the loaden boughs
Of golden fruit Hesperian, and th' attireOf myrtles green, o'ershadowing the banks.In alabaster's variegated hues,To bound the pleasing avenue, a faneIts symmetry discover'd on a plat,Thick-set with roses, which a circling skreenOf that fair ash, where cluster'd berries glow,From ruffling gusts defended. Thither speedsMardonius, there deliver'd to a thirdReligious minister supreme. Two youths,In snow-like vesture, and of lib'ral mien,Sons of Lebadian citizens, attend,Entit'led Mercuries. The seer address'dThe Persian warrior: In this mansion pureMnemosynè is worshipp'd; so in GreeceThe pow'r of memory is styl'd. Advance,Invoke her aid propitious to retainWhate'er by sounds, or visions, in his cave
The prophet god reveals. The chief comply'd;The hallow'd image he approach'd, and spake:Thou art indeed a goddess, I revere.Now to Mardonius, if some dream or signPrognosticate success, and thou imprintThe admonitions of unerring heav'nIn his retentive mind; this arm, this swordShall win thy further favour to recordHis name and glory on the rolls of time.This said, with lighter steps he quits the fane.The Mercuries conduct him to a bath,Fed from Hercyna's fairer, second source,In shade sequester'd close. While there his limbsAre disarray'd of armour, to assumeA civil garment, soon as spotless streamsHave purify'd his frame; the priest, who standsWithout, in ecstacy of joy remarks
The rich Mardonian off'rings on their way,By servitors transported to enlargeThe holy treasure. Instant he preparesFor sacrifice. A sable ram is slain.Fresh from ablution, lo! Mardonius comesIn linen vesture, fine and white, as downOf Paphian doves. A sash of tincture bright,Which rivall'd Flora's brilliancy of dye,Engirds his loins; majestical his browsA wreath sustain; Lebadian sandals easeHis steps. Exchanging thus his martial guise,Like some immortal, of a gentler moldThan Mars, he moves. So Phoebus, when he sets,Lav'd by the nymphs of Tethys in their grotOf coral after his diurnal toil,Repairs his splendours, and his rosy trackOf morn resumes. With partial eyes the priestExplores the victim's entrails, and reports
Each sign auspicious with a willing tongue;Then to Mardonius: Thee, Boeotia's friend,Magnificently pious to her gods,Thee I pronounce a votary approv'dBy this Boeotian deity. Now seekIn confidence the cavern. But the ritesDemand, that first an image thou approach,Which none, but those in purity of garb,None, but accepted suppliants of the god,Can lawfully behold. Above the bathA rock was hollow'd to an ample space;Thence issued bubbling waters. See, he said,The main Hercynian fount, whose face reflectsYon Daedalēan workmanship, the formTrophonius bears. Adore that rev'rend beard,The twisted serpents round that awful staff,Those looks, which pierce the mysteries of fate.Next through a winding cavity and vastHe guides the prince along a mossy vault,
Rough with protuberant and tortuous rootsOf ancient woods, which, clothing all above,In depth shoot downward equal to their height;Suspended lamps, with livid glympse and faint,Direct their darkling passage. Now they reachThe further mouth unclosing in a daleAbrupt; there shadow, never-fleeting, rests.Rude-featur'd crags, o'erhanging, thence expelThe blaze of noon. Beneath a frowning cliftA native arch, of altitude which temptsThe soaring eagle to construct his nest,Expands before an excavation deep,Unbowelling the hill. On either sideThis gate of nature, hoary sons of time,Enlarg'd by ages to protentous growth,Impenetrable yews augment the gloom.In height two cubits, on the rocky floorA parapet was rais'd of marble white,
In circular dimension; this upholdsThe weight of polish'd obelisks, by zonesOf brass connected, ornamental fence.A wicket opens to th' advancing prince;Steps moveable th' attentive priest supplies;By whom instructed, to the awful chasmBelow, profound but narrow, where the godHis inspiration breathes, th' intrepid sonOf Gobryas firm descends. His nether limbsUp to the loins he plunges. Downward drawn,As by a whirlpool of some rapid flood,At once the body is from sight conceal'd.Entranc'd he lies in subterranean gloom,Less dark than superstition. She, who caus'dHis bold adventure, with her wonted fumesOf perturbation from his torpid stateAwakes him; rather in a dream suggestsThat he is waking. On a naked bankHe seems to stand; before him sleeps a pool,
Edg'd round by desert mountains, in their heightObscuring heav'n. Without impulsive oars,Without a sail, spontaneous flies a barkAbove the stagnant surface, which, untouch'd,Maintains its silence. On the margin restsThe skiff, presenting to the hero's viewAn aged fire, of penetrating ken,His weight inclining on an ebon staff,With serpents wreath'd, who, beck'ning, thus began:If, feed of Gobryas, thou wouldst know thy fate,Embark with me; Trophonius I am call'd.Th' undaunted chief obeys. In flight more swiftThan eagles, swiftest of the feather'd kind,Th' unmoving water's central spot they gain.At once its bosom opens; down they sinkIn depth to equal that immane descentOf Hercules to Pluto, yet perform,
As in a moment, their portentous way.Around, above, the liquid mass retires,In concave huge suspended, nor bedewsTheir limbs, or garments. Two stupendous valvesOf adamant o'er half the bottom spread;Them with his mystic rod the prophet smites.Self-lifted, they a spacious grot expose,Whose pointed spar is tipt with dancing light,Beyond Phoebean clear. The Persian looks;Intelligent he looks. Words, names and things,Recurring, gather on his anxious mind;When he, who seems Trophonius: Down this caveNone, but the gods oracular, may pass.Here dwell the fatal Sisters; at their toilThe Destinies thou see'st. The thread new-drawnIs thine, Mardonius. Instantly a voice,Which shakes the grot, and all the concave round,Sounds Aemnestus. Swift the direful shearsThe line dissever, and Mardonius, whirl'd
Back from Trophonian gloom, is found supineWithin the marble parapet, which fenc'dThe cavern's mouth. The watchful priest conductsThe agitated satrap, mute and sad,Back to Mnemosynè's abode. His eyesAre sternly fix'd. Now, prince, the seer began,Divulge, whatever thou hast heard and seenBefore this goddess. Priest, he said, suspendThy function now importunate. Remove.The seer withdrawn, the Persian thus alone:Then be it so. To luxury and pow'r,Magnificence and pleasure, I must bidFarewell. Leonidas let Greece extol,Me too shall Persia. Goddess, to thy chargeA name, so dearly purchas'd, I consign.This said, in haste his armour he resumes.Not as Leonidas compos'd, yet brave
Amid the gloom of trouble, he prefersDeath to dishonour. O'er the holy groundHe pensive treads, a parallel to Saul,Return'd from Endor's necromantic cellIn sadness, still magnanimously firmNe'er to survive his dignity, but facePredicted ruin, and, in battle slain,Preserve his fame. Mardonius finds the gates;His friends rejoins; glides down Cephissian floods;Copaeae's lake repasses; and is lodg'dIn his own tent by midnight. Sullen thereHe sits; disturb'd, he shuns repose; accessForbids to all: but Lamachus intrudes,Nefarious counsellor, in fell deviceSurpassing fellest tyrants. Now hath nightUpcall'd her clouds, black signal for the windsTo burst their dungeons; cataracts of rainMix with blue fires; th' ethereal concave groans;
Stern looks Mardonius on the daring Greek,Who, in his wiles confiding, thus began:Supreme o'er nations numberless in arms,Sole hope of Asia, thy return I greetWith joy. Thy absence hath employ'd my soulTo meditate the means, the certain meansFor thee to prosper. Lo! the active sonOf Neocles, who keeps th' Oetaean pass,Lo! Aristides in the camp of Greece,Remain thy only obstacles. Her pow'r,Of them depriv'd, would moulder and disperse,Devoid of counsel, with an edgless sword.Uncommon danger stimulates the wiseTo search for safety through uncommon paths,Much more, when pow'r, when empire and renown,Hang on a crisis. If a serpent's guileBehind the pillows of such foes might lurk;If darting thence, his unsuspected sting
Might pierce their bosoms; if the ambient airCould by mysterious alchymy be chang'dTo viewless poison, and their cups infectWith death; such help would policy disdain?Hast thou not hardy and devoted slaves?Try their fidelity and zeal. No lifeCan be secure against a daring hand.Two Grecian deaths confirm thee lord of Greece.He ceas'd, expecting praise; but honour burnsFierce in the satrap's elevated soul:Dar'st thou suggest such baseness to the sonOf Gobryas? furious he exalts his voice;Guards, seize and strangle this pernicious wolf.Time but to wonder at his sudden fateThe ready guards afford him, and the wretchFit retribution for his crimes receives.This act of eastern equity expelsThe satrap's gloom. Now, Grecian gods, he cries,Smile on my justice. From th' assassin's pointI guard your heroes. By yourselves I swear,My preservation, or success, assur'dBy such unmanly turpitude I spurn.His mind is cheer'd. A tender warmth succeeds,Predominant in am'rous, eastern hearts,A balm to grief, and victor mild of rage.The midnight hour was past, a season dearTo softly-tripping Venus. Through a rangeOf watchful eunuchs in apartments gayHe seeks the female quarter of his tent,Which, like a palace of extent superb,Spreads on the field magnificence. Soft lutes,By snowy fingers touch'd, sweet-warbled songFrom ruby lips, which harmonize the air
Impregnated with rich Panchaean scents,Salute him ent'ring. Gentle hands unclaspHis martial harness, in a tepid bathLave and perfume his much-enduring limbs.A couch is strewn with roses; he reclinesIn thinly-woven Taffeta. So longIn pond'rous armour cas'd, he scarcely feelsThe light and loose attire. Around him smileCircassian Graces, and the blooming flow'rsOf beauty cull'd from ev'ry clime to charm.Lo! in transcending ornament of dressA fair-one all-surpassing greets the chief;But pale her lip, and wild her brilliant eye:Nam'd from Bethulia, where I drew my breath,I, by a father's indigence betray'd,Became thy slave; yet noble my descentFrom Judith ever-fam'd, whose beauty sav'dHer native place. Indignant I withstood
Thy passion. Gentle still a master's rightThou didst forbear, and my reluctant charmsLeave unprophan'd by force. Repuls'd, thy loveGrew cold. Too late contemplating thy worth,I felt a growing flame, but ne'er againCould win thy favour. In the Haram's roundDisconsolate, neglected, I have walk'd;Have seen my gay companions to thy armsPreferr'd, professing passion far unlikeTo mine, Mardonius. Now despair suggestsTo give thee proof of undissembled truth,Which no neglect hath cool'd. To thy success,Thy glory, my virginity is vow'd.In this bright raiment, with collected pow'rsOf beauty, I at Aristides' feetWill throw me prostrate. To th' alluring faceOf my progenitrix a victim fellTh' Assyrian captain, Holofernes proud;
So shall thy foe of Athens fall by mine.The meritorious and heroic deedSoon will erase the transitory stain.O! if successful, let Bethulia hopeFor thy reviving love. Mardonius startsIn dubious trouble. Whether to chastiseSo fierce a spirit, or its zeal admire,He hesitates. Compassion for the sexAt length prevails, suggesting this reply:Fell magnanimity! enormous proofOf such intemp'rate passion! I forgiveWhile I reject thy proffer'd crime, althoughThe deed might fix my glory and success;And in return for thy prepos'trous loveWill safe replace thee in thy native seatWith gifts to raise from indigence thy house.But never, never from this hour will view
Thy face again, Bethulia. Eunuchs, hear;Remove, conceal this woman from my sight.No, thou inhuman, thus Bethulia wild:This shall remove for ever from thy sightA woman scorn'd, and terminate her pains.She said, and struck a poniard through her heart.With shrieks the Haram sounds; th' afflicted fair,The eunuchs shudder; when the satrap thus:Is this another black portent of ill,Stern Horomazes? or is this my crime?No, thou art just. My conscious spirit feelsThy approbation of Mardonius now.But from his breast the dire event expelsAll soft and am'rous cares. His vast command,
His long inaction, and the dread of shameRecur. He quits the chamber; to his ownRepairing, summons Mindarus, and firmIn aspect speaks: The morning soon will dawn.Draw down our slingers, archers, and the skill'dIn flying darts to line th' Asopian brink;Thence gall the Grecians, whose diurnal wantsThat flood relieves. Then Mindarus: O chief,This instant sure intelligence is brought,That from the isthmus, to supply their camp,A convoy, rich in plenty, is descry'dAdvancing tow'rds Cithaeron's neighb'ring pass.Mardonius quick: No moment shall be lost.Bid Tiridates with five thousand horsePossess that pass, and, pouring on the plain,Secure the precious store. This said, he seeksA short repose, and Mindarus withdraws.In arms anon to paragon the morn,The morn new-rising, whose vermillion handDraws from the bright'ning front of heav'n sereneThe humid curtains of tempestuous night,Mardonius mounts his courser. On his bankThe godlike figure soon Asopus views.End of the Twenty-seventh Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the TWENTY-EIGHTH.WHILE lamentation for Masistius deadDepress'd the Persians, undisturb'd the GreeksTo all their camp refreshment had deriv'dFrom clear Asopus. To th' accustom'd edgeOf his abounding flood they now resort.Stones, darts and arrows from unnumber'd ranks,Along the margin opposite dispos'dBy Mindarus, forbid access. RepulseDisbands the Greeks. Exulting, he forgetsCleora; active valour in his breast
Extinguishes the embers, cherish'd longBy self-tormenting memory, and warmthOf fruitless passion. Present too his chief,His friend and kinsman, from a fiery steedMardonius rules and stimulates the fight,Like Boreas, riding on a stormy cloud,Whence issue darts of light'ning, mix'd with hailIn rattling show'rs. The enemies dispers'd,Embolden Mindarus to ford the stream.In guidance swift of cavalry expert,With unresisted squadrons he careersAlong the field. Inviolate the floodHe guards; each hostile quarter he insults.Now Gobryas' son, unfetter'd from the bondsOf superstitious terrors, joyful seesIn Mindarus a new Masistius rise;Nor less the tidings Tiridates sends,Who in Cithaeron's passes hath despoil'd
The slaughter'd foes, inspire the gen'ral's thoughts,Which teem with arduous enterprise. The campHe empties all; beneath whose forming hostThe meadow sounds. The native Persians faceLaconia's station, Greek allies opposeTh' Athenian. All the force of Thebes array'dEnvenom'd Leontiades commands.Greece in her lines sits tranquil; either hostExpects the other. By their augurs stillRestrain'd, they shun the interdicted ford.But of the river's plenteous stream depriv'dBy Mindarus, the Grecians fear a dearthOf that all-cheering element. A rillFlows from a distant spring, Gargaphia nam'd,Their sole resource. Nor dread of other wantsAfflicts them less; their convoy is o'erpow'r'dBy Tiridates. Anxious all exhaustA night disturb'd; the bravest grieve the most,
Lest through severe necessity they quitInglorious their position. Morning shines;When frequent signals from th' external guards,Near and remote, successive rise. To armsAll rush. Along the spacious public wayFrom Megara, obscuring dust ascends.The sound of trampling hoofs, and laden wheels,With shouts of multitude, is heard. Behold,Forth from the cloud, a messenger of joy,Sicinus breaks, of bold auxiliar bandsForerunner swift, and unexpected aidIn copious stores, at Megara's wide portNew-landed from Thermopylae. The campAdmits, and hails in rapturous acclaimEuboean standards, Potidaea's ranks,The laurell'd priest and hero, Timon sage,Th' ennobled heir of Lygdamis, and thee,Melissa's brother, great Oïleus' son,Friend of Leonidas, thee dear to all,
O brave, and gen'rous Medon! From their tentsThe chiefs assemble, when Sicinus spake:Pausanius, gen'ral of united Greece,Accept these ample succours from the handOf provident Themistocles: Possess'dOf Oeta's passes, he the Persian hostNow with impenetrable toils besetsLike beasts of prey, entangled by the skillOf some experienc'd hunter. Thou receive,Just Aristides, from Timothea's love,A suit of armour new, in Chalcis fram'd,Without luxuriant ornament, or gold.The shield, an emblem of thy soul, displaysTruth, equity and wisdom, hand in hand.This for her children, and thy own, consign'd,To her Euboean roof and pious care,She bids thee lift and conquer. Thou restoreThe little exiles in their native homes
To dwell in peace. Her gift, she adds, derivesIts only value from the wearer's worth.In smiles, like Saturn at the tribute pureOf fruits and flow'rs in singleness of heartPaid by religion of the golden age,Timothea's gift the righteous man receives,Not righteous more than practic'd to endureHeroic labours, soon by matchless deedsTo justify the giver. He began:Confederated warriors, who withstandA tyrant's pow'r, unanimous confessYour debt to great Themistocles, the lordOf all-admir'd Timothea. He and IEvince the fruits of concord. Ancient foes,Through her united, cheerful we sustainOur public charge. From gen'ral union GreeceExpects her safety. Him success hath crown'd
In arms and counsel; whether on the mainHis naval flag he spread, or shook the landWith his triumphant step. O, hero-bornPausanias! glowing with Herculean blood,Now under thee let Aristides hopeTo share success, nor tarnish with disgraceHis armour new. Behold, yon river gleamsWith hostile arms. Those standards on the left,Well-known to Attic eyes, are proudly borneBy native Medes and Persians. Treach'rous ThebesLifts her Cadmēan banner on the right.A second time Mardonius forms his hostTo proffer battle. He, perhaps, may fordAsopus, which Tisamenus, the learn'dIn divination, hath forbid our stepsTo pass. Thy former numbers swift arrange.New from a march let these auxiliars guardThe camp. To him Pausanias thus apart:Athenian, hear: Your citizens are vers'dIn this Barbarian warfare, yet unknownTo us. Let Spartans and Athenians changeTheir station. You, an adversary try'dAt Marathon, and foil'd, will best oppose.To vanquish Grecians we accustom'd longWill yon Boeotians and Thessalians face.Such is my will. Concise the Attic sage:Thou hast commanded what my willing thoughtsThemselves devis'd, but waited first to hear.Well canst thou fight, Pausanias. I will striveTo imitate thy deeds and thy renown,On whose increase our liberty and lawsDepend. This said, they part. Behind the rearSoon from the left th' Athenians, from the rightThe Spartans file. Their stations they exchange,Not by Mardonius unperceiv'd. He movesHis Medes and Persians to the post of Thebes,
Whence still the Spartan phalanx they confront,The Thebans still th' Athenian. This observ'd,Pausanias swift to Aristides sendsStrict charge his old position to resume.Now indignation high through all the tribesOf Athens rages. Noble pride, and senseOf just desert, in exclamation fierceBreak from th' exalted populace, who claimTheir soil for parent. Gods! from wing to wingMust we like servile mercenary bands,Like Helots, slaves to Lacedaemon born,Be hurry'd thus obsequious to controulFrom an imperious Spartan? Tegea firstContested our prerogative. The prideOf Sparta next removes us from the post,Assign'd by public judgment; we comply.Must we at her contemptuous nod resumeThe station we forsook? Defending Greece,
Ourselves meanwhile deserted and betray'd,Twice have we lost our city. What is leftOf our abandon'd residence, but dust?Let Greece defend herself. Let us removeFor the last time our standards, hoist our sails,Our floating empire fix on distant shores,Our household gods, our progeny, and name,On some new soil establish, sure to findNone so ingrate as this. The Athenians thusSwell with ingenuous ire, as ocean boils,Disturb'd by Eurus, and the rude careerOf Boreas, threat'ning furious to surmountAll circumscription. But as oft a cloud,Distilling gentle moisture as it glides,Dissolves the rigour of their boist'rous wings,Till o'er the main serenity returns;So from the mouth of Aristides fallComposing words. Insensibly he soothsTheir justly-irritated minds, and calms
Their just resentment. Righteousness and truth,How prevalent your efforts, when apply'dBy placid wisdom! In these strains he spake:Ye men of Athens, at Laconia's callTo meet the flow'r of Asia's host in fightDo ye repine? A station, which impliesPre-eminence of Attic worth, a taskOf all most glorious, which the martial raceOf Sparta shuns, and you should covet most,Ye Marathonian victors? In the fightOf Greece, who trembles at a Median garb,You are preferr'd for valour. Arms the same,The same embroider'd vestment on their limbsEffeminate, the same unmanly souls,Debas'd by vices and monarchal rule,The Medes retain, as when their vanquish'd ranksFled heretofore. With weapons often try'd,
With confidence by victories increas'd,Not now for liberty and Greece aloneYou march to battle; but to keep unspoil'dYour trophies won already, and the name,Which Marathon and Salamis have rais'd,Preserve unstain'd; that men may ever say,Not through your leaders, not by fortune thereYou triumph'd, but by fortitude innate,And lib'ral vigour of Athenian blood.He said and march'd. All follow mute through loveOf Aristides, inexpressive love,Which melts each bosom. Solemn they proceed,Though lion-like in courage, at his callMeek and obedient, as the fleecy breedTo wonted notes of Pan's conducting pipe.Arriv'd, disbanded, in their sep'rate tentsCecropia's tribes exhaust a tedious night,
Unvisited by sleep. The morning breaks;Instead of joy to gratulate her lightThe tone of sadness from dejected hearts,Combining sighs and groans in murmur deep,Alarms the leader. Aristides, shewThy countenance amongst us, hasty spakeThe warrior-poet ent'ring: All thy campEnthusiastic sorrow hath o'erwhelm'd,And ev'ry heart unbrac'd. By earliest dawnEach left his restless couch. Their first discourseWas calm, and fill'd with narratives distinctOf thy accomplishments, and worth. At lengthA soldier thus in agitation spake:"Yet, O most excellent of Gods! O Jove!"This is the man, we banish'd! In thy sight"The most excelling man, whose sole offence"Was all-transcending merit, from his home"Our impious votes expell'd, by envy's spight"Seduc'd. We drove him fugitive through Greece;
"Where still he held ungrateful Athens dear,"For whose redemption from her sloth he rous'd"All Greece to arms." The soldier clos'd in floodsOf anguish. Instant through the concourse ranContagious grief; as if the fiend Despair,From his black chariot, wheeling o'er their headsIn clouds of darkness, dropp'd his pois'nous dewsOf melancholy down to chill the blood,Unnerve the limbs, and fortitude dissolve.Speed, Aristides. By th' immortal pow'rs!The feeblest troop of Persians in this hourMight overcome the tame, desponding forceOf thy dear country, mistress long confess'dOf eloquence and arts, of virtue nowThrough thy unerring guidance. Here the sage:With-hold thy praise, good Aeschylus—Be swift,Arrange my fellow citizens in armsBeneath each ensign of the sev'ral tribes.
I will appear a comforter, a friend,Their public servant. Aeschylus withdraws.Soon Aristides, in his armour new,Timothea's gift, advances from his tent.Should from his throne th' Omnipotent descendIn visitation of the human race,While dreading his displeasure; as to earthAll heads would bend in reverential awe,Contrite and conscious of their own misdeeds;So look th' Athenians, though in all the pompOf Mars array'd, and terrible to halfThe world in battle. Down their corslets brightTears trickle, tears of penitence and shame,To see their injur'd patriot chief assumeIn goodness heav'n's whole semblance, as he movesObservant by, and through the weeping ranksFrom man to man his lib'ral hand extends,Consoling. No resentment he could shew,
Who none had felt. Ascending now on high,He thus address'd the penitential throng.Rate not too high my merit, nor too lowYour own depreciate. Error is the lotOf man; but lovely in the eye of heav'nIs sense of error. Better will you fight,As better men from these auspicious tears,Which evidence your worth, and please the gods.With strength and valour, equity of mindUniting doubles fortitude. Your wives,Your progeny and parents, laws and rites,Were ne'er so well secur'd. The warlike bardRose next: Requested by the sev'ral tribes,In their behalf I promise to thy ruleAll acquiescence. Bid them fight, retreat,Maintain, or yield a station; bid them faceInnumerable foes, surmount a fossDeep as the sea, or bulwarks high as rocks;
Subordination, vigilance, contemptOf toil and death, thy dictates shall command.Th' Oïlean hero, Timon, and the seedOf Lygdamis, are present, who encamp'dAmong th' Athenians. They admire the chief,Nor less the people. While the term of mornWas passing thus, a summons to his tentCalls Aristides. Aemnestus thereSalutes him: Attic friend, a new eventIn Sparta's quarter is to thee unknown;From me accept th' intelligence. The sunWas newly ris'n, when o'er th' Asopian floodAn Eastern herald pass'd. Bèhind him tow'r'dA giant-siz'd Barbarian. He approach'dOur camp; before Pausanias brought, he spake:"I am Briareus, of Mardonian guards"Commander. Through my delegated mouth
"Thus saith the son of Gobryas: I have heard"Among the Greeks your prowess vaunted high,"Ye men of Sparta, that in martial ranks"You either kill, or perish; but I find,"Fame is a liar. I expected long,"You would defy me on the field of war."Have I not seen you shift from wing to wing,"The task imposing on th' Athenians twice"To face the Medes and Persians; while yourselves"Sought with our servants to contend in arms,"Ye brave in name alone! Since you decline"To challenge us, we, prime of eastern blood,"With equal numbers challenge you to prove,"That you possess, what rumour hath proclaim'd,"The boldest hearts in Greece. Acknowledge else"Your boasted valour bury'd in the grave"With your Leonidas, o'erthrown and slain."Pausanias gave no answer, not through fear,But humour torpid and morose, which wrapp'd
In clouds of scorn his brow. Consulting none,With silent pride the giant he dismiss'd.The challenger, in triumph turning back,Repass'd the river. Aemnestus paus'd;A second messenger appear'd. Behold,In blooming vigour, flush'd by rapid haste,Young Menalippus, from the rev'rend seerMegistias sprung. Athenian chief, he said,Bring down thy active, missile-weapon'd troops;On their immediate help Pausanias calls.A cloud of hostile cavalry investsLaconia's quarter. Javelins, arrows, darts,In sheets discharg'd, have choak'd our last resource,Gargaphia's fountain, and our heavy bandsPerplex and harrass. Aristides hears,And issues swift his orders, while the youthContinues thus: Thou knew'st of old my sire,Who at Thermopylae expir'd. The justConsort together. Aristides thus:Ingenuous youth, for Greece thy father bledA spotless victim, but for ever livesCompanion with Leonidas in fame.By heav'n protected, thou shalt live to seeTheir death aton'd; the period is not far.Come on; my force is ready. Medon armsWith Haliartus, once the shepherd-swainIn Oeta's pass to Menalippus known,Whom both embrace with gratulation kind.All march, but reach not Sparta's distant wing,Before the Persians, sated with success,Fil'd back to join Mardonius. Secret heWas communing with Mirzes, most renown'dAmong the Magi. Thus the satrap clos'd:Through each occurrence undisguis'd, O sage!My circumstantial narrative hath run,From where I enter'd first Trophonian ground,
Till my descent and vision in the cave.Speak frankly, Mirzes—nor believe thy words,Whatever black presages they contain,Subjoin'd to all Trophonius hath foretold,Can change my firm resolves, or blunt my sword.Solicitude for Persia to excessMisled thee, satrap, to that graven god,Rejoins the Magus, where, if ought besidesThe craft of Grecian, mercenary priests,It was the demon Arimanius rul'd.He long hath prompted that Elēan seer,Who blunts thy sword by divination false.What thou dost vision call was empty dream;Imagination heated, and disturb'd,A texture wild and various, intermix'dWith ill-match'd images of things, which lastOppress'd thy mind. Thy own distemper fram'dTh' unreal grot, where Destinies of air
In apparition cut thy vital thread;Their act was thine, the oracle thy own,All vague creation of thy erring sleep.Briareus enters. At his tidings glad,Which ostentation sounded, thus exultsMardonius: Sayst thou, Lacedaemon's chiefWas mute, when my defiance shook his ear?Hence to the winds, ye auguries and signs!Ye dreams and mysteries of Greece, avaunt!Thou, Horomazes, not in marble fanes,Nor woods oracular, and caves, dost dwell.It is the pow'r of evil there misguidesInsensate mortals, and misguided me.O, Artemisia! now shall Gobryas' sonLook only, where no mystery can lurk,On ev'ry manly duty. Nothing darkThe tracks of honour shades. To chiefs select,Greek and Barbarian summon'd, he reveals
His fix'd resolves in council. They disperseTo execute his will. Among the restYoung Alexander, Macedonia's lord,Speeds to his quarters in the solemn bow'rOf Dircè. There Mardonius had decreedA cenotaph of marble, newly-rais'dTo his deplor'd Masistius. There the queenOf Macedon, Phoebean Timon's child,Bright Amarantha, like an ev'ning bird,Whose trill delights a melancholy grove,Oft with harmonious skill in Delphian strains,Th' ingenuous practice of her maiden days,Sung of her father, and Masistius good,That friend, that known protector. She her luteWas now in cadence with Dircaean rillsAttuning. Vocal melody she breath'd,Which at another season might have wonHer lord from sadness. Sighing, he her songThus interrupts: Ah! consort dear, as fair,
I come from Persia's council; where the sonOf Gobryas, urg'd by fear of sudden wantThrough his wide host, nor animated lessBy Spartan silence at the challenge proudHis herald bore, determines to rejectThe augur's warnings. O'er the stream he meansTo lead th' embattled nations, and surpriseEre dawn, at least assail the camp of GreeceIn ev'ry station. If she quits her lines,Then will his num'rous cavalry surroundHer heavy phalanx on the level space.O that my ancestor had never leftHis Grecian home in Argos, nor acquir'dEmathia's crown! I never then compell'd,Had borne reluctant arms against a raceBy friendship link'd, affinity, and blood,With me and mine. What horror! cries the queen,While fear surmises, that my husband's swordMay blindly cut my father's vital thread.
But not alone such parricide to shunShould wake thy efforts. Alexander, no;Thou must do more. Our mutual words recall,When thou to Athens by Mardonius sentDidst from thy fruitless ambassy rejoinMe in Trachiniae; whence the Barb'rous chiefRenew'd his march to lay Cecropian domesIn fresh destruction. "What a lot is mine,"Thou saidst? If Xerxes triumph, I become"A slave in purple. Should the Greeks prevail,"Should that Euboean conqueror, the son"Of Neocles be sent th' Athenian scourge . . . .I interrupted thus: "Awhile, dear lord,"We must submit to wear the galling mask,"Necessity imposes. New events"Are daily scatter'd by the restless palm"Of fortune. Some will prove propitious. Wise,
"To all benignant, Aristides serv'd"By us in season will befriend our state."Behold that season come; let Grecian blood,Which warms thy veins, inspire thy prudent tongueThis night th' Athenian hero to appriseOf all these tidings. Thus secure the GreeksAgainst surprisal; timely thus obligeThe first of men, and magnify thy nameIn Greece for ages. Here the youthful king:Though by oppressive Xerxes forc'd to war,Shall I abuse the confidence repos'dBy great Mardonius, qualify'd to winRegard at first, which intercourse augments?I will do all by honour's rules allow'd,Will act a neutral part, withdraw my troops,Ev'n at the hazard of my crown and life,If such my queen's injunction. Ah! forbear
To frown; what means this flushing of thy cheek?Must I betray Mardonius to his foes?She spake abrupt; he started at her look:If forc'd obedience to a tyrant binds,If more, than I, Mardonius holds thy heart,Who has thy dearest confidence abus'd,Thou wilt discredit my accusing tongue.Could from this empty monument the shadeOf just Masistius rise, his awful voiceWould verify a story, till this hourFrom thee conceal'd. My virgin hand in bloodOf one Barbarian miscreant once I stain'd;Not to pollute my hymeneal state,Nor lay Mardonius gasping at my feetLike Mithridates in the streets of Thebes,This hateful camp for Delphi I forsook,Fled from a lawless and presumptuous flame,Insulting me, thy queen, who boast descent
From holy Timon. While for his behoofCollecting Greeks against their country's cause,Thyself was absent, and Mardonius leftMy only guardian; scorning every tie,His daring importunity of loveAssail'd thy consort's ear. What hope, what trustIn such Barbarians? All their faith expir'dWith good Masistius. Should the Greeks be foil'd,How long will Macedon thy realm, how longWill Amarantha be securely heldAgainst a satrap, whose ungovern'd willMay covet both? Of this, O prince, be sure,Her part of shame will Amarantha bearBut brief shall be its date. The poniard still,Which once preserv'd my honour, I possessTo cut my period of dishonour short.The prince impatient, yet attentive, heardHer words; when thus the measure of his wrathFrom his full bosom rapidly o'erflow'd.O impious breach of hospitable ties!O violation base of rights and laws,Exacting swift revenge from heav'n and man,From me the first! Unparallel'd in form,O like the sister of thy Delphian godImmaculate! Did sacrilegious handsThis pure abode of chastity assailWith profanation? Less a friend to Greece,Than foe to false Mardonius, now I go.He said, and order'd forth his swiftest steed.By moon-light, twinkling on a shaded track,He urg'd his secret way beyond the springsAsopian; whence an outlet short and closeThrough mount Cithaeron to th' adjacent lineOf Aristides led. Meantime the soundOf steps advancing Amarantha heard;She heard, and saw Mardonius. He his paceStopp'd short, inclining with obeisance low
His stately frame. Through terror and amazeTo earth she rigid grew, of pow'r to flyDepriv'd. He distant spake: Imperial dame,That he offended once, Mardonius makesA penitent confession. O! that faultTo no innate discourtesy impute,But Eastern manners, not as Grecian pure;The ignorance which err'd, by thee is chang'dTo veneration. From my presence here,Which ne'er before intruded on this seatOf thy retirement, do not too severeA new offence interpret; rest assur'd,A solemn cause impels. He silent waits,Nor moves; till, gliding silently away,Like Dian fair and chaste, but less severe,The queen withdrew, and tow'rds a gallant chief,Perhaps by her devices near his fall,Thus far relented; for the private wrongThe frank atonement rais'd a generous sigh;
Against the public enemy of Greece,Unquenchable she burn'd. Now left alone,Before the cenotaph he kneel'd and spake:To-morrow, O! to-morrow let my helmBlaze in thy beams auspicious, spirit bright,Whose name adorns this honorary tomb!The weight of Asia's mighty weal, the weightOf fifty myriads on thy friend augmentsFrom hour to hour. Yet purg'd of gloomy thoughts,Clear of ambition, save to win the palmOf victory for Xerxes, I approachThy suppliant. Thou an intercessor pureFor me, deceiv'd by Grecian seers and gods,Before the throne of Horomazes stand,That he may bless my standards, if aloneTo guard so many worshippers, and spreadBy their success his celebrated nameThrough each Hesperian clime. Now grant a sign,
Masistius, ere thy faithful friend depart,Fix'd, as he is, to vanquish, or to fall.He ceas'd. Quick rapture dims his cheated eyes.He sees in thought a canopy of light,Descending o'er the tomb. In joy he speedsTo preparation for the destin'd march.End of the Twenty-eighth Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the TWENTY-NINTH.AMONG the Greeks their first nocturnal watchWas near its period. From Laconia's wingReturn'd, th' Athenian leader thus bespakeSicinus: Worthy of my trust, give ear.Within six hours the army will decampTo chuse a friendlier station; so the chiefsIn gen'ral council, as Gargaphia choak'dWithholds her wonted succour, have resolv'd.At Juno's fane, yet undespoil'd, though nearPlataea's ruins, ev'ry band is charg'd
To reassemble. . . . Suddenly appearsA centinel, who speaks: A stranger, nearThe trenches waits, thee; us in peaceful wordsSaluting, he importunate requiresThy instant presence. Aristides hastes;To whom the stranger: Bulwark of this camp,Hear, credit, weigh, the tidings which I bear.Mardonius, press'd by fear of threat'ning want,At night's fourth watch the fatal stream will pass,Inflexibly determin'd, though forbidBy each diviner, to assail your hostWith all his numbers. I against surpriseAm come to warn you; thee alone I trust,My name revealing. I, O man divine!I, who thus hazard both my realm, and life,Am Alexander, Macedonian friendOf Athens. Kindly on a future dayRemember me. He said, and spurr'd his steedBack through the op'ning of Cithaeron's hill.By Aristides instantly detach'd,Sicinus calls each leader to attendPausanias. Attica's great captain joinsThe council full. His tidings he relates,Concluding thus with exhortation sage:We destitute of water had resolv'dTo change our station. Now without a pauseWe must anticipate th' appointed hourFor this retreat, nor ling'ring tempt the forceOf squadrons swift to intercept our march.All move your standards. Let Mardonius bringA host discourag'd by their augur's voice;Who are forbid to pass the fatal stream,But are compell'd by famine and despairTo inauspicious battle. We to heav'nObedient, heav'n's assistance shall obtain.A situation, safeguard to our flanksAgainst superior and surrounding horse,
In sight of burnt Plataea, of her fanesDefac'd, and violated gods, I know;There will assure you conquest. All assent.At once the diff'rent Grecians, who composeThe center, lift their ensigns. O'er the plainFirst swiftly tow'rds Plataean Juno's domeSpeeds Adimantus. In array more slowThe rest advance. Cleander guards the rear;Brave youth, whom chance malicious will bereaveOf half the laurels to his temples due.Th' Athenians arm delib'rate; in whose trainIllustrious Medon ranks a faithful troop,His hundred Locrians. Haliartus there,There Timon's few, but gen'rous Delphians stand,By Aristides all enjoin'd to watchLaconia's host. That sternly-tutor'd race,To passion cold, he knew in action slow,
In consultation torpid. Anxious longHe waits, and fears the eyelids of the morn,Too soon unclosing, may too much reveal.Sicinus, hast'ning to Laconia's camp,Finds all confus'd, subordination lostIn altercation, wond'rous in that breedOf discipline and manners, nor less strange,Than if the laws of nature in the skyDissolv'd, should turn the moon and planets looseFrom their accustom'd orbits, to obeyThe sun no longer. When his first commandPausanias issu'd for the march, nor thoughtOf disobedience to disturb his pride;One leader, Amompharetus, whose bandOf Pitanè rever'd him, as the firstAmong the brave, refusal stern oppos'd,Protesting firm, he never would retreatBefore Barbarians. Aemnestus swift,
Callicrates and others, long approv'dIn arms, entreat the Spartan to submit,Nor disconcert the salutary planOf gen'ral council. Sullen he replies:Not of that council, I will ne'er disgraceThe Spartan name. But all the Greeks withdrawnExpect our junction at Saturnia's dome,Callicrates and Aemnestus plead.Would'st thou expose thy countrymen to faceUnaided yonder multitude of Medes,Untry'd by us in combat? Yes, rejoinsThe pertinacious man, ere yield to flight.His troop applauded. Now contention harshResounded high, exhausting precious hours,The Spartan march retarding; when arriv'dSicinus witness to the wild debate.At length Pausanias knit his haughty brow
At Amompharetus, and spake: Weak man,Thou art insane. The chastisement thy due,Our time allows not. Instant march, or stayBehind and perish. In his two-fold graspThe restive Spartan lifting from the groundA pond'rous stone, before the gen'ral's feetPlac'd it, and thus: Against dishonest flightFrom strangers vile, I rest my suffrage there,Nor will forsake it. To Sicinus turn'dPausanias: Tell th' Athenians what thou see'st.I by Cithaeron's side to Juno's faneAm hast'ning; charge their phalanx to proceed.Sicinus back to Aristides flies.His ready phalanx from the lines he draws,Wing'd with his horse and bowmen; yet his courseSuspends at Sparta's camp. There sullen, fix'dLike some old oak's deep-rooted, knotted trunk,
Which hath endur'd the tempest-breathing monthsOf thrice a hundred winters, yet remainsUnshaken, there amidst his silent troopSat Amompharetus. To him the sage:Unwise, though brave, transgressing all the lawsOf discipline, though Spartan born and train'd;Arise, o'ertake thy gen'ral and rejoin.Thy country's mercy by some rare exploitWin to forgive thy capital default,Excess of courage. Where Pausanias, arm'dWith pow'r unlimited in war, where allThe Spartan captains in persuasion fail'd,Requir'd not less than Jove himself, or JoveIn Aristides to prevail. UproseThe warrior, late inflexible; yet slow,In strictest regularity of march,Led his well-order'd files. Correcting thus
The erring Spartan, Aristides sweptAcross the plain to fill the gen'ral host.Not yet the twilight, harbinger of morn,Had overcome the stars. The Persian scouts,Who rang'd abroad, observing that no soundWas heard, no watch-word through the Grecian lines,Adventur'd nigh, and found an empty space.Swift they appris'd Mardonius, who had form'dHis whole array. Encircled by his chiefsGreek and Barbarian, first he gave command,That ev'ry hand provide a blazing torchTo magnify his terrors, and with lightFacilitate pursuit; then gladsome thusAddress'd his friends of Thessaly and Thebes:Now Larissaean Thorax, and the restOf Aleuadian race; now Theban lords,
Judge of the Spartans justly. Vaunted highFor unexampled prowess, them you sawFirst change their place, imposing on the sonsOf Athens twice the formidable taskTo face my chosen Persians; next they gaveTo my defiance no reply, and lastAre fled before me. Can your augurs shewA better omen, than a foe dismay'd?But, kind allies, to you my friendly careShall now be prov'd. These thunderbolts of war,As you esteem them, will Mardonius chuseFor his opponents. Level your attackEntire against th' Athenians. None I dread;Yet by the sun less terrible to meIs that Pausanias, head of Sparta's race,Than Aristides. Him Masistius lov'd;If you o'erthrow, preserve him; in the nameOf your own gods I charge you. Mithra, shineOn me no longer, if in grateful warmth
Confessing ev'ry benefit receiv'd,I do not clasp that guardian of my friend!Now, Persians, mount your bold Nisaean steeds,Alert your targets grasp, your lances poise;The word is Cyrus. Royal spirit! lookOn me, deriv'd from thy illustrious blood,Yet not in me illustrious, if this dayMy hand, or courage faint. Look down on these,Sons of thy matchless veterans. The fire,Which at thy breath o'erspread the vanquish'd East,Light in their offs'pring; that the loud reportOf their achievements on Asopian banks,Far as the floods of Ganges may proclaimThe western world a vassal to thy throne.He said, and spurr'd his courser. Through the fordHe dashes, follow'd by th' impetuous speedOf tall equestrian bands in armour scal'dWith gold, on trappings of embroider'd gloss
Superbly seated. Persians next and MedesAdvance, an infantry select, whose mailBright-gilt, or silver'd o'er, augments the lightOf sparkling brands, innumerably wav'dBy nations, plunging through the turbid floodIn tumult rude, emblazing, as they pass,The skies, the waters, and with direst howlDistracting both. Like savage wolves they rush,As with ferocious fangs to rend the Greeks,To gnaw their flesh, and satiate in their bloodThe greedy thirst of massacre. In chiefHere Mindarus commands, by Midias join'dAnd Tiridates, powerless all to curb,Much more to marshal such Barbarian throngs,Which, like a tumbling tide on level strands,When new the moon impels it, soon o'erwhelm'dTh' Asopian mead; or like the mightier surge,When ireful Neptune strikes the ocean's bedProfound. Upheav'd, the bottom lifts and rolls
A ridge of liquid mountains o'er th' abodesOf some offending nation; while the heav'nsWith coruscation red his brother JoveInflames, and rocks with thunder's roar the poles.Th' auxiliar Greeks compact and silent marchIn strength five myriads. In arrangement justThe foot by Leontiades, the wingsOf horse by Thorax and Emathia's kingWere led. Now, long before th' unwieldy massOf his disorder'd multitude advanc'd,Mardonius, rushing through the vacant linesOf Lacedaemon, tow'rds Cithaeron bentHis swift career. Faint rays began to streakThe third clear morning of that fruitful month,The last in summer's train. Immortal day!Which all the Muses consecrate to fame.O thou! exalted o'er the laurell'd train,High as the sweet Calliopè is thron'd
Above her sisters on the tuneful mount,O father, hear! Great Homer, let one rayFrom thy celestial light an humble sonOf thine illuminate; lest freedom mournHer chosen race dishonour'd in these strains.Thou too, my eldest brother, who enjoy'stThe paradise thy genius hath portray'd,Propitious smile. Lend vigour to a Muse,Who in her love of freedom equals thine,But to sustain her labours from thy storeMust borrow language, sentiment and verse.Cithaeron's ridge, from where Asopus rose,Stretch'd to Plataea, with a southern fenceConfining one broad level, which the floodsFrom their Hesperian head in eastward flowMeandring parted. O'er the mountain's footHis course Pausanias destin'd, where the soilAbrupt and stony might the dread career
Of Persia's cavalry impede. His ranks,Accompany'd by Tegea's faithful breed,Had measur'd now ten furlongs of their marchHalf o'er the plain to reach the friendly ground;Then halted near an Eleusinian domeOf Ceres; thence they mov'd, but timely firstWere join'd by Amompharetus. At lengthThe chosen track was gain'd. Pausanias castHis eyes below first northward, and survey'dBetween the river and his empty campA blaze involving all the plain. The yellOf mouths Barbarian, of unnumber'd feetTh' impetuous tread, which crush'd the groaning turf,The neigh of horses, and their echoing hoofs,Th' insulting clash of shields and sabres, shookThe theatre of mountains; hollow-voic'd,Their cavities rebellow'd, and enlarg'dThe hideous sound. His eyes the orient dawn
Attracted next. Saturnia's roof he view'd,But distant still, around whose sacred wallsThe first-departed Grecians stood in armsBeneath wide-floating banners, wish'd more nigh.There was the Genius of Plataea seenBy fancy's ken, a hov'ring mourner seen,O'er his renown'd, but desolated seat,One mass of ruins mountainous. He mark'dTh' Athenians traversing the meads belowIn full battalia. Resolute, sedate,Without one shield in disarray, they mov'dTo join the gen'ral host. Beyond the streamIn prospect rose the battlements of Thebes;Whose sons perfidious, but in battle firm,With phalanges of other hostile GreeksSpread on the bank, and menace to surmountThe shallow current for some dire attempt.To Aemnestus, marching by his side,Pausanias turns; the army he commands
To halt; while, mast'ring all unmanly fear,His haughty phlegm serenely thus fulfilsA leader's function: Spartan, we in vainPrecipitate our junction with alliesAt Juno's distant fane; the hour is past;The Pitanēan mutineer the cause.Seest thou yon Persian squadrons? They precedeThe whole Barbarian multitude. The stormIs gath'ring nigh; we sep'rate must abideThe heavy weight of this unequal shock,Unless th' Athenians, still in sight, impartA present aid. A herald swift he sendsTo Aristides, with this weighty charge:"All Greece is now in danger, and the blood"Of Hercules in me. Athenian help"Is wanted here, their missile-weapon'd force."Last he address'd Tisamenus: ProvideThe sacrifice for battle—Warriors, form.Slain is the victim; but th' inspecting seerReveals no sign propitious. Now full nighThe foremost Persian horse discharge aroundTheir javelins, darts, and arrows. Sparta's chiefIn calm respect of inauspicious heav'nDirects each soldier at his foot to restThe passive shield, submissive to endureTh' assault, and watch a signal from the gods.A second time unfavorable proveThe victim's entrails. Unremitted show'rsOf pointed arms distribute wounds and death.Oh! discipline of Sparta! Patient standsThe wounded soldier, sees a comrade fall,Yet waits permission from his chief to shieldHis own, or brother's head. Among the restCallicrates is pierc'd; a mortal strokeHis throat receives. Him celebrate, O muse!Him in historic rolls deliver'd down
To admiration of remotest climesThrough latest ages. These expiring wordsBeyond Olympian chaplets him exalt,Beyond his palms in battle: Not to dieFor Greece, but dying, ere my sword is drawn,Without one action worthy of my name,I grieve. He said, and fainting on the breastOf Aemnestus, breath'd in spouting bloodHis last, departing thy attendant meet,Leonidas, in regions of the bless'd.A second victim bleeds; the gath'ring foesTo multitude are grown; the show'rs of deathIncrease; then melted into flowing griefPausanian pride. He, tow'rds the fane remoteOf Juno lifting his afflicted eyes,Thus suppliant spake: O Goddess! let my hopesBe not defeated, whether to obtainA victory so glorious, or expireWithout dishonour to Herculean blood.Amidst the pray'r Tegēan Chileus, freeFrom stern controul of Lacedaemon's laws,No longer waits inactive; but his bandLeads forth, and firmly checks th' insulting foe.The sacrifice is prosp'rous, and the wordFor gen'ral onset by Pausanias giv'n.Then, as a lion, from his native rangeConfin'd a captive long, if once his chainHe breaks, with mane erect and eyes of fireAsserts his freedom, rushing in his strengthResistless forth; so Sparta's phalanx turnsA face tremendous on recoiling swarmsOf squadron'd Persians, who to Ceres' faneAre driv'n. But there Mardonius, like the godOf thunders ranging o'er th' ethereal vaultThick clouds on clouds impregnated with storms,His chosen troops embattles. Bows and dartsRejecting, gallantly to combat closeThey urge undaunted efforts, and to death
Their ground maintain, in courage, or in mightNot to the Greeks inferior, but in arms,In discipline and conduct. Parties small,Or single warriors, here with vigour wieldThe battle-ax and sabre; others rushAmong the spears, to wrench away, or breakBy strength of hands, the weapons of their foes.But fiercest was the contest, where sublimeThe son of Gobryas from a snow-white steedShot terror. There selected warriors charg'd,A thousand vet'rans, by their fathers train'd,Who shar'd renown with Cyrus. On the right,Close to his gen'ral's side, Briareus grasp'dA studded mace, Pangaeus on the left,Nam'd from a Thracian hill. The bristly frontOf Sparta's phalanx, with intrepid looksMardonius fac'd, and thunder'd out these words:Come, twice-defy'd Pausanias, if thou hear'st;Thy Spartan prowess on Mardonius try.Pausanias heard; but shunn'd retorting words,In saturnine disdain laconic thusHis men addressing: Yours the soldier's part,The gen'rals mine; advance not, but receiveThese loose Barbarians on your steady points.Not one of Persia's breed, though early train'd,So strong a javelin as Mardonius lanc'd,Or in its aim so true. Three brothers grac'dThe foremost line of Sparta, natives allOf sweet Amyclae, all in age and armsMature, their splendid lineage from the stockOf Tyndarus deriving. Them on earthThree javelins, whirl'd successive, laid supine,An effort of Mardonius. Three in rankBehind partake the same resistless doom,
Three bold companions in the hardy chaceOf boars on green Taÿgetus. Supply'dWith weapons new, the phalanx still to goreHe perseveres unweary'd, not unlikeSome irritated porcupine, of sizePortentous, darting his envenom'd quillsThrough each assailant. In Laconia's frontSo many warriors and their weapons fall'n,Leave in her triple tire of pointed steelA void for swift impression of her foes.In rush Briareus and Pangaeus huge,Whose maces send fresh numbers to the shades.The op'ning widens. On his vaulting steedMardonius follows, like ensanguin'd MarsBy his auxiliars grim, dismay and rage,Preceded. Rivalling the lightning's beams,The hero's sabre bright and rapid wheelsAloft in air. A comet thus inflamesThe cheek of night; pale mortals view in dread
Th' unwonted lustre, transient tho' it be,Among the lights of heav'n. Pausanias rous'd,Advancing, at Briareus points his lance.Meantime six Spartans of the younger classAssail Mardonius. One his bridle grasp'd;The Persian sabre at the shoulder closeLopp'd off th' audacious arm. Another stoop'dTo seize the chieftain's foot, and drag him down;Pois'd on his stirrup, he in sunder smoteThe Spartan's waist. Another yet approach'd,Who at a blow was cloven to the chin.Two more the gen'rous horse, uprearing, dash'dMaim'd and disabled to the ground; the lastHis teeth disfigur'd, and his weight oppress'd.As some tall-masted ship, on ev'ry sideAssail'd by pinnaces and skiffs whose strengthIs number, drives her well-directed prowThrough all their feeble clusters; while her chiefElate contemplates from her lofty deck
The hostile keels upturn'd, and floating dead,Where'er she steers victorious: so the steedNisaean tramples on Laconian slain,Triumphant so Mardonius from his seatLooks down. But fate amidst his triumph shewsBriareus yielding to a forceful blowOf stern Pausanias, and Pangaeus pierc'dBy Amompharetus. Their giant bulks,Thrown prostrate, crash three long-protended rowsOf Spartan spears. Wide-branching thus huge oaks,By age decay'd, or twisted from the rootsBy rending whirlwinds, in their pond'rous fallLay desolate the under shrubs, and treesOf young, unstable growth. More awful still,Another object strikes the satrap's eye;With nodding plumes, and formidable stride,Lo! Aemnestus. Asia's gen'ral feelsEmotions now, which trouble, not degrade
His gen'rous spirit. Not, as Priam's sonOn sight of dire Achilles, thoughts of flightPossess Mardonius, but to wait the foe,And if to die, with honour die, if liveEnjoy a life of fame. His giant guardAround him close; one levels at the casqueOf Aemnestus; but the weighty maceSlides o'er the Spartan's slanting shield, and spendsIts rage in dust. The stooping giant leavesHis flank unguarded, and admits a stroke,Which penetrates the entrails. Down he sinks,Another tow'r of Asia's battle strewnIn hideous ruin. Soon a second bleeds,A third, a fourth. The fifth in posture standsTo crush the victor with a blow well-aim'd;Him Menalippus at the brawny pitOf his uplifted arm transpiercing deepDisables. Aemnestus struggles longTo grapple with his victim, and invokes
Leonidas aloud. The active sonOf Gobryas plants throughout the Spartan shieldA wood of Javelins. His Nisaean horse,Careering, vaulting, with his fangs and hoofsProtects his lord. The guards, who still furviv'd,With faithful zeal their whole united strengthExert unwearied for a lib'ral chief.Some paces backward Aemnestus forc'd,Impels his heel against a loos'ning stone,Broad, craggy, scarce inferior to the weightDischarg'd by Hector on the massy barsOf Agamemnon's camp. The Spartan quickFrom his left arm removes the heavy shield,With javelins thick transfix'd. From earth he liftsThe casual weapon, and with caution marksThe fatal time and distance. O'er the headsOf thy surrounding guard the fragment hurl'dDescends, Mardonius, on thy manly chest,And lays thee o'er thy courser's back supine
Without sensation. O, illustrious man,Whose dazzling virtues through thy frailties beam'd!Magnanimous, heroic, gen'rous, pureIn friendship, warm in gratitude! This doomAt once dissolves all interval of painTo mind, or body. Not a moment moreHast thou, ingenuous satrap, to repine,Or grieve. Go, hero, thy Masistius greet,Where no ambition agitates the breast,No gloomy veil of superstition blinds,No friend can die, no battle can be lost!This fall, to Greece decisive as to heav'nEnceladus o'erthrown, when, thunder-pierc'd,He under Aetna's torrid mass was chain'd,Discomfits Asia's hopes. In fresh arrayMeantime the phalanx, by Pausanias form'd,Proceeds entire. Facility of skillDirects their weapons; pace by pace they move
True to the cadence of accustom'd notesFrom gentle flutes, which trill the Doric laysOf Alcman and Terpander. Slow they gainThe ground, which Persia quits, till Chileus boldWith his Tegaeans gores the hostile flanks;Confusion then, and gen'ral rout prevail.The fugitives proclaim Mardonius slain;The whole Barbarian multitude disperseIn blind dismay; cool Mindarus in vainAttempts to check their flight; all seek the camp;And now the Spartan flutes, combin'd with shoutsOf loud Tegaeans stimulate his speedAcross the ford. His trenches he regains,And there to Midias, Tiridates brave,And chosen satraps, gath'ring at his call,Thus spake: The flow'r of Asia in the dustReclines his glories. Feel your loss like me,Not overcome by sorrow, or surprise
At changes natural to man, the sportOf his own passions, and uncertain chance.Vicissitudes of fortune I have prov'd,One day been foil'd, a conqueror the next.In arduous actions though experienc'd mindsHave much to fear, not less of hope remainsTo animate the brave. Amid this stormThe throne of Cyrus, your exalted sires,Your own nobility, recall; deserveThe rank, you hold; occasion now presentsFor such a trial. To uphold my king,My country's name, and piously revengeMy kindred blood new-spilt, my sword, my arm,My life, I destine. Multitude is left,Surpassing twenty myriads; ev'n despairBefriends us; famine threat'ning, and the dreadOf merciless resentment in our foes,May force these rally'd numbers to obtainFrom their own swords relief. Behold your camp,
Strong-fenc'd and bulwark'd by Masistian care,A present refuge. See th' auxiliar GreeksEntire, advancing on th' inferior bandsOf Athens. Still may Xerxes o'er the WestExtend his empire, and regret no partOf this disaster, but Mardonius slain.Assume your posts, for stern defence provide.End of the Twenty-ninth Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the THIRTIETH.O God of light and wisdom! thee the MuseOnce more addresses. Thou didst late beholdThe Salaminian brine with Asian bloodDiscolour'd. Climbing now the steep ascentTo thy meridian, for a stage of warMore horrible and vast, thy beaming eyePrepare. Thou over wide Plataea's field,Chang'd to a crimson lake, shall drive thy car,Nor see a pause to havoc, till the WestIn his dark chamb rs shuts thy radiant face.Now had the herald, to Cecropia's chiefSent by Pausanias, in his name requir'dImmediate aid. No doubt suspends the hasteOf Aristides; who arrays his ranksWith cordial purpose to sustain that strengthOf Greece, Laconia's phalanx. Lo! in sightNew clouds of battle hov'ring. He discernsTh' array of Leontiades, with wingsOf Macedonic, and Thessalian horse;Then calls Sicinus: Friend, he said, observe;Robust and bold, to perfidy inur'd,Not less than arms, yon Thebans cross our march.I trust the justice of our cause will foilThem, thrice our number; but events like thisAre not in man's disposal. If I fall,Not rashly, good Sicinus, rest assur'd,Themistocles survives. The gate of GreeceHe guards, Euboea and Thessalia holds,Those granaries of plenty. Eastern shores
With all his force, perhaps victorious now,Xanthippus will relinquish, and maintainThe sea auxiliar to thy prudent lord;Thus all be well, though Aristides bleeds:This to Themistocles report. But go,Fly to Cleander; him and all the GreeksRouse from the fane of Juno to the field;Both Spartans and Athenians want their aid.Thy tribe, undaunted Cimon, place behindOlympiodorus; if his active bandsRepel Thessalia's horse, avoid pursuit;Wheel on the flank of Thebes. Here Delphi's priest:Behold Emathia's standards front thy right;With Haliartus, and Oileus' son,Let me be station'd there. I trust, the spouseOf Amarantha, at her father's sight,Will sheath a sword unvoluntary drawn,Nor ties of hospitality and blood
Profane to serve Barbarians. I acceptThe gen'rous offer, sage and gallant seer,Spake Aristides. In that wing thy friend,The learn'd and manly Aesehylus presides.But, to thy god appealing, I enjoinThy rev'rend head to cover in retreatIts unpolluted hairs, should fire of youth,Or yet more strong necessity, impelThy son to battle. Here th' enraptur'd priest:The inspiration of my god I feel;A glorious day to Athens I presage,I see her laurels fresh. Apollo joinsHis sister Pallas to preserve a race,Which all the Muses love. His awful powerWill chain the monster parricide, and rouseThe Grecian worth in Alexander's heart.These animated accents fire the line.Within the measure of an arrow's flight
Each army now rank'd opposite. A thoughtOf piety and prudence from his placeMov'd Aristides. Single he advanc'dBetween the hosts; offensive arms he leftBehind him; ev'n his plumed helm resign'dGave to his placid looks their lib'ral flow.Before him hung his ample shield alone,Timothea's gift, whose sculptur'd face display'dTruth, equity, and wisdom hand in hand,As in his breast. Exalting high in toneHis gracious voice, he thus adjur'd his foes:Ye men deriv'd from Cadmus, who in GreeceEstablish'd letters, fruitful mother sinceOf arts and knowledge, to Barbarian spoilThis hour expos'd; ye sons of Locris, hear,Thessalians, Phocians, Dorians, all compell'dBy savage force to arm against your friends,Of language, rites and manners with your own
Congenial: Aristides, in the nameOf all the Grecian deities, invokesYour own sensations to disarm your handsOf impious weapons, which retard the helpWe bear to those now struggling in defenceOf Grecian freedom, sepulchres and fanes.He said; was heard like Enoch, like the manWho walk'd with God, when eminently wise,Among th' obscene, the violent, and false,Of justice and religion, truth and peaceHe spake exploded, and from menac'd deathTo God withdrew. The fell Boeotians rendThe sky with threat'ning clamour, and their spearsShake in defiance; while the word to chargePerfidious Leontiades conveys.Retreating backward, Aristides cloathsHis face in terror. So Messiah chang'dHis countenance serene, when full of wrath
Bent on Satanic enemies, who shookHeav'n's peaceful champaign with rebellious arms,He grasp'd ten thousand thunders, and infix'dPlagues in their souls; while darts of piercing fireThrough their immortal substances, by sinSusceptible of pain, his glaring wheelsShot forth pernicious. Aristides leadsHis phalanx on. Now Greeks to Greeks opposeTheir steely structures of tremendous war.With equal spears and shields their torrent frontsThey clash together; like the justling rocks,Symplegades Cyanean, at the mouthOf Thracia's foaming Bosphorus, were feign'd,Infrangible opponents, to sustainA mutual shock which tempested the frith,Dividing Europe from the Orient world.Meanwhile Phoebean Timon's glowing zeal,Replete with patriot and religious warmth,
Thus in the wing which Aeschylus had form'd,Bespake the encircling chieftains: O'er the spaceBetween Asopus, and the main arrayOf Thebes, I see the Macedonian horseBut half advanc'd: Their tardy pace denotesReluctance. Lo! I meditate an actTo prove my zeal for universal Greece,Her violated altars, and the tombsRobb'd of their precious dust. My slender band,So long companions in adventures highWith your choice Locrians, Haliartus, joinTo Medon's banner. Aeschylus, observeMy progress; if my piety succeeds,Thou, as a soldier, take advantage full.So saying, o'er the plain in solemn paceHis rev'rend form he moves, by snowy bandsPontifical around his plumed helmDistinguish'd. Thus from Salem's holy gate
Melchisedek, the priest of him Most High,Went forth to meet, and benedictions pourOn Terah's son in Shaveh's royal vale.The Macedonian squadrons at the sightFall back in rev'rence; their dismounting princeSo wills. The father and the son embrace.Oh! Amarantha's husband! joyful sighsThe parent. Oh! my Amarantha's sire!In equal joy the husband. Timon then:A Greek in blood, to Delphi's priest ally'd,The god of Delphi's blessing now secure;Abandon these Barbarians to the fate,Which in the name of Phoebus I denounceFor his insulted temple, and the rapeOf Amarantha from Minerva's shrine.Yet to unsheath an unsuspected sword
Against them, neither I, nor heav'n require,Less thy own honour; but repass the stream,Amid this blind uproar unnotic'd seekThermopylae again; and reach thy realm.O'er all that clime Themistocles prevails,My friend; his present amity obtain,Cecropia's future love, nor hazard moreThy fame and welfare. Aristides knowsMy truth, replies the monarch; now to theeObedience prompt a second proof shall yield.Ascend a steed; to Amarantha's armsI will conduct thee first; th' auspicious flightOf both, a father shall assist and bless.They speed away, in extasy the sireTo clasp his darling child in Dirce's grove.This pass'd in Medon's eye, who watchful stoodWith Haliartus, and a troop advanc'd,
In care for Timon. When apparent nowThe Macedonian squadrons quit the fieldOf strife, the heavy-cuirass'd of his wingWith serry'd shields by Aeschylus is led,In evolution wheeling on the flanksOf that strong mass'd battalia, which compos'dThe hostile center. First in phalanx stoodUnwilling Locrians. Medon lifts his voice,And to each eye abash'd his awful shape,Like some reproving deity, presents;They hear, they see Oïleus in his son,As ris'n a mourning witness of their shameFrom his sepulchral bed. The banners dropBefore him; down their spears and bucklers fall;They break, disperse, and fly with children's fear,When by authority's firm look surpris'dIn some attempt forbidden, or unmeet.Boeotian files are next. With sudden wheelThey form a front, and dauntless wait the assault.Still in the van robust and martial ThebesUnbroken stems th' agility and skillOf her opponent Athens. Long unspentThe tide of well-conducted battle flowsWithout decision strong. At length by fateIs Leontiades impell'd to meetCecropia's chief, where Thebes began to feelHis mighty pressure. Whether justice strungHis nerves with force beyond a guilty hand,Or of his manly limbs the vigour match'dHis fortitude of mind; his falchion cloveDown to the neck that faithless Greek, of GreeceThe most malignant foe. The treacherous deed,Which laid fair Thespia, with Plataean tow'rsIn dust, he thus aton'd. A bolt from heav'nThus rives an oak, whose top divided hangsOn either side obliquely from the trunk.Murichides the Hellespontin bleeds,Too zealous friend of Asia, in whose cause
This day he arm'd. By great Mardonius charg'dLate messenger of friendship, he in peaceOn Salaminian shores had touch'd the hand,Which now amid the tumult pierc'd his heart,Not willingly, if known. Then Lynceus fell,From Oedipēan Polynices sprung,The last remains of that ill-fated house.Mironides and Clinias near the sideOf Aristides fought, his strong support.Yet undismay'd and firm three hundred chiefs,Or sons of proudest families in Thebes,Dispute the victory till death. MeantimeOlympiodorus from the left had gall'dThessalia's squadrons, like a sleety stormChecking their speed. Athenian horse, though few,Mix'd with their bowmen, well maintain'd their ground.His own true-levell'd shaft transfix'd the throatOf Larissean Thorax; who in dustBuries at length his Aleuadian pride.Rememb'ring all his charge bold Cimon rearsHis mighty spear. Impetuous through a bandOf yielding Phocians he on Theban ranksFalls like a rapid falcon, when his weightPrecipitates to strike the helpless prey.Him slaughter follows; slaughter from the rightOn Aeschylus attends, and mightier waitsOn Aristides. Justice in his breastAwhile was blind to mercy undeserv'd,Ev'n unimplor'd, by persevering foesInvet'rate. Now on this empurpled stageOf vengeance due to perfidy and crimes,Twice their own number had the Athenians heap'dOf massacred Boeotians; but as heav'n,Not to destruction punishing, restrainsIts anger just, and oft the harden'd spares,That time may soften, or that suff'rings past,Not measur'd full, may turn the dread of moreTo reformation; Aristides thus
Relenting bade retreat be sounded loud,Then, by th' obedient host surrounded, spakeSerene: Enough of Grecian blood is spilt,Ye men of Athens; low in dust are laidThe heads of those who plann'd the fall of Greece.The populace obtuse, resembling you,Enlighten'd people, as the sluggish beastA gen'rous courser, let your pity saveIn gratitude to Jove, creating yoursUnlike Boeotia's breed—Now form again.Thus equity and mercy he combin'd,Like that archangel, authoris'd by heav'nChief o'er celestial armies, when the fall'nFrom purity and faith in Eden's bow'rsNot to perdition nor despair he leftAbandon'd. Aristides still proceeds:New victories invite you; Sparta longHath wanted succour; Men of Athens, march.
Lo! Menalippus greets in rapid hasteThis more than hero. I am come, he said,To bring thee tidings of Mardonius slainIn open fight. Pausanias still demandsThy instant presence. In pursuit he reach'dThe stream. "Not now that passage is forbid,"Tisamenus exclaim'd. The gen'ral pass'dIn vain to force the well-defended camp;Repuls'd in ev'ry part he dubious standsWith disappointment fore; on Attic skillTo mount entrenchments and a rampart stormLaconians and Tegaeans both dependTo crown the day. Th' Athenian heard, and coolIn four divisions separates the host.Four thousand warriors, light and heavy-arm'd,Each part compose; whose ensigns o'er the floodIn order just are carry'd. He attainsTh' adjacent field, and joins Pausanias there;Whose ravell'd brow, and countenance of gloom
Present a lion's grimness, who, some fold,Or stall attempting, thence by vollied stonesOf trooping shepherds, and of herdsmen, chas'd,Hath sullenly retreated, though oppress'dBy famine dire. To Aristides spakeWith haughtiness redoubled Sparta's chief:Didst thou forget, Athenian, who commandsThe Grecian armies? Thou hast loiter'd longSince my two mandates. With majestic warmthThe righteous man: Pausanias, now receiveFrom Aristides language new, but just.Thine is the pride of satraps, not the lightIngenuous vanity of Greeks, from senseOf freedom, sense of cultivated minds,Above the rest of mortals. No; a black,Barbaric humour festers at thy heart,Portending usurpation. Know, proud man,Thou hast been weigh'd, and long deficient found
By Aristides, thy superior far,Then most superior, when for public goodCompliant most. Thou soon, O! Spartan born,Yet in thy country's decency untaught,Will like a Persian cast a loathing eyeOn freedom, on Lycurgus and his laws,Which gall a mind despotic. I presageThee dangerous, Pausanias. Where the seedsOf dark ambition I suspect, my eyeBecomes a jealous centinel; beware,Nor force my active vigilance to proofNow or in future, when united Greece,No more defensive, may retaliate war,Successful war, which prompts aspiring thoughts.Rest now a safe spectator. From defeatOf real warriors, of our fellow Greeks,Not Persians lightly arm'd in loose array,The loiterers of Athens shall with easeSurmount that fence impregnable to thee.To wait an answer he disdain'd, but march'd;While arrogance in secret gnash'd the teethOf this dark-minded Spartan, doom'd to proveThe boding words of Aristides true.The sun, no longer vertical, beganHis slant Hesperian progress. At the headOf his own host Cecropia's chief began.Enthusiastic flame, without whose aidThe soldier, patriot, and the bard is faint,At this great crisis thus inspires the manOf human race the most correct in mind:Ye shades of all, who tyrants have expell'd,Ye, who repose at Marathon entomb'd,Ye glorious victims, who exalt the nameOf Salamis, and Manes of the braveLeonidas, arise! Our banners fanWith your Elysian breath! Thou god supreme,
Jove elutherian, send thy child belov'd,With her Gorgonian aegis, to defendA people struggling not for spoil, or pow'r,Not to extend dominion, but maintainThe right of nature, thy peculiar giftTo dignify mankind. I lift this prayer,My citizens, in rev'rence, not in doubtOf your success. Ye vanquishers of Greeks,Beneath your spears yon servile herd will fall,As corn before the sickle. With a lookOf circumspection he remark'd a swellOf ground not fifty paces from the camp;Olympiodorus and his bowmen thereHe posted first. Now, Aeschylus, he said,Construct of solid shields a brazen roof;In contact close to yonder fence of woodForm like the tortoise in his massy shell.The archers, each like Phoebus skill'd, removeWith show'rs of death the thick defendants soon
Clear from the rampart, which in height surpass'dTwo cubits. Aeschylus not slow performsHis task. A rank of sixty warriors plac'dErect, with cov'ring bucklers o'er their heads,A brazen platform to the wall unites.The next in order stoop behind; the lastKneel firm on earth. O'er implicated shieldsA stable passage thus when Cimon sees,He mounts, and fearless eyes the Asian camp.Between the rampart's basis and the foeAn empty space observing, on the groundHis spear he fixes, and amidst a stormOf clatt'ring javelins, arrows, darts and stones,Swings down. So, shooting from the sulph'rous lapOf some dark-vested cloud, a globe of fireThrough winds and rain precipitates a blazeTerrific down the raven pall of night.His whole division follows; with his bandMyronides, and Aeschylus, releas'd
From his first care. Successively they range.The very fence, by Persian toil uprais'd,Now from the Persian multitude securesTh' Athenian near. No obstacle remainsTo Aristides, who compleats his plan.Olympiodorus and his active trainWith axes keen, and cleaving spades approach;Hewn down, uptorn in that surmounted part,The fall'n defences, and the levell'd ground,Soon leave an op'ning wide. His strong reserve,Eight thousand light, two thousand heavy-arm'd,With Haliartus, and Oileus' son,Cecropia's chief leads forward to sustainHis first bold warriors. Chileus enters nextWith his Tegaeans, Aemnestus brave,Pausanias, Amompharetus, the youthOf Menalippus, all the Spartan host.Seven Grecian myriads through the breach invadeA ground, with swarms of tents and men oppress'd.
Dire thus th' irruption of Germanic seasThrough strong Batavian mounds; th' inflated brineStupendous piles of long-resisting weightBears down, and, baffling strength and art combin'd,Foams o'er a country in its seat profoundBelow the surface of th' endang'ring main;A country, where frugality and toilNo spot leave waste, no meadow, but in herdsRedundant; where the num'rous dwellings shewSimplicity but plenty, now immers'dWith all their throng'd inhabitants beneathTh' unsparing deluge. Aristides swift,As if by gen'ral choice the chief supreme,Commandment issues, that to either sideThe host extend, that, skirted by the fence,With wheeling flanks in front the line assumeA crescent's figure. Thus the fisher skill'dWith his capacious seines, slow-dragg'd and press'd
Close on each bank, a river's whole expanseWith all his natives glossy-finn'd involves.Yet Mindarus, with Mede and Persian ranks,A large remainder from the morning fight,Resists, which soon are slaughter'd; he retreatsAmong the tents, whose multitude impedesThe Grecians. Aristides straight commands,That from the heavy line's disjointed lengthA hundred bands expatiate in the chaceOf foes benumb'd by fear, who neither fight,Nor fly, of means depriv'd. The carnage growsIn every quarter. Fountains seem unclos'd,Whence rivulets of blood o'erflow the ground.O'er satraps, potentates, and princes fall'n,Strode Aristides first of men, of heav'nThe imitator in his civil deeds,Now some faint semblance, far as mortal mayOf that Almighty victor on the field
Ethereal, when o'er helms, and helmed headsOf prostrate seraphim, and powers o'erthrown,He rode. Still Mindarus, by courage wing'd,From nation flies to nation, still persistsExhorting; though in hopeless thought he seesGreat Hyperanthes from the shades ascend,And seems to hear the godlike phantom sighIn mournful words like these: Ah! fruitless toil!As once was mine, to rescue from despairThe panic fears of Asia! Dead in mind,Her host already soon dead clay must lie,Like me on Oeta's rock. Yet Midias brave,With Tiridates rous'd, their efforts join.Against them warlike Medon, and the seedOf Lygdamis, chance brings. They side by side,As heretofore Thermopylae beheldYoung Dithyrambus and Diomedon,Had all the day their unresisted wedgeOf Locrian shields and Delphian led to deeds,
Accumulating trophies. Midias fallsBy Haliartus. From the slain his lanceRecov'ring, tow'rds his patron dear he turns;Him conqu'ror too of Tiridates viewsIn joy; joy soon to sorrow chang'd! Fate guidesA casual weapon from a distant hand;Such as at Ramoth from the Syrian bow,Drawn at a venture, smote between the jointsOf harness strong the Israelitish king,Who from the fight bade wheel his chariot, stain'dWith his own crimson. Ponderous and broadThe hostile lance inflicts a mortal woundIn Medon's gen'rous bosom. Not a sighHe breathes, in look still placid and sedate,While death's cold moisture stagnates on his limbs,By all their pow'rs forsaken. Bear, he saidTo Haliartus, bear me from the camp,Nor yet extract the weapon; life, I feel,Would follow swift, and Medon hath a charge
Yet to deliver. Some pathetic Muse,In tend'rest measures give these numbers flow!Let thine, who plaintive on the pontic vergeIn servitude Sarmatian, through her pageOf sorrows weeps thy banishment from Rome;Or thine, Euripides, whose moral strainsMelt sympathy in tears at human woes,Thy vary'd tragic themes, or both uniteYour inspiration to describe a heart,Where gratitude o'er all affections dearPredominantly sway'd; the faithful heartOf Haliartus at this sudden strokeOf direful chance. To death is Medon snatch'd,From glory snatch'd amid victorious friends.The Carian's bosom instant feels combin'dAchilles' anguish at Patroclus dead,The pang of Priam at the fall of Troy,Ev'n woman's grief, Andromache's distressFor her slain Hector, and his mother's pain
To see his mangled and dishonour'd corse.Great Artemisia's name, th' illustrious bloodFrom Lygdamis deriv'd, his own exploitsOf recent fame, are all eras'd from thoughtIn Haliartus now; who sinks againTo Meliboeus. On the wounded chief,As on his lord, his patron, still he looksWith all th' affection of a menial, bredIn the same home, and cherish'd in that homeWith lib'ral kindness to his humbler state.He clasps the fainting hero, on the shieldsOf weeping friends deposits, and conveysSwift through a portal, from its hinges forc'd.Three hours remain'd to Phoebus in his course.Close by the entrenchment, under beachen shadeOf ancient growth, a fountain bursts in rillsTransparent; thither on the down of mossWas Medon borne and laid. Unloose, he said,
My helm, and fill from that refreshing stream.Obey'd, he drank a part; then pouring downThe remnant, spake: By this libation clearBe testified my thanks to all the gods,That I have liv'd to see my country sav'dOn this victorious day. My fate requiresNo lamentation, Haliartus dear,Oh! more, than kindred, dear. Commend me firstTo Aristides; Medon's parting breathHim victor hails. To Delphi's virtuous priest,To my Leonteus, to the glorious sonOf Neocles, my salutation bear,To kind Cleander, my Troezenian host,To Hyacinthus of Euboea's race,The flower of all her chieftains: They have prov'dIn me some zeal their island to redeem.Transport my ashes to Melissa's care,Them near the reliques of Laconia's kingRepose; be mine the neighbour of his urn.Here with an utmost effort of his voice,With arms extended, and Elysian look:Leonidas, the life thy friendship sav'd,An off'ring to thy manes, now I closeMature in age, to glory not unknown,Above the wish, as destitute of hopeTo find a fairer time, or better cause,Than sends me now a messenger to greetThee with glad tidings of this land preserv'd.With his own hand the javelin from his breastHe draws serene; life issues through the wound.New shouts, new trumpets, waken from a tranceOf grief the son of Lygdamis. He seesCleander; who th' Asopian banks had pass'd,Call'd by Sicinus from Saturnia's dome.Lo! Epidaurian Clitophon, the ranks
Of Phlius with Menander, Sicyon's chiefAutomedon, the Hermionean spearsWith Lycus follow, Cephallene's sons,The Acarnanian, all th' Epirot bands,Leprēan Conon, with Mycenae's youthPolydamas, by Arimnestus ledThe brave Plataeans, with his Thespian filesAlcimedon, Nearcus with his forceOf Chalcis, Potidaean Tydeus next,Eretrian Cleon, Lampon, and the troopOf little Styra, Corinth's banners last,By Adimantus and Alcmaeon rang'd.Too late you come for glory, them bespakeThe Carian sad: Lo! half the foes destroy'dBy Aristides, fugitives the rest;Lo! there the only loss, which Greece sustains.To him Cleander, with devout regretO'er Medon, honour'd paranymph and guest,
His head inclining: Not too late we comeFor sacrifice of Persians to the ghostOf this dead hero. Ah! what floods of tearsWill fall in Troezen—But let grief prevailHereafter. Son of Lygdamis, renounceDespondency; Acanthè still survivesTo fire thy breast as Ariphilia mine;I hear her prompting my vindictive arm.From thy experience of this glorious dayLead thy Troezenian host, where best to pointHis strenuous efforts. Let thy guiding zealFor me, long cursing my inactive post,Yet find one track to fame. These gallant wordsOf cordial frankness from dejection liftThe Carian brave, not less than Phoebus cheer'dThe languid son of Priam on the bankOf Xanthus; when a stony mass, of weightTo stay a keel on Hellespontine sands,By Ajax hurl'd, benumb'd the Trojan's frame.Thus Haliartus: Through that open gate,New forc'd, the shortest, safest passage lies;But, to acquire some lustre, I can shewAnother track for prowess yet to shine.He leads, all follow, save Corinthian bandsWith Adimantus, hast'ning through the gate,Soon as to him th' intelligence is brought;Who ent'ring, sees a carnage which confoundsA timid spirit. By Alcmaeon urg'd,Close by the fence he marches; none he meetsBut fly before him. Adimantus liftsHis spear, and satiates cowardice with bloodOf unresisting men. By cheap successBetray'd, a distant quarter he attains,Where Mindarus confronts him. From his steedTh' unyielding satrap whirls a rapid lance,Which nails the base Corinthian to the ground.Alcmaeon next is wounded; more had bled,
But Aristides o'er that part, devoidOf tents, his dreadful crescent in arrayIs forming new. The Persian starts; he fliesTo one last angle of the spacious camp,Sole spot unforc'd. Half circled now in front,The Attic, Spartan, and Tegaean ranks,In motion slow, yet moving on, augmentProgressively their terrors, like a rangeOf clouds, which thicken on the brow of night,A final wreck portending to a fleet,Already shatter'd by the morning storm.Round Mindarus the remnant of his hostCollected still is numerous. Them he seesOft look behind, a sight that ill accordsWith warriors; but, as now in columns deepIts glitt'ring horns that direful crescent shewsWithin the limits of a javelin's cast,All turn intent on flight at large; they break
Their own inclosure down, whose late defenceIs present bane, and intercepts escape.Lo! Haliartus; all whose grief is chang'dTo fire, heroic flame. Three myriads freshHe pours; that crouded angle he invests,Preventing flight. Cleander looks aroundLike some tornado menacing a bark,Which soon unseam'd and parted sinks ingulph'd;He finds a breach and with him enters death.The long-enduring satrap, whose mild soulCalamity hath worn, resembles nowThe poor desponding sailor, who is leftLast of the found'ring vessel on a plankAlone. No coast appears; the greedy swellHe sees around, expecting ev'ry waveWill terminate his being, and forgoesAll hope of succour. His afflicted soulThus with an effort equal to his rank
The prince explores: What, Mindarus, remainsFor thee deserted! In another's homeCleora dwells, Masistius is no more;Slain is Mardonius, Asia's glory fall'n;Thou hast too long been fugitive this day;Like Teribazus close a term of woe;Like him in death be honour'd. He dismounts,He grasps a spear. Such dignity of shameTo Ilian Hector, from his flight recall'd,Great Homer's Muse imparted. While the princeIs meditating thus, a man sublimeTow'rs from th' Athenians, who suspend their march;Unlike the son of Peleus in his ireImplacable, he represents a godIn aspect, god of mercy, not of arms.Know, chieftain, he began, to me the GreeksOne Persian life have granted; it is thine.
In this day's trial I have noted wellThy constancy and manhood; I, who prizeThe gems of virtue, in whatever clime,O Persian! whether in a friend or foeTheir never-changing lustre they display;I, Aristides, my protecting armExtend. Time presses; yield thee, ere too late;Captivity no burden shalt thou find,Till safe, without a ransom, thou regainThy native seat. The Persian melts like snowIn all its rigour at the noon-tide sun.This unforeseen, humane demeanour calmsHis mind, and hushes ev'ry desp'rate thought.He thus replies: On all my actions pastHath fortune frown'd; perhaps a captive stateWith Aristides, whom Masistius lov'd,Mardonius prais'd, and all mankind reveres,Forebodes a change of fortune to my gain!
Thy condescending wisdom, O supremeIn justice, knowledge, and benignant deeds,May lift a man of sorrows from despair!He yields. Th' Athenian leads him through the pressSecure; himself a spectacle avoids,Which others covet. Lo! on ev'ry sideKeen swords of massacre are wav'd. To maidsDeflow'r'd, dishonour'd wives, and gods prophan'd,To Athens, Thespia, and Plataea burnt,The Greeks compleat their sacrifice. The sun,Wont on those fields of glist'ning green to smile,And trace Asopus through his crystal maze,Now setting, glances over lakes of blood;While fate with Persian carnage chafes the streamNo longer smooth and limpid, but o'erswoln,And foaming purple, with encreasing heaps
Of carcases and arms. Night drops her shadeOn thirty myriads slaughter'd. Thus thy death,Leonidas of Sparta, was aveng'd,Greece thus by Attic virtue was preserv'd.FINIS.ERRATA.B.
