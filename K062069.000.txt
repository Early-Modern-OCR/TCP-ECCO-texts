Bragg, at the Raven in Pater-Noster-Row. 1708.THE Seditious Insects, &c.NEAR the Cool Verge of that Delightful Strand,Where winding Thames rowls over Golden Sand,Where Western Breezes fan the Gentle Air,And Britain's brightest Ornaments appear,An Ancient Hive of Aristaean Bees,With pleasure swarm'd among the Fragrant Trees.Long did their Labours o'er the Land diffuseAerial Honey, and Ambrosial Dews,Collected from the Meads, and Rosie Bowers,And Morning Sweets, that tip the gaudy FlowersOf their gay Pride, despoiling every Plain,To feed with Heavenly Juice the humble Swain,And load with labour'd Sweets the flowing Land again.Safe was their Hive from all oppressive Harms,No Dreams of Danger discompos'd their Swarms;But fam'd for Peace and Order they were known,True Bees due Homage to Superiours own.This was their State, when busie Moths arose,And Wasps Insidious, equally their Foes.Hornets and Drones, and all the humming TribeWhom Hate cou'd Summon, or whom Int'rest Bribe.Gnats, Beetles, Locusts, all the Worthless kindOf hateful Insects in the Riot join'd,Buzzing false Dangers, and distracting Fears,In new Confusions now the Hive appears;
Customs unknown to Ages heretoforeCorrupt the Breed, the Virgin Race deflow'r.So when False Teachers in the Church arise,Schism prevails, and true Religion dies;Faith takes her flight, unable to sustainThe Mighty Shock, Reason perswades in vain;Till Heavenly Energy our Breast inspiresWith Sacred Sense of true Etherial Fires,Then the dark Clouds of Errour fly apace,And Revelation reassumes her Place.Now the warm Foe their Io Paeans sing,In every Vale loud Peals of Conquest ring;The painted Butterfly with empty Sound,Proclaim'd the gaudy Triumph all around;Every vile Insect to the Hive repairs,Foments the Tumult, and the Plunder Shares.Sated with Spoil, with Victory elate,The Hostile Vermine whet their pointed Hate:Each Envious Thought they sooth, and proudly driveThe Bees dejected from the Luscious Hive;When their Just King touch'd with a Princely Zeal,To save his Subjects, and their Pressures heal,Gives up the Councellors who ill-advis'd,And their Immoderate Enterprize chastis'd,Another Set of Ministers he chose,And freed the Hive from their Vexatious Foes.With Rays of Heavenly Light returning PeaceSmil'd on the Great Design, and Crown'd it with Success;Such is the Power of Majesty Divine,When in full Lustre it vouchsafes to shine.
The Rebel Brood struck with amazing Dread,In trembling Horror and Confusion fled.So have the Zealots of our Church appear'd,(If Little Things may be with Great Compar'd,)Busie with specious Dangers to amuse,With Patriots Fears the Populace abuse,When 'twas the Churches Honey rais'd the Cry,Join'd with the Sweetness of the Ministry.Had they still loll'd in Soft Luxurious Ease,The Church had flourish'd in Triumphant Peace,The Synods too been Safe, secure from Harm,(Tho' even in them some Holy Vermin swarm:)O say, Bright Goddess, whence this Temper flows,And show how first the Fatal Schism rose.Long has the Papal Power aspir'd to reignWith Universal sway: Why will they strive in vain?Some Angel still by a Divine CommandWill interpose to save the British Land.Successive Plots, and Jesuitick Wiles,Open Attempts, and seeming Friendly Smiles,Have in their Turns, with the same vile Intent,Contriv'd the Ruin of this Government.This to promote, some Fathers heretoforeLavish of Labour, prodigal of Gore,Fain wou'd their Hands in Royal Blood imbrue,And bless'd the Deed as Meritorious too,Since the Libation to the Church was due.This Sainted Herd, this Vile, Deceiving Race,Now in Rich Fresco at See Mr. Addison's Remarks on Italy,Loretto blaze;
Where Speaking Marble do's their Story tell,This for the Faith, that for Religion fell;When for the worst of Crimes the Hellish Breed,Did by the Justest Law of Nations Bleed.Such Saints as These England too much has known,Who Clemens and Ravilliac's Maxims own;King-killing Doctrines, and Deposing Crowns,Too oft have been the Theme of Servile Gowns.Peters and Ferguson may surely claimA Share with Garnet in Immortal Fame.Lacy and Marion too in time may vieWith either kind for Gifts and Prophecy;The same Seditious Spirit forms their WillFor Mischief, Arm'd alike with Blind Ungovern'd Zeal.Whole Ages have such Emissaries try'd,This much too fickle Nation to divideWith open Violence. In Eighty-eightThey lead their easie King, and rid the yielding State.Law fell before their Arbitrary Sway,And now they Smil'd, and Bless'd the Happy Day,When British Liberty no more shou'd standIn opposition to Supream Command.Thus were we crush'd by the Intrigues of Rome,Till Glorious Nassau had revers'd our Doom;He came to save us with extended Arms,Restore our Laws, and break the Tyrants Charms,Rescue the Church from her insulting Foes,And leave the Nation in a Blest Repose;This done, he fled to his Congenial Sphere,And shines upon the Land a Bright Auspicious Star.
Forgive, Immortal Hero, if my Muse,Conscious of Weakness, her own Theme pursues,Nor aims to Praise so Excellent a King,None but a Virgil shou'd a Caesar Sing.With Mortal Pangs they saw the Romish YokeThus by our Happy Revolution brokeBy open force; despairing to succeed,On New Designs their Factious Agents leadVarious Intrigues, their Cursed Engines try,No Difficulties daunt their Industry,But what the Sword denies they attempt by Prophecy.Earth, Hell, and Seas, they'll compass to deceive,And Glory in the Toil if Proselites believe.So when Imperial Juno had implor'dThe Thunderer's Aid to crush the Trojan Lord,The Awful God denying her Request,Told her, Aeneas must in Latium rest;But she Impatient, by strong Passion mov'd,(So much a Female Jesuit she prov'd)Besought the Powers beneath to be her Friends,And went to Hell to gain her Pious Ends.Sure 'twas from thence this Gifted Spirit came,No Heavenly Fire, but an Infernal Flame,Design'd by Jesuits to destroy Our Ease,And pall the Joys of our United Peace.For this, Seditious Spirits in disguiseSwarm in the Church, tho' they that Church despise:
Loudly they boast her Ancient Rights and Fame,Whilst underhand they play a Popish Game.The Seed of Loyold with Artful PainsFirst fixt this High-Church Poyson in our Veins,Infecting too too many of our Youth,Who, blindly led, fell from the Cause of Truth.Isis no more can boast of healing Streams,The Deity has long withdrawn his Beams;Displeas'd that they polluted his Abode,That High-Church Victims now his Altars load,And Priests no Incense offer worthy of a God.Hence we derive the Cause of all our Woes,From hence the Dangers of the Church arose;Hence empty Libertines with Modish Air,At Myst'ry laugh, and all Religion jeer;When Fountains are corrupt, how can the Streams be clear?So when at Athens the Degenerate RaceLeft their old Morals, new Ones to Embrace,The Guardian Deities their Shrines forsook,In vain the Victims on their Altars smoak;In vain the Fragrant Gums in Spheres ascend,Th'unhallow'd Incense did but more offend:Then Highflown Priests their new Distinctions brought,And Faction for Religion first was taught;Then Piety and Ancient Faith decay'd,And Synod-Men the Churches Right betray'd;Then Vice and Vertue were in Schools defin'd,As the Declaiming Stagyrite inclin'd;But Truth abandon'd did in Secret Mourn,And begg'd the Blooming Goddess to return.
O say, Celestial Muse, the Reason tell,Why in those Heavenly Men such Passions dwell?Why those who preach Religion, Zeal profess,And for the Church such Flaming Love confess,Shall in vile Terms of their Superiors speak,Slight their Authority, their Orders break;In open Disobedience live, and rail,And hope by Innovations to prevail,With Intermediate Sessions, why confoundThe Churches Peace, the Convocation wound?By Rights Usurp'd why Presbyters prepareTheir Primate's Power without Consent to share,And fill without his leave the Prolocutor's Chair?Why to their Members they pretend to giveCommissions to absent? Why grant 'em leave,And by what Right, with what assuming Face,They substitute their Proxies in their Place?Why Actuaries they chose? But with intentT'infringe the Power of their President,Whose most Undoubted Right 'thas always beenAs well for to Prorogue as to Convene.T'appoint his Register, of Deputation,To act in either House or Convocation.And why such grateful Thoughts these Men retain,Of the Transcendent Mildness of this Reign,So warmly to oppose the Lords Address, The Bishops Address of Thanks refused by the Lower-House.Where in the Humblest Terms they did expressTheir Thanks to Heaven for that Illustrious Queen,In whom such Wondrous Piety is seen;
Whose unexampled Bounty has declar'dHow much the Churches Welfare she rever'd;Such true diffusive Charity revealsWhat Sense of Goodness in her Soul she feels.A Charity which in its Nature shewsHeaven for its Birth-place, where it first arose,From whence descending to her Royal Breast,The Radiant Virtue Kind'red Flames Confest,And own'd the Bright Abode, worthy the Godlike Guest.For me, the first Desire which does ControulThe Secret Springs which move my rising SoulIs, that her Glorious Reign I might rehearseIn equal Numbers, and distinguish'd Verse.But far, O far above the Poet's FlameIs her Bright Story, and Immortal Name.Cou'd I, like Hx, in lasting StrainsTranscend the Mantuan or Moeonian Swains,Then shou'd her more than Mortal Vertue shine,And Heavenly Eloquence adorn each Line;Then shou'd my Happy Muse record her Fame,And ANNA's Glory be my endless Theme;But whether does the Ravish'd Muse Aspire?Not Phoebus boasts a more exalted Fire,Or touches with more Art the sweetly sounding Lyre.In vain our Monarch labours to engage,With all her Clemency, these Men of Rage,Who their Defect of Duty wou'd supply,By wrangling for their Independency.
Who without Precedent insist to useForms of their own, and their own Methods chuse;Tho' former Synods always in like CaseComply'd with the Directions of his Grace,And Suffragans; but these too Wise are grownT'acknowledge Duty, or Dependance own:These claim a Right Co-ordinate with theirs,And Model as they please the Church Affairs.So Puritans of Old in the same Strain,Did of the Bishops Legal Pow'r complain.A Presbyterian Parity they taught,In the same Language which by these is brought,To vindicate the Lower House's Claim,By Advocates of the same Strength and Fame.This Levelling Contention to promote,Full many then, as well as now, have wrote,Tho' none with more Asperity appearsThan Gifted Urim, void of Filial Fears;He treats the Bishops with the same regard,As if he for Presbytery declar'd.Such foul Mistakes, such groundless Calumnies,Occur in all this Vide Bed-maker University. Sun-burnt Author says,That Charity apart, one might believeHe did from Hell his Influence receive.With Scorn of others, full of Self-conceit,This Scribler undertook the Grand Debate,Misrepresenting every thing that madeAgainst his Cause, and did with Art evadeThe Force of Truth, as if deceiving was his Trade.Thus to his Cause he Courted Partial Praise,With all the Sophistry his Wit cou'd raise.
But whilst his Eloquence profusely Toils,Old Anarchy reviews his former Spoils,Pleas'd with the Thought the Shapeless Monster Smiles.Here the Episcopate in mournful hueAppears, there falling Mitres strike the view.For this Incestuous Twigg in Zealous StrainsOf President and Upper-House complains,Quarrels with Bishops Rights and Dignities,Since the Coy Lawn his fond Embraces flies.For this Bold Bs in that dark Orb declaims,He both the Church and Churches Head Blasphemes;No Sense of Piety or Grace restrainThe Heterodox Effusions of his Brain,Who for his Party sticks at no Abuse,But for the Cause will even his A 30th of January Sermon, where he lessens Christ to extol the Martyr. God traduce.Elaborate H with the same IntentEngages in this weighty Argument:But of Bright Truth afraid, he soon retreats,Still safe behind some puzzling Theme he gets,Where in round Periods, and Sonorous Words,A Barren Entertainment he affords.No Cogent Reas'nings in his Thoughts abound,His Sense in Fairy Circles dances round,And never is without some Labour found.Nay, tho' the M dignifies his Brows,He still their Levelling Designs avows.With flagrant Marks of most Irreverend SpleenLoose Sn is in his Letter seen.There Inbred Calumny, and Native Spight,Wrangle by turns for Lower-House's Right;There High-Church Zeal defends Fanatick Claim,Soft'ning Sedition by a milder Name,To save the Church with Scorn her Fathers Treats,Such Rage of Schism in his Bosom beats.So Patriots of old, to save the Crown,Destroy'd its Power first, then pull'd their Sovereign down.Against Conviction, and the clearest LightOf Sacred Truth, did railing Nm writeWith Artificial Strokes of Party Skill,He gilds their Errors with the Name of Zeal,And the deluded Herd believe the lying Oracle.To such mean Shifts those Scribblers must descend,Who an ill Cause avowedly defend.Among these Champions A too appearsWith Vide Oxford Alman. 1706.Hieroglyphics of the Parties Fears;No wonder they the Church's Danger see,Who wou'd destroy the Church's Polity;Pull down her Bishops, and their Rights betray,And modelize the Church the shortest Way.What wou'd the Parliament of Forty-oneHave given for such a Convocation?
Such Levellers as these, such Sons of Zeal,Sure at that time must have succeeded well,When every Schismatick and gifted Saint,Who cry'd down Bishops Pow'r in sawcy Cant,Found such Rewards, and such Encouragement.Wise Against Episcopacy and Church Discipline.Pennington's Petition had appear'dMore Just, if Presbyters, like these, had shar'dIn the Church Hierarchy with less Disgrace,Sacred Episcopists had yeilded PlaceT' Inferiour Clergy of Reforming Race.These are the Insects which the Hive infest,And these give Life and Motion to the rest.Numerous Meetings of the lesser FryTake Influence from these to raise the CryOf Danger to the Church from too assuming Prelacy.Not far from that most Celebrated Hall,Where the Rich Trophies of the Conquer'd Gaul,The Glory of the British Host display,And show the Wonders of that dreadful Day,When Marlbro' great in Arms the Foe subdu'd,And stopp'd with Heaps of Slain the rowling Danube's Flood.There stands a Dome,Bell-Tavern, King-Street, Westminster. as Modern Stories tell,Distinguish'd from its Neighbours by a Bell;There the A Club of Priests, so called. Grand Inquest of Religion meet,To forge new Scandals for the Church and State.
Thither the Tippling Priesthood flock in Shoals,And leave to Heaven the trifling Care of Souls.'Tis there the Tories find out Means to raiseFunds of Reproach, Volumes of Lying Lays,T'asperse the Queen, the Ministry disgrace;Whilst their own Peers of a distinguish'd Name,Their B's, and R's, and N's, of Recent Fame,Promote the Farce, and Glory in their Shame.There the Irreverend Sots their Goblets Crown,And in full Bowls all Moderation drown.A Cast there is from this Mellifluous Swarm,Who Nightly meet their Principles to warm,Where Bloated Bacchus in gay Triumph rides,And Shuth provokes Salacious Tides;Hither the High-Church Vermin do retreat,For where but at the Devil shou'd they meet?Drunk with Priest Wine new Dangers they perceive,And for the Church in strong Gallicia grieve.To rail secure, and fence against Alarms,They shift and vary their industrious Swarms;Now the ThreeShuth and her Two Daughters, so called.Conies-Court, and then the Royal Arms.Where Beny Brews with Lusitanic PortTrue English Redstreak, thither they resort,And warm with Zeal perceive not the Abuse,But for true French mistake the blended Juice;There mock Committees judge of each Debate,And Convocation Bus'ness regulate.There florid S in strong Oration showsHow far the Lower-House the Upper may oppose;With early Zeal he did their Cause embrace,And in this Session claims the Chair-man's Place.Sure some Malicious Star, an Enemy to Peace,Shone o'er his Head when first he join'd with these;Too strong for the Bright Rays of Truth or Sense,Virtue Innate, or Seyr's Influence,To hinder his Conjunction with that Crew,Who seek to ruin Church and Nation too;His solid Judgment want of heat Supplies,And speaks him only Tory in disguise.Hn next in the Black List appears,This Butter-flie a sullen Aspect wears;No Saints his Gloomy Calenders contain,But such as of the sinking Church complain.The Tack he vindicates in Sensless Tone,Do's none but Tories for true Patriots own,And is in Church Disputes a meer pretending Drone.The next Vile Insect of the High-Church ClanSays Grace to Northern Metropolitan;He from his Lord whole Paragraphs purloins,And mingles Nonsence with most Reverend Lines;Roars for the Church, Triumphant in his Drink,But rarely, very rarely, condescends to think.Dg, a Wasp of the same Shape and Hue,To Passive Principles and High-Church true,Comes next in Place, tho' higher in Degree,This Reverend Thing subscribes himself D. D.
He for Dragooning Learnedly declares,Such Zeal for Mother-Church this flutt'ring Insect bears.Nor Sh for Plagiary is accus'd in vain,A Furious Bigot of the Tory Strain;He knows to value Oaths far less than Gold,And how both VVife and Fellowship to hold;VVho lest the Church shou'd think, as Bards report,VVill make the Play-house work for its Support.O! Collier lay aside thy Manly Rage,Since thy own Priests in Buskins tread the Stage,To raise dejected Merit, and maintainThe Grandeur of the Church without a stain,That Gold for Injur'd Rights no more atone,Be these peculiar to the Whigs alone.VVell-natur'd Pein I lament thy Fate,Mistaken Reas'ning prompted thee to hateThat Moderation which adorns the Mind,And what alone in Modern Whigs we find;High-Church apart thy Character is fair,Thou hast no other Fault but being there.To this The Common Regale at Bently's.Grand Oatcake Club of quaint Divines,Gross Rn his Guts and Malice joins;A Greezy Ionian of Amphibious Breed,VVho can for Gain with any Party lead;But in his Nature opposite to thoseVVho healing Peace and Unity espouse;
All the Extreams of the vile Tory Brood,In him conjoin, with no Alloy of Good.To him alike all Languages are known,VVith the same Truth he understands his own;This Paedagogue lives undisturb'd by Cares,Nor minds the Widows Tears nor Orphans Pray'rs,But rakes for Money for Foundation Boys,Which he for Coals and Candles ends employs,VVhilst he poor Man but Five Pluralities enjoys.Unknown in Morals, Character, and Fame,To the Great Founder, of Illustrious Name,VVhose Boundless Charity, and High Deserts,He Impiously Lessens, and perverts.Of Irish Extract, and Hibernian Sence,(Qualifications for an Evidence,)R Supercilious, Haughty, Dull, Morose,Do's to the Board his Genuine Thoughts disclose;So burning is his Zeal, that he declaresThe Government too moderate appearsTo those who from his Principles dissent,Such Smithfield shou'd convert, and not the Parliament.Jn a Locust of the Factious League,For Birth and Learning fam'd as his Collegue,He Pray'rs and Preaching primitively blames,And against Priestly Offices declaims;Unhappy Barthol'mew, who must confideIn the loose Notions of this wand'ring Guide,VVhom neither Goodness, Chastity, nor PeaceAdorn, nor any other Christian Grace;Td a Priest or Bishop, which you please,Loose in his Morals, stiff in his Address,Do's both the Club and Principles Caress.From Tweed to Roterdam this Hornet shines,And for the Cause in Florid Fustian whines.In this Cabal all Vices you may trace,Or in it Or had found no place;If lying qualifies, or ardent LoveFor Pious Theft, none can a better Title prove.Arrowsmith's Sermon Preach'd before the May'r,To Plagiary his Aversion must declare;This Zealot to the Tory's High-Priest bows,And offers up at F all his Vows;The Solid B smiles on his Address,And in Propitious Dulness does him Bless;Conceited H with Melancholly Mien,Adds to the Club his Piety and Spleen;But both affected, both uneasy sit,For that can boast no Truth, and this no Wit.Firm to the Cause, he wou'd at something aim,Tho' strong in Zeal, he's in Performance lame;And after all his Pious Pains are o'er,Tho' Lady Fge his Fate deplore,He's but the same dull Mortal that he was before.If Arduous Spight, and most obdurate Hate,To that Dear Name which must be ever Great,
Weigh with this Club, none can more justly claim,Than Fn a Patent to defame.This Debauchee, as Play-house Annals say,Ply'd at the Theatre in hopes of Pay,But proving there too awkard to succeed,Finding his Genius did to Action lead,He Listed in the Service of High-church,And left his pompous Buskins in the Lurch.With these the Lds too demand a Place,Two drowzy Beetles of the Tory Race;Both of our Modern Dangers were appriz'd,And at the falling Church seem'd much surpriz'd;They thought the Lords too Fearless and Supine,And with Tripe Higgons at her Ease repine.These Grand Intrigues most Zealous to assist,Dn's appears a vile traducing Priest;His Fruitful Malice pleasingly beguilesTheir Cares, on him the Black Assembly smiles,Whilst Tenn and William he reviles.When Oy has his yawning Flock dismiss'd,And from her Pain St. Peggy is releas'd,This Mortal mounts a second time on high,Once more the Sacred Text to crucifie.He from the Scriptures evidently proves,The Modern Church on a false Axis moves;Says she's to blame to tolerate her Foes,That Persecution better wou'd composeThe Wavering Minds of her Rebellious Sons,If once convinc'd by Orthodox Dragoons.These are the Club who for the Church appear,And for her Discipline and Rights declare;No Blemishes their Characters distain,No Private Piques, no Sordid Hopes of Gain,Corrupt the Dictates of their Sounder Sense,Who act from Tory Principle and Influence.Besides these constant Members there are someWho casual Volunteers do thither come;Ttt and lovely Gtt both have been,Tho' not of late, with these Reformers seen.Nature Rebels when Int'rest comes in play,And Principles to stronger Tithes give way.Some too there are whom Penury detersFrom being in this Harvest Labourers;Not that they want foul Slanders to defameAnd brand the Ministers with Marks of Shame.Fruitful in Impudence they still are found,And with their Parties Villany abound;Skilbec, and Pr Shw, and Thousands more,Too Black for Honest Satyr to explore.Others with Griping Avarice repleat,In viler Liquors one another treat;These frugal Sinners can supinely rail,As warm'd by muddy Influence of Ale. Cross-Keys St. Martin's-Lane.On clumsy Wings their feeble Spirits rise,Before 'em hated Moderation flies,And base Detraction want of Wit supplies.
Here Fd and Br of Noisie Fame,With Hotspur Fn for the Church declaim,And sink her Credit to exalt her Name.Here St and Kys do for the High-Church lye,Damnation drink to Nassau's Memory,O Sparg have a Care of such vile Company.Some not admitted, qualified appearTo taste the Sweetness of this High-Church Fare;Thrifty and Gripewell an Insipid Drone,Do both the Spirit of the Party own;Their Pious Spight and Sordid Thirst of Gain,Betray their Patron's Temper in each Vein;Unlike the happy St. Martyn. Saint whose Arms they bear,No part of Cloak or Money will they spare.Such Zeal for Perquisites of every kindDwells in the secret Foldings of their Mind,That those The Under Officers of the Church. who Scorn their Profits to divide,Still feel the Weight of their Oppressive Pride.Gripewell in plenty rowls, deep sunk in Ease,He leaves his Drudgery to Refugees.Long have they been of that Tenacious Fry,Who for Exaction even with Jews may vie,Oppressing all who are beneath their Care,So Gripewell does the Gain, Thrifty the Odium share.They wisely know that to be Rich in GraceThey frugally must manage their Increase,And make the most they can of Curates Place.
Such Evangelic Doctrines they disclose,That Scar'd Communicants forsake their Vows,Forc'd by these Vermin from the Face of Day,Their Minds in wild Imaginations stray,And in the Maze of Error lose their Way.With these Divines Pert Hd may sitIn close Debate, a Vain Sarcastic Wit!He threw of Moderation's easie Rule,Impatient to expose a High-Church Fool,In flaming Print the Wou'd-be-Wit appears,Thund'ring loud Peals in Peaceful Hey's Ears.But whilst with noisie Eloquence he roars,And Hells Abyss for Scandal he explores,Bright Liberty her Sacred Pinnions tries,The Saint confess'd the Glory of her Eyes,Drops his Design, and in a Sarcasm dies.To close the Rear of this Highflying List,Comes Ghostly M the Cambridge Exorcist.He in the Cause has so much Heat exprest,He scarce with more his Landlady carest,When from the Tunns she Nightly did repair,To taste the Sweetness of St. Btts Air:But now those mean Embraces are no more,His Am'rous Soul do's more Sublimely soar,And tho' of High-Church Make can stoop to Cr's Pow'r.These of Inferiour Class which those combine,And in the Convocation Riot join.These Sow Sedition in the Peaceful Land,And in the Gap of Comprehension stand.
Such Priests as these Embarass our Affairs,And fill the giddy Populace with Fears;Divide and Rule their Grand Apostle cries,Then Liberty shall fall, and High-Church Power rise.But all are not of this Degenerate Race,Some Noble Prelates their Religion Grace,Whom no Sinister Aims, or Party Spleen,Cou'd ever Bribe the Church to undermine.No Popular Attempts prevail with these,Who most sincerely cultivate her Peace,Those vile destructive Measures to pursue,Which would infallibly the Church undo.They saw with Horror what her Foes design'd,And for her Ancient Legal Right combin'd,With all those vast Advantages to Sence,Which Truth can furnish out for Eloquence.Judicious Linn for his Worth Renown'd,With Piety, and every Vertue Crown'd,In this Dispute acquir'd a Bright Applause,And well defended his Illustrious Cause.Couragious Carle his distinguish'd Parts,And finish'd Learning to the Cause imparts;The routed Argument before him flies,And in its Primitive Confusion dies;Urg'd by strong Principles of Truth and Right,Illumin'd Frn did with Judgment write,To crush the growing Schism which might tendTo sink the State, and Church Dominion end.
But he to save 'em push'd his just DesignAnd with him Fifty more in Protestation join.That Presbyters Subordination oweTo Bishops, Sk did most plainly show,And Learnedly their Danger did disclose,Who held the Doctrines of the Lower-House.Trimll for Innate Piety rever'd,Against these furious Levellers declar'd;With unaffected Modesty and Sense,He prov'd the Primate's just Preheminence.Gibn with Oratories pleasing Force,With Streams deriv'd from the Immortal SourceOf Heaven and Lambeth, zealously maintain'dTh'Archbishop's Pow'r, and Reputation gain'd.Learn'd in Church History, and Ancient UseOf former Synods, Kent did deduceThe Metropolitan's presiding Place,And prov'd it with Inimitable Grace.Full of the same most Excellent Design,Pathetic Wills in a Strain Divine,Shews Ephraim how he may lost Peace restore,And envy Judah's happy Race no more.With what Excess of Joy does Verny treadThe Heavenly Paths of Peace, no Guilty dreadCan interrupt his Ease, no Black remorseStains with ungovern'd Zeal his Learned Course.Not melting Lovers when the Fair they WooeTaste more Delight, nor with more Sweetness Sue,Than these, when for the Churches Peace they moveWith all the soft Artillery of Love.Besides these Glorious Few, a num'rous TrainOf Worthy Prelates the same Cause maintain;Intrepid Sam, Norh all Divine,Ey and Worr with true Lustre shine.Oxd St. A Covy appear,With Rays of Heavenly Light serenely clear;Banr and Wm's, Herd all claim,With Bll and Peth dear to Fame,Among the Worthies of the Church a Name.Glr and Bll eminently true,With Lanff, Winr old Faith renew,And the just Int'rest of the Church pursue.These all in strict Obedience persevere,And for the Queen's Supremacy declare;These no Delusions ever cou'd perswade,To join with those who have her Right betray'd.Long her Resentment glow'd within her Breast,And long her Mercy her just Rage deprest;Even now in mildest Terms Queen's Letter to the Archbishop. her Letter claimsHer Legal Right, 'tis with Concern she blames,Her Priests, and with Regret their Disobedience Names.With deepest Penetration she beheldTheir vile Designs, nor Force by Force repell'd,
But in a Charming Stile, with Heavenly Love,The Lower House's Schism do's reprove.But they regardless of her Dread Command,In Opposition to her Pleasure stand;And tho' prorogu'd, her Mandates disobey,And meet and act their own Seditious Way.No wonder they have in Rebellion beenAgainst their Primate, who thus slight the Queen;That Glorious Queen, who freely from the ThroneHas given such large Revenues of her own,And to these Thankless Priests such true Compassion shown.So when the Wanton Isra'lites Rebell'dAgainst their Heavenly Guide in Horeb's Field;Nor did his Piety or Gifts avail,Th'Ungrateful Levites vehemently rail;Sated with Food Divine which Manna cloy'd,They murmur at the Blessings they enjoy'd;Forgetting all their Mighty Prophets Pain,Of Pow'r assum'd the Factious Herd complain,And Aaron's Legal Right invidiously Arraign.Pleas'd with a Cause his Primate to oppose,Seditious Korah and his Tribe arose;Rights of the Hebrew Temple they diffuse,To raise Rebellion, and they Church traduce;To lessen Aaron, whom with Scorn they treat,So near did Jewish Spight resemble High-Church Hate,Aspiring Dathan's Soul, and On's, we seeFlaming in Pious B's and K,And Hot Abiram's Zeal betrays poor A
These Modern Levellers like those Renown'd,Thro' our Blest Aaron's Sides the Temple wound,And on pretence of Rights her Sacred Peace confound.By such as these the Church in every AgeHas felt the sad Effects of Party Rage;But Heaven which always smil'd on her Bright Fame,And look'd with Pity on the suff'ring Dame,Has rais'd up Hero's to assert her Cause,And rouze the Terror of Vindictive Laws,T'avenge her Injur'd Honour upon thoseWho dare Insinuate her lost Repose.Begin Coelestial Muse the pleasing Strain,Record the Hero's of Great ANNA's Reign,By whose Unerring Councils she endearsHer Peoples Love, and Europe's Fate declares.Harmonious Cor sing in Lays Divine,By whose Bright Virtue Courts of Justice shine;Such are the Charms of his Immortal Sence,Union succeeds, and Happy Days Commence,And Equity receives from him its Influence.But Oh! What Numbers shall the Sprightly Muse,Equal to Great Godn's Wisdom chuse?What Happy Strains his Management disclose,Ador'd by Friends, and even rever'd by Foes?Too weak alas is her aspiring FlameTo praise such Worth, such Merit to proclaim,Such Scenes of Glory open to her view,She's lost in Thought, yet urges to pursue.O Charming Adn, the Theme is thine,The Subject as the Poet is Divine.
Thy Strength of Reason, sweetly flowing Verse,Alone are fit Great Spr to rehearse;To paint the Graces of that Godlike Mind,Where Judgment is with strictest Honour join'd,And every Thought to Britain's Peace consign'd.Your Sense Sublime it is, which must relateHow Sors, Hax Divinely GreatAppear, like Guardian Angels of the British State.How they in every Art and Council join,How wake for our Support, for our Defence combine.A Muse like yours Superiour to the Nine,Alone is equal to the vast Design.A Radiant List of Worthies I behold,Whose Powerful Hands the Fate of Albion hold,Whose Resolutions terminate in Law,Peace to Preserve, and Rebels keep in Awe.Among the Brightest of this Godlike Race,A Heavenly Prelate stor'd with every GraceAppears, Coelestial Peace and LoveThro' every Scene of his Bright Actions move;In him true Piety and Zeal we find,A Nervous Judgment and Sweet Temper join'd,The Ornament and Joy of Church and State,The Jesuits Terrour, and the Tories Hate.The Best of Kings by Light from Heaven inspir'd,And with just Ardour of his Vertue fir'd,This Best of Bishops to the Temple gave,To vanquish Errour, true Religion save,To fix her Throne secure on lasting Peace,Till Time shall fail, and rowling Ages cease;
That no Attempts from Factious Priests or RomeMight interrupt her Happiness to come.For this his Enemies revile his Fame,And load with Slander his Immortal Name;But he at Peace within sedately bearsTheir Hate, and unconcern'd their Malice hears.No gath'ring Clouds of Thunder yet appear,Nor more amazing Premunire's scare;No Censures interrupt the soft ReposeOf his Rebellious and Insulting Foes;Like the Good Queen he all Forgiveness seems,And the foul Rancour of their Spight contemns.So when his Glorious Master was abus'dBy railing Jews, by their High-Church traduc'd,Mildly he did their Insolence reprove,For Murd'rous Hate he show'r'd down Heavenly Love,And Healing Moderation from above.FINIS.
