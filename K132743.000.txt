THE TRAGEDY OF SOPHONISBA. Acted at the THEATRE-ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE. By His MAJESTY'S Servants.By Mr. THOMSON.LONDON: Printed for A. MILLAR, at Buchanan's Head, over-against St. Clement's Church in the Strand. M DCC XXX.TO THE QUEEN.MADAM,THE notice, Your MAJESTY has condescended to take of the following Tragedy, emboldens me to lay it, in the humblest manner, at Your MAJESTY'S Feet. And to whom can this illustrious Carthaginian so properly fly for protection, as to a QUEEN, who commands the hearts of a People, more powerful at sea than Carthage? more flourishing in commerce than those first Merchants? more secure against conquest? and, under a
Monarchy, more free than a Commonwealth itself?I dare not, nor indeed need I, here attempt a character, where both the great and the amiable Qualities shine forth in full perfection. All words are faint to speak what is universally felt, and acknowledged, by a happy people. Permit me therefore only to subscribe my self, with the truest zeal and veneration,MADAM,Your MAJESTY'S Most humble, Most dutiful, And most devoted Servant, JAMES THOMSON.PREFACE.IT is not my intention, in this preface, to defend any faults that may be found in the following piece. I am afraid there are too many: But those who are best able to discover, will be most ready to pardon them. They alone know how difficult an undertaking the writing of a tragedy is: and this is a first attempt.I beg leave only to mention the reason that determined me to make choice of this subject. What pleased me particularly, tho' perhaps it will not be least liable to objection with ordinary readers, was the great simplicity of the story. It is one, regular, and uniform, not charged with a multiplicity of incidents, and yet affording several revolutions of fortune; by which the passions may be excited, varied, and driven to their full tumult of emotionThis unity of design was always sought after, and admired by the antients: and the most eminent among the moderns, who understood their writings, have chosen to imitate them in this, from an intire conviction that the reason of it must hold good in all ages. And here allow me to translate a passage from the celebrated Monsieur Racine, which contains all that I have to say on this head.We must not fancy that this rule has no other foundation but the caprice of those who made it. Nothing can touch us in tragedy, but what is probable. And what probability is there, that, in one Day, should happen a multitude of things, which could scarce happen in several Weeks? There are some wh think that this simplicity is a mark of barrenness  invention. But they do not consider, that, on the

contrary, invention consists in making something out of nothing: and that this huddle of incidents has always been the refuge of poets, who did not find in their genius either richness or force enough to engage their spectators, for five acts together, by a simple action, supported by the violence of passions, the beauty of sentiments, and the nobleness of expression.—I would not be understood to mean that all these things are to be found in my performance: I only shew the reader what I aimed at, and how I would have pleased him, had it been in my power.As to the character of Sophonisba; in drawing it, I have confined myself to the truth of history. It were an affront to the age, to suppose such a character out of nature; especially in a country which has produced so many great examples of public spirit and heroic virtues, even in the softer sex: and I had destroyed her character intirely, had I not marked it with that strong love to her country, disdain of servitude, and inborn aversion to the Romans, by which all historians have distinguished her. Nor ought her marrying Masinissa, while her former husband was still alive, to be reckoned a blemish in her character. For, by the laws both of Rome and Carthage, the captivity of the husband dissolved the marriage of course; as among us impotence, or adultery: not to mention the reasons of a moral and public nature, which I have put into her own mouth in the scene betwixt her and Syphax.This is all I have to say of the play itself. But I cannot conclude without owning my obligations to those concerned in the representation. They have indeed done me more than justice. Whatever was designed as amiable and engaging in Masinissa shines out in Mr. Wilks's action. Mrs. Oldfield, in the character of Sophonisba, has excelled what, even in the fondness of an author, I could either wish or imagine. The grace, dignity, and happy variety of her action have been universally applauded, and are truly admirable.PROLOGUE.By a FRIEND.Spoken by Mr. WILLIAMS.WHEN learning, after the long Gothic night,Fair, o'er the western world, renew'd his light,With arts arising Sophonisba rose:The tragic muse, returning, wept her woes.With her th' Italian scene first learnt to glow;And the first tears for her were taught to flow.Her charms the Gallic muses next inspir'd:Corneille himself saw, wonder'd, and was fir'd.What foreign theatres with pride have shewn,Britain, by juster title, makes her own.When freedom is the cause, 'tis hers to fight;And hers, wken freedom is the theme, to write.For this, a British Author bids againThe heroine rise, to grace the British scene.Here, as in life, she breathes her genuine flame:She asks what bosom has not felt the same?Asks of the British Youth—Is silence there?She dares to ask it of the British Fair.To night, our home-spun author would be true,At once, to nature, history, and you.Well-pleas'd to give our neighbours due applause,He owns their learning, but disdains their laws.Not to his patient touch, or happy flame,'Tis to his British heart he trusts for fame.If France excel him in one free-born thought,The man, as well as poet, is in fault.Nature! informer of the poet's art,Whose force alone can raise or melt the heart,Thou art his guide; each passion, every line,Whate'er he draws to please, must all be thine.Be thou his judge: in every candid breast,Thy silent whisper is the sacred test.The Persons represented.MASINISSA, King of Massylia,By Mr. Wilks.SYPHAX, King of Masoesylia,By Mr. Mills.NARVA, Friend to Masinissa,By Mr. Roberts.SCIPIO, the Roman General,By Mr. Williams.LAELIUS, his Lieutenant,By Mr. Bridgewater.SOPHONISBA,By Mrs. Oldfield.PHOENISSA, her Friend,By Mrs. Roberts.Messenger, Slave, Guards, and Attendants. SCENE The Palace of CIRTHA.SOPHONISBA. A TRAGEDY.ACT I. SCENE I.SOPHONISBA, PHOENISSA.SOPHONISBA.THIS hour, Phoenissa, this important hour,Or fixes me a queen, or from a throneThrows Sophonisba into Roman chains.Detested thought! For now his utmost forceCollected, desperate, distress'd, and soreFrom battles lost; with all the rage of war,Ill-fated Syphax makes his last effort.But say, thou partner of my hopes and fears,Phoenissa, say; while, from the lofty tower,Our straining eyes the field of battle sought,
Ah, thought you not that our Numidian troopsGave up the broken field, and scattering fled,Wild o'er the hills, from the rapacious sonsOf still triumphant Rome?PHOENISSA.The dream of care!And think not, madam, Syphax can resign,But with his ebbing life, in this last field,A crown, a kingdom, and a queen he lovesBeyond ambition's brightest wish; for whom,Nor mov'd by threats, nor bound by plighted faith,He scorn'd the Roman friendship (that fair nameFor slavery) and from th' engagements brokeOf Scipio, fam'd for every winning art,The towering genius of recover'd Rome.SOPHONISBA.Oh name him not! These Romans stir my bloodTo too much rage. I cannot bear the fortuneOf that proud people.—Said you not, Phoenissa,That Syphax lov'd me; which would fire his battle,And urge him on to death or conquest? True,He loves me with the madness of desire;His every passion is a slave to love;Nor heeds he danger where I bid him go,Nor leagues, nor interest. Hence these endless wars,These ravag'd countries, these successless fights,Sustain'd for Carthage; whose defence aloneEngag'd my loveless marriage-vows with his.But know you not, that in the Roman campI have a lover too; a gallant, brave,And disappointed lover, full of wrath,Returning to a kingdom whence the swordOf Syphax drove him?PHOENISSA.Masinissa?SOPHONISBA.He:Young Masinissa, the Massylian king;The first addresser of my youth; for whomMy bosom felt a fond beginning wish,
Extinguish'd soon; when once to Scipio's sideWon o'er, and dazled by th' enchanting glareOf that fair seeming heroe, he becameA gay admiring slave, yet knew it not.E'er since, my heart has held him in contempt;And thrown out each idea of his worth,That there began to grow: nay had it beenAs all-possest, and soft, as her's who sitsIn secret shades, or by the falling stream,And wastes her being in unutter'd pangs,I would have broke, or cur'd it of its fondness.PHOENISSA.Heroic Sophonisba!SOPHONISBA.No, Phoenissa;It is not for the daughter of great Asdrubal,Descended from a long illustrious lineOf Carthaginian heroes, who have oftFill'd Italy with terror and dismay,And shook the walls of Rome, to pine in love,Like a deluded maid; to give her life,And heart high-beating in her country's cause,Meant not for common aims and houshold cares,To give them up to vain presuming man;Much less to one who stoops the neck to Rome,An enemy to Carthage, Masinissa.PHOENISSA.Think not I mean to check that glorious flame,That just ambition which exalts your soul,Fires on your cheek, and lightens in your eye.Yet would he had been yours! this rising prince;For, trust me, fame is fond of Masinissa.His various fortune, his resplendent deeds,His courage, conduct, deep-experienc'd youth,And vast unbroken spirit in distress,Still rising stronger from the last defeat,Are all the talk and terror too of Afric.Who has not heard the story of his woes?How hard he came to his paternal reign;Whence soon by Syphax' unrelenting hate,
And jealous Carthage driven, he with a fewFled to the mountains. Then, I think, it wasHem'd in a circle of impending rocks,That all his followers fell, save fifty horse;Who, thence escap'd thro' secret paths abrupt,Gain'd the Clupean plain. There overtook,And urg'd by fierce surrounding foes, he burstWith four alone, sore wounded, thro' their ranks,And all amidst a mighty torrent plung'd.Seiz'd by the whirling gulph, two sunk; and two,With him obliquely hurried down the stream,Wrought to the farther shore. Th'astonish'd troopsStood check'd, and shivering on the gloomy brink,And deem'd him lost in the devouring flood.Mean time the dauntless, undespairing youthLay in a cave conceal'd; curing his woundsWith mountain-herbs, and on his horses fed:Nor here, even at the lowest ebb of life,Stoop'd his aspiring mind. What need I say,How once again restor'd, and once againExpell'd, among the Garamantian hillsHe since has wander'd, till the Roman armReviv'd his cause? And who shall reign alone,Syphax or he, this day decides.SOPHONISBA.Enough.Thou need'st not blazon thus his fame, Phoenissa.Were he as glorious as the pride of womanCould wish, in all her wantonness of thought;The joy of humankind; wise, valiant, good;With every praise, with every laurel crown'd;The warriour's wonder, and the virgin's sigh:Yet this would cloud him o'er, this blemish all;His mean submission to the Roman yoke;That, false to Carthage, Afric, and himself,With proferr'd hand and knee, he hither ledThese ravagers of earth.—But while we talk,The work of fate goes on; even now perhapsMy dying country bleeds in every vein,And the warm victor thunders at our gate.SCENE II.SOPHONISBA, PHOENISSA, and to them a MESSENGER from the Battle.SOPHONISBA.Ha! Whence art thou? Speak, tho' thy bleeding woundsMight well excuse thy tongue.MESSENGER.Madam escap'd,With much ado, from yon wide death—SOPHONISBA.No more.At once thy meaning flashes o'er my soul.Oh all my vanish'd hopes! repairless chanceOf undiscerning war!—And is all lost?An universal havock?MESSENGER.Madam, all.For scarce a Masoesylian, save my self,But is or seiz'd, or bites the bloody plain.The King—SOPHONISBA.Ah! what of him?MESSENGER.His fiery steed,By Masinissa, the Massylian prince,Pierc'd, threw him headlong to his clustering foes;And now he comes in chains.SOPHONISBA.'Tis wond'rous fit,Absolute gods! All Afric is in chains!The weeping world in chains!—Oh is there not
A time, a righteous time, reserv'd in fate,When these oppressors of mankind shall feelThe miseries they give; and blindly fightFor their own fetters too?—The conquering troops,How points their motion?MESSENGER.At my heels they came,Loud-shouting, dreadful, in a cloud of dust,By Masinissa headed.SOPHONISBA.Hark! arriv'd.The murmuring crowd rolls frighted to the palace.Thou bleed'st to death, poor faithful wretch, away,And dress thy wounds, if life be worth thy care;Tho' Rome, methinks, will lose a slave in thee.Would Sophonisba were as near the vergeOf boundless, and immortal liberty!SCENE III.SOPHONISBA, PHOENISSA.[After a Pause.]SOPHONISBA.And wherefore not? When liberty is lost,Let slaves and cowards live; but in the braveIt were a treachery to themselves, enoughTo merit chains. And is it fit for me,Who in my veins, from Asdrubal deriv'd,Hold Carthaginian enmity to Rome;On whom I've lavish'd all my burning soul,In everlasting hate; for whose destructionI sold my joyless youth to Syphax' arms,And turn'd him fierce upon them; fit for such
A native, restless, unrelenting foe,To sit down softly-pensive, and awaitTh'approaching victor's rage; reserv'd in chainsTo grace his triumph, and become the scornOf every Roman dame—Gods! how my soulDisdains the thought! and this shall set it free.[Offers to stab her self.]PHOENISSA.Hold, Sophonisba, hold! my friend! my queen!For whom alone I live! hold your rash point,Nor thro' your guardian bosom stab your country.That is our last resort, and always sure.The gracious gods are liberal of death;To that last blessing lend a thousand ways.Think not I'd have you live to drag a chain,And walk the triumph of insulting Rome.No, by these tears of loyalty and love!Ere I beheld so vile a sight, this handShould urge the faithful poynard to your heart,And glory in the deed. But, while hope lives,Let not the generous die. 'Tis late beforeThe brave despair.SOPHONISBA.Thou copy of my soul!And now my friend indeed! Shew me but hope,One glimpse of hope, and I'll renew my toils,Call patience, labour, fortitude again,The vext unjoyous day, and sleepless night;Nor shrink at danger, any shape of death,Shew me the smallest hope! Alas, Phoenissa,Too kindly confident! Hope lives not here,Fled with her sister Liberty beyondThe Garamantian hills, to some steep wild,Some undiscover'd country, where the footOf Roman cannot come.PHOENISSA.Yes, there she liv'dWith Massinissa, wounded, and forlorn,Amidst the serpents, hiss, and tygers, yell.—SOPHONISBA.Why nam'st thou him?PHOENISSA.Madam, in this forgiveMy forward zeal; from him proceeds our hope.He lov'd you once; nor is your form impair'd,Warm'd, and unfolded into stronger charms:Ask his protection from the Roman power,You must prevail; for Sophonisba sureFrom Masinissa cannot ask in vain.SOPHONISBA.Now, by the prompting genius of my country!I thank thee for the thought. True, there is painEven in descending thus to beg protection,From that degenerate youth. But oh for thee,My sinking country! and again to gaulThis hated Rome, what would I not endure?It shall be done, Phoenissa; tho' disgustChoak'd up my struggling meaning, shall be done.[kneels.But here I vow, propitious Juno, hear!Could every pomp and every pleasure joyn'd,Love, empire, glory, a whole kneeling world,Unnerve my smallest purpose, and remitThat most inveterate enmity I bearThe Roman state; may Carthage smoak in ruins!Rome rise the mistress of mankind! and I,There an abandon'd slave, drag out a lengthOf life, in loathsome baseness, and contempt!This way the trumpet sounds; let us retire.SCENE IV.MASINISSA, SYPHAX in Chains, NARVA, Guards, &c.SYPHAX.Is there no dungeon in this city? dark,As is my troubled soul? That thus I'm broughtTo my own palace, to those rooms of state,Wont in another manner to receive me,With other signs of royalty than these.(looking on his chains.)MASINISSA.I will not wound thee, not insult thee, Syphax,With a recital of thy tyrant crimes.A captive here I see thee, fallen belowMy most revengeful wish; and all the rage,The noble fury that inspir'd this mornIs sunk to soft compassion. In the field,The flaming front of war, there is the sceneOf brave revenge; and I have sought thee there,Keen as the hunted lyon seeks his foe.But when a broken enemy, disarm'd,And helpless lies; a falling sword, an eyeWith pity flowing, and an arm as weakAs infant softness, then becomes the brave.Now sleeps the sword; the passions of the fieldSubside to peace; and my relenting soulMelts at thy fate.SYPHAX.This, this, is all I dread,All I detest, this insolence refin'd,This barbarous pity, this affected goodness.Pitied by thee!—Is there a form of death,
Of torture, and of infamy like that?It kills my very soul!—Ye partial gods!I feel your worst; why should I fear you more?Hear me, vain youth! take notice—I abhorThy mercy, loath it.—Poison to my thoughts!Wouldst thou be merciful? One way aloneThou canst oblige me.—Use me like a slave;As I would thee, (delicious thought!) wert thouHere crouching in my power.MASINISSA.Outragious man!If that is mercy, I'll be cruel still.Nor canst thou drive me, by thy bitterest rage,To an unmanly deed; not all thy wrongs,Nor this worse triumph in them.SYPHAX.Ha! ha! wrongs?I cannot wrong thee. When we lanch the spearInto the monster's heart, or crush the serpent;Destroy what in antipathy we hold,The common foe; can that be call'd a wrong?Injurious that? Absurd! it cannot be.MASINISSA.I'm loth to hurt thee more.—The tyrant worksToo fierce already in thy rankled breast.But since thou seem'st to rank me with thy self,With great destroyers, with perfidious kings;I must reply to thy licentious tongue,Bid thee remember, whose accursed swordBegan this work of death; who broke the ties,The holy ties, attested by the gods,Which bind the nations in the bond of peace;Who meanly took advantage of my youth,Unskill'd in arms, unsettled on my throne,And drove me to the desart, there to dwellWith kinder monsters; who my cities sack'd,My country pillag'd, and my subjects murder'd;Who still pursu'd me with inveterate hate,When generous force prov'd vain, with ruffian arts,The villain's dagger, base assassination.
And for no reason all. Brute violenceAlone thy plea.—What the least provocation,Say, canst thou but pretend?SYPHAX.I needed none.Nature has in my being sown the seedsOf enmity to thine.—Nay mark me this.Couldst thou restore me to my former state,Strike off these chains, give me the sword again,The sceptre, and the wide-obedient war:Yet must I still, implacable to thee,Seek eagerly thy death, or die my self.Life cannot hold us both!—Unequal gods!Who love to disappoint mankind, and takeAll Vengeance to your selves; why to the pointOf my long-flatter'd wishes did ye lift me,Then sink me thus so low? Just as I drewThe glorious stroke that was to make me happy,Why did you blast my strong extended arm?Strike the dry sword unsated to the ground?But that to mock us is your cruel sport?What else is human life?MASINISSA.Thus always join'dWith an inhuman heart, and brutal manners,Is irreligion to the ruling gods;Whose schemes our peevish ignorance arraigns,Our thoughtless pride.—Thy lost condition, Syphax,Is nothing to the tumult of thy breast.There lies the sting of evil, there the dropThat poisons nature.—Ye mysterious powers!Whose ways are ever-gracious, ever-just,As ye think wisest, best, dispose of me;But, whether thro' your gloomy depths I wander,Or on your mountains walk; give me the calmThe steady, smiling soul; where wisdom sheds,Eternal sunshine and eternal joy.Then, if misfortune comes, she brings alongThe bravest virtues. And so many greatIllustrious spirits have convers'd with woe,
(The pride of adverse fate!) as are enoughTo consecrate distress, and make even deathAmbition.SYPHAX.Torture! Racks! The common trickOf insolent success, unsuffering pride,This prate of patience, and I know not what.'Tis all a lie, impracticable rant;And only tends to make me scorn thee more.But why this talk? In mercy send me hence;Yet—ere I go—Oh save me from distraction!I know, hot youth, thou burnest for my queen;But by the majesty of ruin'd kings,And that commanding glory which surrounds her,I charge thee touch her not!MASINISSA.No, Syphax, no.Thou need'st not charge me. That were mean indeed,A triumph that to thee. But could I stoopAgain to love her; Thou, what right hast thou,A captive, to her bed? Nor life, nor queen,Nor ought, a captive has. All laws in this,Roman and Carthaginian, all agree.SYPHAX.Here, here, begins the bitterness of death!Here my chains grind me first!MASINISSA.Poor Sophonisba!She too becomes the prize of conquering Rome;What most her heart abhors. Alas, how hardWill slavery sit on her exalted soul!How piteous hard! But, if I know her well,She never will endure it, she will die.For not a Roman burns with nobler ardor,A higher sense of liberty than she;And tho' she marry'd thee, her only stain,False to my youth, and faithless to my vows;Yet, I must own it, from a worthy cause,From publick spirit did her fault proceed.SYPHAX.Blue plagues, and poison on thy meddling tongue!Talk not of her; for every word of herIs a keen dagger, griding thro' my heart.Oh, for a lonely dungeon! where I ratherWould talk with my own groans, and great revenge,Than in the mansions of the blest with thee.Hell! Whither must I go?MASINISSA.Unhappy man!And is thy breast determin'd against peace,On comfort shut?SYPHAX.On all, but death, from thee.MASINISSA.Narva, be Syphax thy peculiar care;And use him well with tenderness and honour.This evening Lelius, and to morrow Scipio,To Cirtha come. Then let the Romans takeTheir prisoner.SYPHAX.There shines a gleam of hopeAcross the gloom—From thee deliver'd!—EaseBreathes in that thought—Lead on—My heart grows lighter!SCENE V.MASINISSA alone.What dreadful havoc in the human breastThe passions make, when unconfin'd, and mad,They burst, unguided by the mental eye,The light of reason; which in various waysPoints them to good, or turns them back from ill.O save me from the tumult of the soul!From the wild beasts within!—For circling sands,When the swift whirlwind whelms them o'er the lands;The roaring deeps that to the clouds arise,While thwarting thick the mingled lightning flies;The monster-brood to which this land gives birth,The blazing city, and the gaping earth;All deaths, all tortures, in one pang combin'd,Are gentle to the tempest of the mind.The End of the First Act.ACT II. SCENE I.MASINISSA, NARVA,MASINISSA.—'Tis true, my friend,Thou good old man, by whom my youth was form'd,The firm companion of my various life,I own, 'tis true, that Sophonisba's imageLives in my bosom still; and at each glanceI take in secret of the bright idea,A strange disorder seizes on my soul,Which burns with stronger glory. Need I say,How once she had my vows? Till Scipio came,Resistless man! like a descending God,And snatch'd me from the Carthaginian sideTo nobler Rome; beneath whose laurel'd brow,And ample eye, the nations grow polite,Humane and happy. Then thou may'st remember,Such is this woman's high impetuous spirit,That all-controuling love she bears her country,Her Carthage; that at this she sacrific'dTo Syphax, unbelov'd, her blooming Years,And won him off from Rome.NARVA.My generous prince!Applauding Afric of thy choice approves.Fame claps her wings, and virtue smiles on thee,Of peace thou softner, and thou soul of war!But oh beware of that fair foe to glory,Woman! and most of Carthaginian woman!Who has not heard of fatal Punic guile?Of their sly conquests? their insidious leagues?
Their Asdrubals? their Hannibals? with allTheir wily heroes? And, if such their men,What must their women be?MASINISSA.You make me smile.I thank thy honest zeal. But never dreadThe firmness of my heart, my strong attachment,Severe to Rome, to Scipio, and to Glory.Indeed, I cannot, would not quite forgetThe grace of Sophonisba; how she look'd,And talk'd, and mov'd, a Pallas, or a Juno!Accomplish'd even in trifles, when she stoop'dAmbition's flight, and with a soften'd eyeGave her quick spirit into gayer life.Then every word was liveliness, and wit;We heard the Muses' song; and the dance swamThro' all the maze of harmony. I flatter not,Believe me, Narva; yet my panting soul,To Scipio taken in the fair pursuitOf fame, and for my people's happiness,Resign'd this Sophonisba; and tho' nowConstrain'd by soft necessity to see her,And she a captive in my power, will stillResign her.NARVA.Let me not doubt thy fortitude,My Masinissa, thy exalted purposeNot to be lost in love; but ah! we know not,Oft, till experience sighs it to the soul,The boundless witchcraft of ensnaring woman,And our own slippery hearts. From Scipio learnThe temperance of heroes. I'll recountTh' instructive story, what these eyes beheld;Perhaps you've heard it; but 'tis pleasing still,Tho' told a thousand times.MASINISSA.I burn to hear it.Lost by my late misfortunes in the desart,I liv'd a stranger to the voice of fame,To Scipio's last exploits. Exalt me now.
Great actions raise the mind. But when a friend,A Scipio does them; then with more than wonder,Even with a sort of vanity we listen.NARVA.When to his glorious, first essay in war,New Carthage fell; there all the flower of SpainWere kept in hostage; a full field presentingFor Scipio's generosity to shine.And then it was, that when the heroe heard▪How I to thee belong'd, he with large gifts,And friendly words dismiss'd me.MASINISSA.I remember.And in his favour that impress'd me first.But to thy story.NARVA.What with admirationStruck every heart, was this—A noble virgin,Conspicuous far o'er all the captive dames,Was mark'd the general's prize. She wept, and blush'd,Young, fresh, and blooming like the morn. An eye,As when the blue sky trembles thro' a cloudOf purest white. A secret charm combin'dHer features, and infus'd enchantment thro' them.Her shape was harmony.—But eloquenceBeneath her beauty fails; which seem'd, on purpose,Pour'd out by lavish nature, that mankindMight see this action in its highest lustre.Soft, as she pass'd along, with downcast eyes,Where gentle sorrow swell'd, and now and thenDropt o'er her modest cheek a trickling tear,The Roman legions languish'd; and hard warFelt more than pity. Even Scipio's self,As on his high tribunal rais'd he sat,Turn'd from the piercing sight, and chiding ask'dHis officers, if by this gift they meantTo cloud his glory in its very dawn.MASINISSA.Oh Gods! my fluttering heart! On, stop not, Narva.NARVA.She question'd of her birth, in trembling accents,With tears and blushes broken, told her tale.But when he found her royally descended,Of her old captive parents the sole joy;And that a hapless Celtiberian prince,Her lover and belov'd, forgot his chains,His lost dominions, and for her aloneWept out his tender soul; sudden the heartOf this young, conquering, loving, godlike RomanFelt all the great divinity of virtue▪His wishing youth stood check'd, his tempting power▪By infinite humanity—MASINISSA.Well, well;And then!NARVA.Disdaining guilty doubt, at onceHe for her parents and her lover call'd.The various scene imagine: How his troopsLook'd dubious on, and wonder'd what he meant;While stretch'd below the trembling suppliants lay,Rack'd by a thousand mingling passions, fear,Hope, jealousy, disdain, submission, grief,Anxiety, and love in every shape.To these as different sentiments succeeded,As mixt emotions, when the man divineThus the dread silence to the lover broke." We both are young, both charm'd. The Right of War" Has put thy beauteous mistress in my power;" With whom I could, in the most sacred ties," Live out a happy life: But know that Romans" Their hearts as well as enemies can conquer." Then take her to thy soul; and with her take" Thy liberty and kingdom. In return" I ask no more, but, when you view these eyes," These charms, with transport, be a friend to Rome.MASINISSA.There spoke the soul of Scipio—But the Lovers?NARVA.Joy and extatic wonder held them mute;While the lowd camp, and all the clustring crowd,That hung around, rang with repeated shouts.Fame took th' alarm, and thro' resounding SpainBlew fast the fair report; which, more than arms,Admiring nations to the Romans gain'd,MASINISSA.My friend in glory! thy awaken'd princeSprings at thy faithful tale. It fires my soul,And nerves each thought anew; apt oft perhaps,Too much, too much to slacken into love.But now the soft oppression flies; and allMy mounting powers expand to deeds like thine,Thou pattern and inspirer of my fame,Scipio, thou first of men, and best of friends!What man of soul would live, my Narva, breatheThis idle-puffing element; and run,Day after day, the still-returning roundOf life's mean offices, and sickly joys;But in compassion to mankind? to beA guardian God below? to dissipateAn ardent being in heroic aims?Do something vastly great like what you told?Something to raise him o'er the groveling herd,And make him shine for ever?—Oh, my friend!Bleed every vein about me; every nerveWith anguish tremble; every sinew ake;Be toil familiar to my limbs; ambitionMix all my thoughts in an incessant whirl;The third time may I lose my kingdom; and againWander the false inhospitable Syrts;Yet oh, ye liberal Gods! in rich award,And amplest recompence—I ask no more—Share me the wreath of fame from Scipio's brow!But see, she comes! mark her majestic port.SCENE II.MASINISSA, SOPHONISBA, NARVA, PHOENISSA.SOPHONISBA.Behold, victorious prince! the scene revers'd;And Sophonisba kneeling here; a captive,O'er whom the Gods, thy Fortune, and thy Virtue,Have given unquestion'd power of life and death.If such a one may raise her suppliant voice,Once music to thy ear; if she may touchThy knee, thy purple, and thy victor-hand;Oh listen, Masinissa! Let thy soulIntensely listen! While I fervent pray,And strong adjure thee, by that regal state,In which with equal pomp we lately shone!By the Numidian name, our common boast!And by those houshold gods! who may, I wish,With better omens take thee to this palace,Than Syphax hence they sent. As is thy pleasure,In all beside determine of my fate.This, this alone I beg. Never, oh never!Into the cruel, proud, and hated powerOf Romans let me fall. Since angry heavenWill have it so, that I must be a slave,And that a galling chain must bind these hands;It were some little softning in my doom,To call a kindred son of the same clime,A native of Numidia, my lord.But if thou canst not save me from the Romans,If this sad favour be beyond thy power;At least to give me death is what thou canst.Here strike—my naked bosom courts thy sword;And my last breath shall bless thee, Masinissa.MASINISSA.Rise, Sophonisha, rise. To see thee thusIs a revenge I scorn; and all the manWithin me, though much injur'd by thy pride,And spirit too tempestuous for thy sex,Yet blushes to behold thus at my feet,Thus prostrate low, her, for whom kings have kneel'd,The fairest, but the falsest of her sex.SOPHONISBA.Spare thy reproach.—'Tis cruel thus to loseIn ranckling discord, and ungenerous strife,The few remaining moments that divide meFrom the last evil, bondage—Roman bondage!Yes, shut thy heart against me. Shut thy heartAgainst compassion, every human thought,Even recollected love: Yet know, rash Youth!That when thou seest me swell their lofty triumph,Thou seest thy self in me. This is my day;To morrow may be thine. But here, assur'd,Here will I lie on this vile earth, forlorn,Of hope abandon'd, since despis'd by thee;These locks all loose and sordid in the dust;This sullied bosom growing to the ground,Scorch'd up with anguish, and of every shapeOf misery full: till comes the soldier fierceFrom recent blood; and, in thy very eye,Lays raging his rude sanguinary graspOn these weak limbs; and clinches them in chains.Then if no friendly steel, no nectar'd draughtOf deadly poison, can enlarge my soul;It will indignant burst from a slave's body;And, join'd to mighty Dido, scorn ye all.MASINISSA.Oh Sophonisba! 'tis not safe to hear thee;And I mistook my Heart, to trust it thus.Hence let me fly.SOPHONISBA.You shall not, Masinissa!Here will I hold you, tremble here for ever;Here unremitting grow, till you consent.
And can'st thou think, oh! canst thou think to leave me?Expos'd, defenceless, wretched, here alone?A prey to Romans flush'd with blood and conquest?The subject of their scorn or baser love?Sure Masinissa cannot; and, tho' chang'd,Tho' cold as that averted look he wears;Sure love can ne'er in generous breasts be lostTo that degree, as not from shame and outrageTo save what once they lov'd.MASINISSA.Enchantment! Madness!What would'st thou, Sophonisba!—Oh my heart!My treacherous heart!SOPHONISBA.What would I, Masinissa?My mean Request sits blushing on my cheek.To be thy slave, young prince, is what I beg;Here Sophonisba kneels to be thy slave;Yet kneels in vain. But thou'rt a slave thy self,And canst not from the Romans save one woman;Her, who was once the triumph of thy soul;E'er they seduc'd it by their lying glory.Immortal gods! and am I fallen so low?Scorn'd by a lover? by a slave to Rome?Nought can be worth this baseness, life, nor empire!I loath me for it.—On this kinder earth,Then leave me, leave me, to despair and death!MASINISSA.What means this conflict with almighty nature?With the whole warring heart?—Rise, quickly rise,In all the conquering majesty of charms,O Sophonisba, rise! while here I swear,By the tremendous powers that rule mankind!By heaven and earth, and hell! by love, and glory!The Romans shall not hurt you—Romans cannot;For Rome is generous as the gods themselves,And honours, not insults, a generous foe.Yet since you dread them, take this sacred pledge,This hand of surety, by which kings are bound;
By which I hold you mine, and vow to treat you,With all the rev'rence due to ruin'd state,With all the softness of remember'd love,All that can sooth thy fate, and make thee happy.SOPHONISBA.I thank thee, Masinissa! now the same;The same warm youth, exalted, full of soul;With whom in happier days I wont to passThe sighing hour: while, dawning fair in love,All song and sweetness, life set joyous out;Ere the black tempest of ambition rose,And drove us different ways.—Thus dress'd in war,In nodding plumes, o'ercast with sullen thought,With purpos'd vengeance dark, I knew thee not;But now breaks out the beauteous fun anew,The gay Numidian shines who warm'd me once,Whose love was glory.—Vain ideas, hence!—Long since my heart, to nobler passions known,Has your acquaintance scorn'd.MASINISSA.Oh! while you talk,Enchanting fair one! my deluded thoughtRuns back to days of love; when fancy stillFound worlds of beauty, ever rising newTo the transported eye; when flattering hopeForm'd endless prospects of increasing bliss;And still the credulous heart believ'd them all,Even more than love could promise.—But the sceneIs full of danger for a tainted eye;I must not, dare not, will not look that way.O hide it, wisdom, glory, from my view!Or in sweet ruin I shall link again.Disaster clouds thy cheek; thy colour goes.Retire, and from the troubles of the dayRepose thy weary soul; worn out with care,And rough unhappy thought.SOPHONISBA.May MasinissaNe'er want the goodness he has shewn to me.SCENE III.MASINISSA, NARVA.MASINISSA.The danger's o'er, I've heard the Syren's song,Yet still to glory hold my steady course.I mark'd thy kind concern, thy friendly fears,And own them just; for she has beauty, Narva,So full, so perfect, with so great a soulInform'd, so pointed high with spirit,As strikes like lightning from the hand of Jove,And raises love to glory.NARVA.Ah, my Prince!Too true, it is too true; her fatal charmsAre powerful, and to Masinissa's heartBut know the way too well. And art thou sure,That the soft poison, which within thy veinsLay unextinguish'd, is not rouz'd a new?Is not this moment working thro' thy soul?Doft thou not love? Confess.MASINISSA.What said my friend,Of poison? love? of loving Sopkon sba?Yes, I admire her, wonder at her beauty;And he who does not is as dull as earth,The cold unanimated form of man,E'er lighted up with the celestial fire.Wheree'r she goes still admiration gazes,And listens while she talks. Even thou thy self,Who saw'st her with the malice of a friend,Even thou thy self admir'st her.—Dost thou not?Say, speak sincerely.NARVA.She has Charms indeed;But has she charms like virtue? Tho' majestic;Does she command us, is her force like glory?MASINISSA.All glory's in her eye! Perfection thenceLooks from his throne; and on her ample browSits majesty. Her features glow with life,Warm with heroic soul. Her mien!—she walks,As when a towering goddess treads this earth.But when her language flows; when such a oneDescends to sooth, to sigh, to weep, to graspThe tottering knee; oh! Narva, Narva, oh.!Expression here is dumb.NARVA.Alas! my Lord,Is this the talk of sober admiration?Are these the sallies of a heart at ease?Of Scipio's friend? And was it the calm senseOf fair perfection, that, the while she kneel'dFor what you rashly promis'd, seiz'd your soul;Stole out in secret transports from your eye;That writh'd you groaning round, and shook your Frame.MASINISSA.I tell thee once again, too cautious man,That when a woman begs, a matchless woman,A woman once belov'd, a fallen queen,A Sophonisba! when she twines her charmsAround our soul, and all her power of looks,Of tears, of sighs, of softness, plays upon us;He's more or less than man who can resist her.For me, my stedfast soul approves, nay more,Exults in the protection it has promis'd.And nought, tho' plighted honour did not bind me,Shall shake the happy purpose of my heart;Nought, by th'avenging gods! who heard my vow,And hear me now again.NARVA.And was it thenFor this you conquer'd?MASINISSA.Yes, and triumph in it.This was my fondest wish; the very point,The plume of glory, the delicious prizeOf bleeding years. And I had been a brute,A greater monster than Numidia breeds,A horror to my self; if on the ground,Cast vilely from me, I th'illustrious fair oneHad left to bondage, bitterness, and death.Nor is there ought in war worth what I feel;In pomp and hollow state, like this sweet senseOf infelt bliss; which the reflection gives me,Of saving thus such excellence and beautyFrom her supreme abhorrence.NARVA.Masinissa,My friend! my royal lord! alas! you slide,You sink from virtue. On the giddy brinkOf fate you stand.—One step, and all is loft!MASINISSA.No more, no more! if this is being lost.If this, mistaken! is forsaking virtue,And rushing down the precipice of fate;Then down I go, far far beyond the dinOf scrupulous dull precaution.—Leave me, Narva.I want to be alone, to find some Shade,Some solitary gloom; there to shake offThis weight of life, this tumult of mankind,This sick ambition on it self recoiling;And there to listen to the gentle voice,The sigh of peace, something, I know not what,That whispers transport to my heart.—Farewel.SCENE IV.NARVA alone.Struck, and he knows it not.—So when the field,Elate in heart, the warriour scorns to yield;The streaming blood can scarce convince his eyes;Nor will he feel the wound by which he dies.The End of the Second Act.ACT III. SCENE I.MASINISSA alone.IN vain I wander thro' the shade for peace;'Tis with the calm alone, the pure of heart,That there the goddess talks—But in my breastSome busy thought, some secret-eating pang,Throbs inexpressible; and rowls from—What?From charm to charm, on Sophonisba stillEarnest, intent, devoted all to her.Oh it must out!—'Tis love, almighty love!Returning on me with a stronger tide.I'll doubt no more, but give it up to love.Come to my breast, thou rosy-smiling god!Come unconfin'd! bring all thy joys along,All thy soft cares, and mix them copious here.But why invoke I thee? Thy power is weak,To Sophonisba's eye, thy quiver poor,To the resistless lightning of her form;And dull thy bare insinuating arts,To the sweet mazes of her flowing tongue.Quick, let me fly to her; and there forgetThis tedious absence, war, ambition, noise,Even friendship's self, the vanity of fame,And all but love, for love is more than all!SCENE II.MASINISSA, NARVA.MASINSSSA.Welcome again, my friend,—Come nearer, Narva;Lend me thine arm, and I will tell thee all,Unfold my secret heart, whose every pulseWith Sophonisba beats.—Nay hear me out—Swift, as I mus'd, the conflagration spread;At once too strong, too general, to be quench'd.I love, and I approve it, doat upon her,Even think these minutes lost I talk with thee.Heavens! what emotions have possess'd my soul!Snatch'd by a moment into years of passion.NARVA.Ah Masinissa!—MASINISSA.Argue not against me.Talk down the circling winds that lift the desart;And, touch'd by Heaven, when all the forests blaze,Talk down the flame, but not my stronger love.I have for love a thousand thousand reasons,Dear to the heart, and potent o'er the soul.My ready thoughts all rising, restless all,Are a perpetual spring of tenderness;Oh! Sophonisba! Sophonisba! oh!NARVA.Is this deceitful day then come to nought?This day, that set thee on a double throne?That gave thee Syphax chain'd, thy deadly foe?With perfect conquest crown'd thee, perfect glory?Is it so soon eclips'd? and does yon sun,Yon setting sun, who this fair morning saw thee
Ride through the ranks of long extended war,As radiant as himself; with every glanceWheeling the pointed files; and, when the stormBegan, beheld thee tread the rising surgeOf battle high, and drive it on the foe;Does he now, blushing, see thee sunk so weak?Caught in a smile? the captive of a look?I cannot name it without tears.MASINISSA.Away!I'm sick of war, of the destroying trade,Smooth'd o'er, and gilded with the name of glory.Thou need'st not spread the martial field to me;My happier eyes are turn'd another way,Behold it not; or, if they do, behold itShrunk up, far off, a visionary scene;As to the waking man appears the dream.NARVA.Or rather as realities appear,The virtue, pomp, and dignities of life,In sick disorder'd dreams,MASINISSA.Think not I scornThe task of heroes, when oppression rages,And lawless violence confounds the world.Who would not bleed with transport for his country,Tear every dear relation from his heart,And greatly die to make a people happy;Ought not to taste of happiness himself,And is low-soul'd indeed—But sure, my friend,There is a time for love, or life were vile!A sickly circle of revolving days,Led on by hope, with senseless hurry fill'd,And clos'd by disappointment. Round and round,Still hope for ever wheels the daily cheat;Impudent hope! unjoyous madness all!Till lóve comes stealing in, with his kind hours,His healing lips, his cordial sweets, his cares.Infusing joy, his joys ineffable!That make the poor account of life compleat,
And justify the Gods.NARVA.Mistaken Prince,I blame not love. But—MASINISSA.Slander not my passion.I've suffer'd thee too far.—Take heed, old man.—Love will not bear an accusation, Narva.NARVA.I'll speak the truth, when truth and friendship call,Nor fear thy frown unkind.—Thou hast no rightTo Sophonisba; she belongs to Rome.MASINISSA.Ha! she belongs to Rome.—'Tis true—My thoughtsWhere have you wander'd, not to think of this?Think e'er I promis'd? e'er I lov'd?—Confusion!I know not what I say—I should have lov'd,Tho' Jove in muttering thunder had forbid it.But Rome will not refuse so small a boon,Whose gifts are kingdoms; Rome must grant it sure,One captive to my wish, one poor request,So small to them, but oh so dear to me!Here let my heart confide.NARVA.Delusive love!Thro' what wild projects is the frantick mindBeguil'd by thee?—And think'st thou that the Romans,The senators of Rome, these gods on earth,Wise, steady to the right, severely just,All incorrupt, and like eternal fateNot to be mov'd, will listen to the sighOf idle love? They, when their country calls,Who know no pain, no tenderness, no joy,But bid their children bleed before their eyes;That they'll regard the light fantastick pangsOf a fond heart? and with thy kingdom give theeTheir most inveterate foe; from their firm side,Like Syphax, to delude thee? and the pointOf their own bounty on themselves to turn?
Thou canst not hope it sure.—Impossible!MASINISSA.What shall I do?—Be now the friend exerted.For love and honour press me; love and honour,All that is dear and excellent in life,All that or sooths the man or lifts the heroe,Bind my soul deep.NARVA.Rash was your vow, my lord.I know not what to counsel.—When you vow'd,You vow'd what was not in your power to grant;And therefore 'tis not binding.MASINISSA.Never! Never!Oh never will I falsify that vow!E'er then destruction seize me! Yes, ye Romans,If it be so, there, take your kingdoms back,Your royal gewgaws, all for Sophonisba!Hold,—Let me think a while—It shall be so!By all th'inspiring gods that prompt my thought!This very night shall solemnize our vows;And the next joyous sun, that visits Afric,See Sophonisba seated on my throne.—Then if they spare her not,—not spare my queen,—Perdition on their stubborn pride call'd virtue!Be theirs the world, but Sophonisha mine!NARVA.And is it possible, ye Gods, that rule us!Can Masinissa in his pride of youth,In his meridian glory shining wide,The light of Afric, and the friend of Scipio;He take a woman to the nuptial bed,Who scorn'd him for a tyrant, old, and peevish,His rancorous foe? and gave her untouch'd bloom,Her spring of charms to Syphax?MASINISSA.Horrid friendship!This, this, has thrown a serpent to my heart;While it o'erflow'd with tenderness, with joy,
With all the sweetness of exulting love.Now nought but gall is there, and burning poison!Yes, it was so!—Curse on her vain ambition!What had her medling sex to do with states?The Business of men! For him! for Syphax!Forsook for him! my love for his gross passion!The thought is hell!—Oh I had treasur'd upA world of indignation, years of scorn;But her sad suppliant witchcraft sooth'd it down.Where is she now? That it may burst upon her;Bear her unbounded from me, down the torrent,Far, far away! And tho' my plighted faith,Shall save her from the Romans, yet to tell her,That I will never, never see her more!Ha! there she comes.—Pernicious fair one!—Leave me.SCENE III.SOPHONISBA, MASINISSA.SOPHONISBA.Forgive this quick return.—The rage, confusion,And mingled passions of this luckless day,Made me forget another warm requestI had to beg of generous Masinissa;For oh to whom, save to the generous, canThe miserable fly?—But much disturb'dYou look, and scowl upon me a denial.Repentance frowns on your contracted brow.Already, weary of my sinking fate,You seem to droop; and for unhappy SyphaxI shall implore in vain.MASINISSA.For Syphax? vengeance!And canst thou mention him? Oh grant me breath!SOPHONISBA.I know, young prince, how deep he has prov ok'd thee;How keen he sought thy youth; thro' what a fireOf great distress, from which you come the brighter.On dull indifferent objects, or perhapsDislik'd a little, 'tis but common bountyTo shower relief; but when our bitterest foeLies sunk, disarm'd, and desolate, then! then!To feel the mercies of a pitying God,To raise him from the dust, and that best wayTo triumph o'er him, is heroic goodness.Oh let unhappy Syphax touch thy heart,Victorious Masinissa!MASINISSA.Monstrous this!Still dost thou blast me with that cursed name!The very name thy conscious guilt should shun.Oh had he heap'd all ills upon my head,While it was young, and for the storm unfit;Had he but driven me from my native throne,From regal pomp and luxury, to dwellAmong the forest beasts; to bear the beamOf red Numidian suns, and the rank dewOf cold unshelter'd nights; to mix with wolves,To hunt with hungry tygers for my prey,And thirst with Dipsas on the burning sand;I could have thank'd him for his angry lesson;The fair occasion that his rage affordedOf learning patience, fortitude, and hope,Still rising stronger on incumbent fate,And all that try'd humanity can dictate.But there is one curs'd bitterness behind,One injury, the man can never pardon;That scorches up the tear in pity's eye,And even sweet mercy's self converts to gall.I cannot—will not name it—Heart of anguish!Down! down!SOPHONISBA.Ah! whence this sudden storm? this madness,That hurries all thy soul?MASINISSA.And dost thou ask?Ask thy own faithless heart; snatch'd from my Vows,From the warm wishes of my springing youth,And given to that old hated monster, Syphax.Perfidious Sophonisba!SOPHONISBA.Nay no more.With too much truth I can return thy charge.Why didst thou drive me to that cruel choice?Why leave me, with my country, to destruction?Why break thy love? thy faith? and join the Romans?MASINISSA.By heavens! the Romans were my better genius,Sav'd me from fate, and form'd my youth to glory;But for the Romans I had been a savage,A wretch like Syphax, a forgotten thing,The tool of Carthage.SOPHONISBA.Meddle not with Carthage,Impatient youth, for that I will not bear;Tho' here I were a thousand fold thy slave.Not one base word of Carthage—on thy soul!MASINISSA.How vain thy phrenzy! Go, command thy slaves,Thy fools, thy Syphaxes; but I will speak,Speak loud of Carthage, call it false, ungenerous,—Yet shall I check me, since it is thy country?While the Romans are the light, the glory—SOPHONISBA.Romans!Perdition on the Romans!—and almostOn the too—Romans are the scourgeOf the red world, destroyers of mankind,The ruffians, ravagers of earth; and all
Beneath the smooth dissimulating maskOf justice, and compassion; as if slaveWas but another name for civiliz'd.All vengeance on the Romans!—While fair CarthageUnblemish'd rises on the base of commerce;And asks of heaven nought but the general winds,And common tides, to carry plenty, joy,Civility, and grandeur, round the world.MASINISSA.No more compare them! for the gods themselvesDeclare for Rome.SOPHONISBA.It was not always so.The gods declar'd for Hannibal; when ItalyBlaz'd all around him, all her streams ran blood,All her incarnate vales were vile with death;And when at Trebia, Thrasymene, and Cannae,The Carthaginian sword with Roman bloodWas drunk—Oh that he then, on that dread day,While lifeless consternation blacken'd Rome,Had raz'd th' accursed city to the ground,And sav'd the world!—When will it come again,A day so glorious, and so big with vengeance,On those my soul abhors?MASINISSA.Avert  heaven!The Romans not enslave, but save the worldFrom Carthaginian rage.—SOPHONISBA.I'll bear no more!Nor tenderness, nor life, nor liberty,Nothing shall make me bear it.—Perish Rome!And all her menial friends!—Yes, rather, rather,Detested as ye are, ye Romans, take me,Oh pitying take me to your nobler chains!And save me from this abject youth, your slave!—How canst thou kill me thus?—MASINISSA.I meant it not.I only meant to tell thee, haughty fair one!
How this alone might bind me to the Romans;That, in a frail and sliding hour, they snatch'd meFrom the perdition of thy love; which fell,Like baleful lightning, where I most could wish,And prov'd destruction to my mortal foe.Oh pleasing! fortunate!SOPHONISBA.I thank them too.By heavens! for once, I love them; since they turn'dMy better thoughts from thee, thou—But I will notGive thee the name, thy mean servilityFrom my just scorn deserves.MASINISSA.Oh freely call me,By every name thy fury can inspire;Enrich me with contempt—I love no more—It will not hurt me, Sophonisba.—Love,Long since I gave it to the passing winds,And would not be a lover for the world.A lover is the very fool of nature;Made sick by his own wantonness of thought,His feaver'd fancy: while, to your own charmsImputing all, you swell with boundless pride.Shame on the wretch! who should be driven from men,To live with Asian slaves, in one soft herd,All wretched, all ridiculous together.For me, this moment, here I mean to bidFarewel, a glad farewel to love and thee.SOPHONISBA.With all my soul, farewel!—Yet, ere you go;Know that my spirit burns as high as thine,As high to glory, and as low to love.Thy promises are void; and I absolve thee,Here in the presence of the listning gods.—Take thy repented vows—To proud CorneliaI'd rather be a slave, to Scipio's mother;Than queen of all Numidia, by the favourOf him, who dares insult the helpless thus.(Pausing.)Still dost thou stay? behold me then again,Hopeless, and wild, a lost abandon'd slave.And now thy brutal purpose must be gain'd.Away, thou cruel, and ungenerous, go!MASINISSA.No, not for worlds would I resume my vow!Dishonour blast me then! all kind of illsFill up my cup of bitterness, and shame!When I resign thee to triumphant Rome.Oh lean not thus dejected on the ground!The sight is misery.—what roots me here?(Aside)Alas! I have urg'd my foolish heart too far;And love depress'd, recoils with greater force.Oh Sophonisha!SOPHONISBA.By thy pride she dies.Inhuman prince!MASINISSA.Thine is the conquest, nature!By heaven and earth! I cannot hold it more.Wretch that I was! to crush th' unhappy thus;The fairest too, the dearest of her sex!For whom my soul could dye!—Turn, quickly turn,O Sophonisha! my belov'd! my glory!Turn and forgive the violence of love,Of love that knows no bounds!SOPHONISBA.And can it be?Can that soft passion prove so fierce of heart,As on the tears of misery, the sighsOf death, to ? to torture what it loves?MASINISSA.Yes it can be, thou goddess of my soul!Whose each emotion is but varied love,All over love, its powers, its passions, all:Its anger, indignation, fury, love;Its pride, disdain, even detestation, love;And when it, wild, resolves to love no more,Then is the triumph of excessive love.Didst thou not mark me? mark the dubious rage,That tore my heart with anguish while I talk'd?Thou didst; and must forgive so kind a fault.What would thy trembling lips?SOPHONISBA.That I must die.For such another storm, so much contemptThrown out on Carthage, so much Praise on Rome,Were worse than death. Why should I longer tireMy weary fate? The most relentless RomanWhat could he more?MASINISSA.Oh Sophonisba, hear!See me thy suppliant now. Talk not of death.I have no life but thee.—Alas! Alas!Hadst thou a little tenderness for me,The smallest part of what I feel, thou wouldst—What wouldst thou not forgive? But how indeedHow can I hope it? Yet I from this moment,Will so devote my being to thy pleasure,So live alone to gain thee; that thou must,If there is human nature in thy breast,Feel some relenting warmth.SOPHONISBA.Well, well, 'tis past.To be inexorable suits not slaves.MASINISSA.Spare, spare that word; it stabs me to the soul;My crown, my life, and liberty are thine.Oh give my passion way! My heart is full,Oppress'd by love; and I could number tears,With all the dews that sprinkle o'er the morn;While thus with thee conversing, thus with theeEven happy to distress.—Enough, enough,Have we been cheated by the trick of state,For Rome and Carthage suffer'd much too long;And led, by gaudy fantoms, wander'd far,Far from our bliss. But now since met again,Since here I hold thee, circle all perfection,The prize of life! since fate too presses hard,
Since Rome and slavery drive thee to the brink;Let this immediate night exchange our vows,Secure my bliss, our future fortunes blend,Set thee, the queen of beauty, on my throne,And make it doubly mine.—A wretched giftTo what my love could give!SOPHONISBA.What? marry thee,This night?MASINISSA.Thou dear one! yes, this very night,Let injur'd Hymen have his rights restor'd,And bind our broken vows.—Think, serious, think!On what I plead.—A thousand reasons urge.—Captivity dissolves thy former marriage;And if 'tis with the meanest vulgar so,Can Sophonisba to a slave, to Syphax,The most exalted of her sex, be bound?Besides it is the best, perhaps sole way,To save thee from the Romans; and must sureBar their pretensions: or if ruin comes,To perish with thee is to perish happy.SOPHONISBA.Yet must I still insist.—MASINISSA.It shall be so.I know thy purpose; it would plead for Syphax.He shall have all, thou dearest! shall have all,Crowns, trifles, kingdoms, all again, but thee,But thee, thou more than all!SOPHONISBA.(Aside)Bear witness heaven!This is alone for Carthage.(To him)Gain'd by goodness,I may be thine. Expect no love, no sighing.Perhaps, hereafter, I may learn againTo hold thee dear. If on these terms thou canst,
Here take me, take me, to thy wishes.MASINISSA.Yes,Yes, Sophonisba! as a wretch takes lifeFrom off the bleeding rack.—All wild with joy,Thus hold thee, press thee, to my bounding heart;And bless the bounteous Gods.—Can heaven give more?Oh happy! happy! happy!—Come, my fair,This ready minute sees thy will perform'd;From Syphax knocks his chains; and I my self,Even in his favour, will request the Romans.Oh, thou hast smil'd my passions into peace!So, while conflicting winds embroil'd the Seas,In perfect bloom, warm with immortal blood,Young Venus rear'd her o'er the raging flood;She smil'd around, like thine her beauties glow'd;When smooth, in gentle swells, the surges flow'd;Sunk, by degrees, into a liquid plain;And one bright calm sat trembling on the main.The End of the Third Act.ACT IV. SCENE I.SOPHONISBA, PHOENISSA.PHOENISSA.HAIL queen of Masaesylia once again!And fair Massylia join'd! This rising daySaw Sophonisba, from the height of life,Thrown to the very brink of slavery:State, honours, armies vanquish'd; nothing leftBut her own great unconquerable mind.And yet, ere evening comes, to larger powerRestor'd, I see my royal friend; and kneelIn grateful homage to the Gods, and her.Ye Powers, what awful changes often markThe fortunes of the great!SOPHONISBA.Phoenissa, true;'Tis awful all, the wonderous work of fate.But ah! this sudden marriage damps my soul;I like it not, that wild precipitanceOf youth, that ardor, that impetuous streamIn which his love return'd. At first, my friend,He vainly rag'd with disappointed love;And, as the hasty storm subsided, thenTo softness varied, to returning fondness,To sighs, to tears, to supplicating vows;But all his vows were idle, till at lastHe shook my heart by Rome.—To be his queen,Could only save me from their horrid power.And there is madness in that thought, enoughIn that strong thought alone to make me runFrom nature.PHOENISSA.Was it not auspicious, madam?Just as we hop'd? just as our wishes plan'd?Nor let your spirit sink. Your serious hours,When you behold the Roman ravage check'd,From their enchantment Masinissa freed,And Carthage mistress of the world again,This marriage will approve: then will it riseIn all its glory, virtuous, wise and great,While happy nations, then deliver'd, joinTheir loud acclaim. And, had the white occasionNeglected flown, where now had been your hopes?Your liberty? your country? where your all?Think well of this, think that, think every way,And Sophonisba cannot but exultIn what is done.SOPHONISBA.So may my hopes succeed!As love alone to Carthage, to the public,Led me a marriage-victim to the temple,And justifies my vows.—Ha! Syphax here!What would his rage with me?—Phoenissa, stay.But this one tryal more—Heroic truth,Support me now!SCENE II.SYPHAX, SOPHONISBA, PHOENISSA.SYPHAX.You seem to fly me, madam,To shun my gratulations.—Here I come,To join the general joy; and I, sure I,Who have to dotage, have to ruin lov'd you,Must take a tender part in your success,In your recover'd state.SOPHONISBA.'Tis very well.I thank you, sir.SYPHAX.And gentle Masinissa,Say, will he prove a very coming fool?All pliant, all devoted to your will?A glorious wretch like Syphax?—Ha! not mov'd!Speak, thou perfidious! canst thou bear it thus?With such a steady countenance? canst thouHere see the man thou hast so grosly wrong'd,And yet not sink in shame? And yet not shakeIn every guilty nerve?SOPHONISBA.What have I done,That I should tremble? that I should not dareTo bear thy presence? Was my heart to blame,I'd tremble for my self, and not for thee,Proud man! Nor would I live to be asham'd.My soul it self would die, could the least shameOn her unspotted fame be justly cast:For of all evils, to the generous, shameIs the last deadly-pang.—But you beholdMy late engagement with a jealous, false,And selfish eye.SYPHAX.Avenging Juno, hear!And canst thou think to justify thy self?I blush to hear thee, traitress!SOPHONISBA.O my soul!Canst thou hear this, this base opprobrious language,And yet be tamely calm?—Well, well, for onceIt shall be so—in pity to thy madness—Impatient spirit down!—Yes, Syphax, yes,Yes I will greatly justify my self;Even by the consort of the thundering Jove,Who binds the holy marriage-vow, be judg'd.And every public heart, not meanly lostIn little low pursuits, to wretched self
Not all devoted, will absolve me too.But in the tempest of the soul, when rage,Loud indignation, unattending pride,And jealousy confound it, how can thenThe nobler passions, how can they be heard?Yet let me tell thee—SYPHAX.Thou canst tell me nought.Away! away! nought but illusion, falshood—SOPHONISBA.My heart will burst, in honour to my self,If here I speak not; tho' they rage, I know,Can never be convinc'd, yet shall it beConfounded.—And must I renounce my freedom?Forgoe the power of doing general good?Must yield my self the slave, the barbarous triumphOf insolent, enrag'd, inveterate Rome?And all for nothing but to grace thy fall?Nay by my self to perish for thy pleasure?For thee, the Romans may be mild to thee;But I, a Carthaginian, I, whose bloodHolds unrelenting enmity to theirs;Who have my self much hurt them, and who liveAlone to work them woe; what, what can IHope from their vengeance, but the very dregsOf the worst fate, the bitterness of bondage?Yet thou, thou kind man, wouldst in thy generous love,Wouldst have me suffer that; be bound to thee,For that dire end alone, beyond the stretchOf nature, and of law.SYPHAX.Confusion! Law!I know the laws permit thee, the gross lawsThat rule the vulgar. I'm a captive, true;And therefore may'st thou plead a shameful rightTo leave me to my chains—But say, thou base one!Ungrateful! say, for whom am I a captive?For whom these many years with war, and death,Defeats, and desolation have I liv'd?For whom has battle after battle bled?
For whom my crown, my kingdom, and my all,Been vilely cast away? For whom this day,This very day, have I been stain'd with slaughter?With yon last reeking field?—For one, ye gods!Who leaves me for the victor, for the wretchI hold in utter endless detestation.Fire! fury! hell!—Oh I am richly paid!—But thus it is to love a woman—Woman!The source of all disaster, all perdition!Man in himself is social, would be happy,Too happy; but the gods, to keep him down,Curs'd him with woman! fond, enchanting, smooth,And harmless seeming woman; while at heartAll poison, serpents, tygers, furies, allThat is destructive, in one form combin'd,And gilded o'er with beauty!SOPHONISBA.Hapless man!I pity thee; this madness only stirsMy bosom to compassion, not to rage.Think as you list of our unhappy sex,Too much subjected to your tyrant force;Yet know that all, we were not all, at least,Form'd for your trifles, for your wanton hours.Our passions too can sometimes soar aboveThe houshold task assign'd us, can expandBeyond the narrow sphere of families,And take in states into the panting heart,As well as yours, ye partial to yourselves!And this is my support, my joy, my glory,The Conscience that my heart abhors all baseness,And of all baseness most ingratitude.This sure affronted honour may declare,With an unblushing cheek.SYPHAX.False, false as Hell!False as your sex! when it pretends to virtue.You talk of honour, conscience, patriotism.A female patriot!—Vanity!—Absurd!Even doating dull credulity would laugh
To scorn your talk. Was ever Woman yetHad any better purpose in her eye,Than how to please her pride or wanton will?In various shapes, and various manners, all,All the same plagues, or open, or conceal'd,The bane of life!SOPHONISBA.Must I then, must I, Syphax,Give thee a bitter proof of what I say?I would not seem to heighten thy distress,Not in the least insult thee; thou art fallen,So fate severe has will'd it, fallen by me.I therefore have been patient; from another,Such language, such indignity, had fir'dMy soul to madness. But since driven so far,I mu stremind thy blind injurious rageOf our unhappy Marriage.—SYPHAX.Horror!—Oh!Blot it eternal night!SOPHONISBA.Allow me, Syphax!Hear me but once! If what I here declareShines not with reason, and the clearest truth;May I be base, despis'd, and dumb for ever!I pray thee think, when unpropitious HymenOur hands united, how I stood engag'd.I need not mention what full well thou know'st.But pray recal, was I not flatter'd? young?With blooming life elate, with the warm yearsOf vanity? sunk in a passion too,Which few resign? Yet then I married thee,Because to Carthage deem'd a stronger friend;For that alone. On these conditions, say,Didst thou not take me, court me to thy throne?Have I deceiv'd thee since? Have I dissembled?To gain one purpose,  pretended whatI never felt? Thou  say I have.And if that  inspir'dMy marrying  cannot now
Be wrong. Nay since my native city wantsAssistance more, and sinking calls for aid,Must be more right—SYPHAX.This reasoning is insult!SOPHONISBA.I'm sorry that thou dost oblige me to it.Then in a word take my full-open'd soul.All love, but that of Carthage, I despise.I formerly to Masinissa theePreferr'd not, nor to thee now Masinissa,But Carthage to you both. And if preferringThousands to one, a whole collected people,All nature's tenderness, whate'er is sacred,The liberty the welfare of a state,To one man's frantic happiness, be shame;Here, Syphax, I invoke it on my head!This set aside; I, careless of my self,And, scorning prosperous state, had still been thine,In all the depth of misery proudly thine!But since the public good, the law supreme,Forbids it; I will leave thee with a kingdom,The same I found thee, or not reign my self.Alas! I see thee hurt—Why cam'st thou here,Thus to inflame thee more?SYPHAX.Why sorceress? why?Thou complication of all deadly mischief!Thou lying, soothing, specious, charming fury!I'll tell thee why—To breathe my great revenge;To throw this load of burning madness from me;To stab thee!—SOPHONISBA.Ha!—SYPHAX.—And, springing from thy heart,To quench me with thy blood!(Phoenissa interposes)SOPHONISBA.Off, give me way!Phoenissa; tempt not thou his brutal rage.Me, me, he dares not murder: if he dares,Here let his fury strike; for I dare die.What holds thy trembling point?PHOENISSA.Guards!SOPHONISBA.Seize the king.But look you treat him well, with all the stateHis dignity demands.SYPHAX.Goodness from theeIs the worst death,—The Roman trumpets!—Ha!Now I bethink me, Rome will do me justice.Yes, I shall see thee walk the slave of Rome;Forget my wrongs, and glut me with the sight.Be that my best revenge.SOPHONISBA.Inhuman! that,If there is death in Afric, shall not be.SCENE III.LAELIUS, SYPHAX.LAELIUS.Syphax! alas, how fallen! how chang'd! from whatI here beheld thee once in pomp, and splendor;At that illustrious interview, when RomeAnd Carthage met beneath this very roof,Their too great generals, Asdrubal and Scipio,To court thy friendship. Of the same repastBoth gracefully partook, and both reclin'd
On the same couch: for personal distasteAnd hatred seldom burn between the brave.Then the superiour virtues of the RomanGain'd all thy heart. Even Asdrubal himself,With admiration struck and just despair,Own'd him as dreadful at the social feastAs in the battle. This thou may'st remember;And how thy faith was given before the Gods,And sworn and seal'd to Scipio; yet how falseThou since has prov'd, I need not now recount:But let thy sufferings for thy guilt attone,The captive for the king. A Roman tongueScorns to pursue the triumph of the sword,With mean upbraidings.SYPHAX.Laelius, 'tis too true.Curse on the cause!LAELIUS.But where is Masinissa?The brave young victor, the Numidian Roman!Where is he? that my joy, my glad applause,From envy pure, may hail his happy state.Why that contemtuous smile?SYPHAX.Too credulous Roman,I smile to think how that this Masinissa,This Rome-devoted heroe, must still moreAttract thy praises by a late exploit.In every thing successful.LAELIUS.What is this?These public shouts? A strange unusual joyO'er all the captive city blazes wide.What wanton riot reigns to night in Cirtha?Within these conquer'd walls?SYPHAX.This, Laelius, isA night of triumph o'er my conqueror,O'er Masinissa.LAELIUS.Masinissa! How?SYPHAX.Why he to night is married to my queen.LAELIUS.Impossible!—SYPHAX.Yes, she, the fury! she,Who put the nuptial torch into my hand,That set my throne, my palace, and my kingdom,All in a blaze—she now has seiz'd on him.Will turn him soon from Rome—I know her power,Her lips distil unconquerable poison.O glorious thought!—will sink this hated youth,Will crush him deep, beneath the mighty ruinsOf falling Carthage.LAELIUS.Can it be? Amazement!SYPHAX.Nay learn it from himself.—He comes—Away!Ye furies snatch me from his sight! For hell,Its tortures all are gentle to the presenceOf a triumphant rival?LAELIUS.What is man?SCENE IV.MASINISSA, LAELIUS.MASINISSA.Thou more than partner of this glorious day!Which has from Carthage torn her chief support,And tottering left her, I rejoice to see thee—To Cirtha welcome, Laelius.—Thy brave legionsNow taste the sweet repose by valour purchas'd;
This city pours refreshment on their toils.I order'd Narva—LAELIUS.Thanks to Masinissa.All that is well. I here observ'd the king,But loosely guarded. True, indeed, from himThere is not much to fear. The dangerous spirit,Still not unworthy fear, our matchless prize,Is his imperious queen, is Sophonisba.The pride, the rage of Carthage live in her.How? where is she?MASINISSA.She, Laelius? In my care.Think not of her. I'll answer for her conduct.LAELIUS.Yes, if in chains. Till then, believe me, prince,It were as hopeful answering for the winds,That their broad pinions will not rouze the desart;Or that the darted Lightning will be harmless;As promise peace from her.—But why so dark?You shift your place, your countenance grows warm.It is not usual this in Masinissa.Pray what offence can asking for the queen,The Roman captive give?MASINISSA.Laelius, no more.You know my marriage.—Syphax has been busy—It is unkind to dally with my passion.LAELIUS.Ah, Masinissa! was it then for this,Thy hurry hither from the recent battle?Is the first instance of the Roman bountyThus, thus abus'd? They give thee back thy kingdom;And in return are of their captive robb'd;Of all they valued, Sophonisba.—MASINISSA.Robb'd!How, Laelius? Robb'd!LAELIUS.Yes, Masinissa, robb'd.What is it else? But I, this very night,Will here assert the majesty of Rome;And, mark me, tear her from the nuptial bed.MASINISSA.Oh Gods! oh patience! As soon, fiery Roman!As soon thy rage might from her azure sphereTear yonder moon.—The man who seizes her,Shall set his foot first on my bleeding heart.Of that be sure.—And is it thus ye treatYour firm allies? Thus kings in friendship with you?Of human passions strip them?—Slaves indeed!If thus deny'd the common privilegeOf nature, what the weakest creatures claim,A right to what they love.LAELIUS.Out! out!—For shame!This passion makes thee blind. Here is a war,Which desolates the nations, has almostLaid waste the world. How many widows, orphans,And love-lorn virgins pine for it in Rome!Even her great senate droops; her nobles fail;Her Circus shrinks; her every lustre thins,Nature her self, by frequent prodigies,Seems at this havock of her works to sicken:And our Ausonian plains are now becomeA horror to the sight: At each sad step,Remembrance weeps. Yet her, the greatest prizeIt hitherto has yielded; her, whose charmsAre only turn'd to whet its cruel point;Thou to thy wedded breast hast taken her:Hast purchas'd thee her beauties by a seaOf thy protector's blood; and on a throneSet her, this day recover'd by their arms.Canst thou thy self, thou, think of it with patience?Nor to a Roman mention King.—A RomanWould scorn to be a king.—The Roman peopleTook liberty from out the very dust,And for great ages urg'd it to the skies,
The dread of kings!MASINISSA.Be not so haughty, Laelius.It scarce becomes the gentle Scipio's friend;Suits not thy wonted ease, the tender mannersI still have mark'd in thee. I honour Rome;But honour too my self, my vows, my queen:Nor will, nor can, I tamely hear thee threatenTo seize her like a slave.LAELIUS.I will be calm.This thy rash deed, this unexpected shock,Such a peculiar injury to me,Thy friend and fellow-soldier, has perhapsSnatch'd me too far. For hast thou not dishonour'd,By this last action, a successful war?Our common charge, entrusted us by Scipio.MASINISSA.Ay, there it is.—Has not thy vain ambition,(Oh where is friendship!) plan'd her for thy triumph?To think on't, death! to think it is dishonour.At such a sight, the warriour's eye might wetHis burning cheek; and all the Roman matrons,Who line the laurel'd way, asham'd, and fad,Turn from a captive brighter than themselves.But Scipio will be milder.LAELIUS.I disdainThis thy surmise, and give it up to Scipio.Those passions are not comely.—Here to morrowComes the proconsul. Mean time, Masinissa,Ah harden not thy self in flattering hope!Scipio is mild, but steady.—Ha! the queen.I think she hates a Roman.—and will leave thee.SCENE V.SOPHONISBA, MASINISSA.SOPHONISBA.Was not that Roman Laelius, as I enter'd,Who parted gloomy hence?MASINISSA.Madam, the same.SOPHONISBA.Unhappy Afric! since these haughty RomansHave in this lordly manner trod thy courts.I read his fresh reproaches in thy face;The lesson'd pupil in thy fallen look,In that forc'd smile which sickens on thy cheek.MASINISSA.Oh say not so, thou rapture of my soul!For while I see thee, meditate thy charms,I smile as cordial as the sun in may;Deep from the heart, in every sense of joyI fondly smile.SOPHONISBA.Nay, tell me, Masinissa;How feels their tyranny, when 'tis brought home?When, lawless grown, it touches what is dear?Pomp for a while may dazle thoughtless man,False glory blind him; but there is a time,When ev'n the slave in heart will spurn his chains,Nor know submission more.—What said his pride?MASINISSA.His disappointment for a moment onlyBurst in vain passion▪ and—SOPHONISBA.You stood aba'd;
You bore his threats, and tamely-silent heard him,Heard the fierce Roman mark me for his triumph.Oh bitter!MASINISSA.Banish that unkind suspicion.The thought enflam'd my soul. I vow'd my life,My last Massylian to the sword, ere heShou'd touch thy freedom with the least dishonour.But that from Scipio—SOPHONISBA.Scipio!MASINISSA.That from him—SOPHONISBA.I tell thee, Masinissa, if from himI gain my freedom, from my self conceal it.I shall disdain such freedom.MASINISSA.Sophonisba!Thou all my heart holds precious! doubt no more.Nor Rome, nor Scipio, nor a world combin'dShall tear thee from me; till outstretch'd I lie,A nameless wretch!SOPHONISBA.If thy protection fails,Of this at least be sure, be very sure,To give me timely death.MASINISSA.Cease thus to talk,Of death of Romans, of unkind Ambition.My softer thoughts those rugged themes refuse,Can turn alone to love.—All, all, but thee,All nature is a passing dream to me.Fix'd in my view, thou dost for ever shine,Thy form forth-beaming from the soul divine▪A spirit thine, which mortals might adore;Despising love, and thence creating more.Thou the high passions, I the tender prove,Thy heart was form'd for glory, mine for love.The End of the Fourth Act.ACT V. SCENE I.MASINISSA, NARVA.MASINISSA.HAil to the joyous day! With purple clouds,The whole horizon glows. The breezy SpringStands loosely-floating on the mountain-top,And deals her sweets around. The sun too seems,As conscious of my joy, with brighter eyeTo look abroad the world; and all things smileLike Sophonisba. Love and friendship sureHave mark'd this day from out their choicest stores;For beauty rais'd by dignity and virtue,With all the graces all the loves embellish'd;Oh Sophonisba's mine! and Scipio comes!NARVA.My lord, the trumpets speak his near approach.MASINISSA.I want his secret audience—Leave us, Narva.SCENE II.SCIPIO, MASINISSA.MASINISSA.Scipio! more welcome than my tongue can speak!Oh greatly, dearly welcome!SCIPIO.Masinissa!My heart beats back thy joy.—A happy friend,
With laurel green, with conquest crown'd, and glory;Rais'd by his prudence, fortitude, and valour,O'er all his foes; and on his native throne,Amidst his rescu'd shouting subjects, set:Say, can the gods in lavish bounty giveA sight more pleasing?MASINSSSA.My great friend! and patron!It was thy timely thy restoring arm,That brought me from the fearful desart-life;To live again in state, and purple splendor.And now I wield the sceptre of my fathers,See my dear people from the tyrant's scourge,From Syphax freed; I hear their glad applauses;And, to compleat my happiness, have gain'dA friend worth all. O gratitude, esteem,And love like mine, with what divine delightYe fill the heart!SCIPIO.Heroic youth! thy virtueHas earn'd whate'er thy fortune can bestow.It was thy patience, Masinissa, patience,A champion clad in steel, that in the wasteAttended still thy step, and sav'd my friendFor better days. What cannot patience do?A great design is seldom snatch'd at once;'Tis patience heaves it on. From savage nature,'Tis patience that has built up human life,The nurse of arts! and Rome exalts her headAn everlasting monument of patience.MASINISSA.If I have that, or any virtue, Scipio,'Tis copy'd all from thee.SCIPIO.No Masinissa,'Tis all unborrow'd, the spontaneous growthOf nature in thy breast.—Friendship for onceMust, tho' thou blushest, wear a liberal tongue;Must tell thee, noble youth, that long experience,
In councils, battles, many a hard event,Has found thee still so constant, so sincere,So wise, so brave, so generous, so humane,So well attemper'd, and so fitly turn'dFor what is either great or good in life,As casts distinguish'd honour on thy country;And cannot but endear thee to the Romans.For me, I think my labours all repaid,My wars in Afric. Masinissa's friendshipSmiles at my soul. Be that my dearest triumph,To have assisted thy forlorn estate,And lent a happy hand in raising theeTo thy paternal throne, usurp'd by Syphax.The greatest service could be done my country,Distracted Afric, and Mankind in general,Was aiding sure thy cause. To put the power,The public power, into the good man's hand,Is giving plenty, life, and joy to millions.But has my friend, since late we parted armies;Since he with Laelius acted such a brave,Auspicious part against the common foe;Has he been blameless quite? has he consider'd,How pleasure often on the youthful heart,Beneath the rosy soft disguise of love;(All sweetness, smiles, and seeming innocence)Steals unperceiv'd, and lays the victor low?I would not, cannot, put thee to the pain——It pains me deeper—of the least reproach.—Let thy too faithful memory supplyThe rest.(Pausing)Thy silence, that dejected look,That honest colour flushing o'er thy cheek,Impart thy better soul.MASINISSA.Oh my good lord!Oh Scipio! Love has seiz'd me, tyrant loveInthralls my soul. I am undone by love!SCIPIO.And art thou then to ruin reconcil'd?Tam'd to destruction? Wilt thou be undone?
Resign the towering thought? the vast design,With future glories big? the warriour's wreathe?The glittering files? the trumpets sprightly clang?The praise of senates? an applauding world?The patriot's statue, and the heroes triumph?All for a sigh? all for a soft embrace?For a gay transient fancy, Masinissa?For shame, my friend! for honour's sake, for glory!Sit not with folded arms, despairing, weak,And careless all, till certain ruin comes:Like a sick virgin sighing to the gale,Unconquerable love!MASINISSA.How chang'd indeed!The time has been, when, fir'd from Scipio's tongue,My soul had mounted in a flame with his.—Where is ambition flown? Hopeless attempt!Can love like mine be quell'd? Can I forgetWhat still possesses, charms my thoughts for everThrow scornful from me what I hold most dear?Not feel the force of excellence? To joyBe dead? And undelighted with delight?Soft, let me think a moment—no! no! no!—I am unequal to thy virtue, Scipio!SCIPIO.Fie, Masinissa, fie! By heavens! I blushAt thy dejection, this degenerate language.What! perish for a woman! Ruin all,All the fair deeds which an admiring worldHopes from thy rising day; only to soothA stubborn fancy, a luxurious will?How must it, think you, sound in future story?Young Masinissa was a virtuous prince,And Afric smil'd beneath his early ray;But that a Carthaginian captive came,By whom untimely in the common fateOf love he fell. The wise will scorn the page.And all thy praise be some fond maid exclaiming,Where are those lovers now?—O rather, rather,Had I ne'er seen the vital light of heaven,
Than like the vulgar live, and like them die!Ambition sickens at the very thought.—To puff, and bustle here from day to day,Lost in the passions of inglorious life,Joys which the careless brutes possess above us.And when some years, each duller than another,Are thus elaps'd, in nauseous pangs to die;And pass away, like those forgotten things,That soon become as they had never been.MASINISSA.And am I dead to this?SCIPIO.The gods, young man,Who train up heroes in misfortune's school,Have shook thee with adversity, with eachIllustrious evil, that can raise, expand,And fortify the mind. Thy rooted worthHas stood these wintry blasts, grown stronger by them.Shall then in prosperous times, while all is mild,All vernal, fair; and glory blows around thee;Shall then the dead Serene of pleasure come,And lay thy faded honours in the dust?MASINISSA.O gentle Scipio! spare me, spare my weakness.SCIPIO.Remember Hannibal—A signal proof,A fresh example of destructive pleasure.He was the dread of nations, once of Rome!When from Bellona's bosom, nurs'd in camps,And hard with toil, he down the rugged AlpsRush'd in a torrent over Italy;Unconquer'd, till the loose delights of CapuaSunk his victorious arm, his genius broke,Perfum'd, and made a lover of the heroe.And now he droops in Bruttium, fear'd no more,Sinks on our borders like a scatter'd storm.Remember him; and yet resume thy spirit,Ere it is quite dissolv'd.MASINISSA.Shall Scipio stoop,Thus to regard, to teach me wisdom thus;And yet a stupid anguish at my heartRepel whate'er he says?—But why, my lord,Why should we kill the best of passions, love?It aids the heroe, bids ambition rise,Turns us to please, inspires immortal deeds,Even softens brutes, and makes the good more good.SCIPIO.There is a holy tenderness indeed,A nameless sympathy, a fountain-love;Branch'd infinite from parents to their children,From child to child, from kindred on to kindred,In various streams, from citizen to citizen,From friend to friend, from man to man in general;That binds, supports, and sweetens human life.But is thy passion such?—List, Masinissa,While I the hardest office of a friendDischarge; and, with a necessary hand,A hand tho' harsh at present really tender,I paint this passion. And if then thou stillArt bent to sooth it, I must sighing leave thee,To what the Gods think fit.MASINISSA.O never, Scipio!O never leave me to my self! Speak on.I dread, and yet desire thy friendly hand.SCIPIO.I hope that Masinissa need not nowBe told, how much his happiness is mine;With what a warm benevolence I'd springTo raise, confirm it, to prevent his wishes.O luxury to think!—But while he rages,Burns in a fever, shall I let him quaffDelicious poison for a cooling draught,In foolish pity to his thirst? shall ILet a swift flame consume him as he sleeps,Because his dreams are gay? shall I indulgeA frenzy flash'd from an infectious eye?
A sudden impulse unapprov'd by reason?Nay by thy cool deliberate thought condemn'd?Resolv'd against?—A passion for a woman,Who has abus'd thee basely? left thy youth,Thy love as sweet as tender as the spring,The blooming heroe for the hoary tyrant?And now who makes thy sheltering arms aloneHer last retreat, to save her from the vengeance,Which even her very perfidy to theeHas brought upon her head?—Nor is this all.—A woman who will ply her deepest arts,(Ah too prevailing, as appears already)Will never rest, till Syphax' fate is thine;Till friendship weeping flies; we join no moreIn glorious deeds, and thou fall off from Rome?I too could add, that there is something mean,Inhuman in thy passion. Does not Syphax,While thou rejoicest, die? The generous heartShould scorn a pleasure which gives others pain.If this, my friend, all this consider'd deep,Allarm thee not, not rouze thy resolution,And call the heroe from his wanton slumber,Then Masinissa's lost.MASINISSA.Oh, I am pierc'd!In every thought am pierc'd! 'Tis all too true.—I wish I could refuse it.—Whither, whither,Thro' what inchanted wilds have I been wandering?They seem'd Elysium, the delightful plains,The happy groves of heroes and of lovers:But the divinity that breathes in theeHas broke the charm, and I am in a desart;Far from the land of peace. It was but latelyThat a pure joyous calm o'erspread my soul,And reason tun'd my passions into bliss;When love came hurrying in, and with rash hand,Mix'd them delirious, till they now fermentTo misery.—There is no reasoning downThis deep, deep anguish! this continual pang!A thousand things! whene'er my raptur'd thought
Runs back a little.—But I will not think.—And yet I must—Oh Gods! that I could loseWhat a fond few hours memory has grav'dOn adamant.SCIPIO.But one strong effort more,And the fair field is thine—A conquest farExcelling that o'er Syphax. What remains,Since now thy madness to thy self appears,But an immediate manly resolution,To shake off this effeminate disease;These soft ideas, which seduce thy soul,Make it all idle, unaspiring, weak,A scene of dreams; to puff them to the winds,And be my former friend, thy self again?I joy to find thee touch'd by generous motives;And that I need not bid thee recollect,Whose awful property thou hast usurp'd;Need not assure thee, that the Roman people,The senators of Rome, will never sufferA dangerous woman, their devoted foe,A woman, whose irrefragable spiritHas in great part sustain'd this bloody war,Whose charms corrupted Syphax from their side,And fir'd embattled nations into rage;Will never suffer her, when gain'd so dear,To ruin thee too, taint thy faithful breast,And kindle future war. No, fate it selfIs not more steady to the right than they.And, where the public good but seems concern'd,No motive their impenetrable hearts,Nor fear nor tenderness, can touch: such isThe spirit, that has rais'd Imperial Rome.MASINISSA.Ah killing truth!—But I have promis'd, Scipio!Have sworn to save her from the Roman power.My plighted faith is pass'd, my hand is given.And, by the conscious gods! who mark'd my vows▪The whole united world shall never have her.For I will die a thousand thousand deaths,
With all Massylia in one field expire;Ere to the lowest wretch, much more to herI love, to Sophonisba, to my queen,I violate my word.SCIPIO.My heart approvesThy resolution, thy determin'd honour.For ever sacred be thy word, and oath.Virtue by virtue will alone be clear'd,And scorns the crooked methods of dishonour.But, thus divided, how to keep thy faithAt once to Rome and Sophonisba; howTo save her from our chains, and yet thyselfFrom greater bondage; this thy secret thoughtCan best inform thee.MASINISSA.Agony! Distraction!These wilful tears!—O look not on me, Scipio!For I'm a child again.SCIPIO.Thy tears are no reproach.Tears oft look graceful on the manly cheek.The Cruel cannot weep. Even Friendship's eyeGives thee the drop it would refuse itself.I know 'tis hard, wounds every bleeding nerveAbout thy heart, thus to tear off thy passion.But for that very reason, Masinissa,'Tis hop'd from thee. The harder, thence resultsThe greater glory.—Why should we pretendTo conquer, rule mankind, be first in power,In great assemblies, honour, place, and pleasure,While slaves at heart? while by fantastick turnsOur frantic passions rage? The very thoughtShould turn our pomp to shame, our sweet to bitter;And, when the shouts of millions meet our ears,Whisper reproach.—O ye celestial powers!What is it, in a torrent of success,To bear down nations, and o'erflow the world?All your peculiar favour. Real glorySprings from the silent conquest of ourselves;
And without that the conqueror is noughtSave the first slave.—Then rouze thee, Masinissa!Nor in one weakness all thy virtues lose;And oh beware of long, of vain repentance!MASINISSA.Well! well! no more.—It is but dying too!SCENE III.SCIPIO alone.I wish I have not urg'd the truth to rigour!There is a time when virtue grows severe,Too much for nature, and even almost cruel.SCENE IV.SCIPIO, LAELIUS.SCIPIO.Poor Masinissa, Laelius, is undone;Betwixt his passion and his reason tostIn miserable conflict.LAELIUS.Entering, Scipio,He shot athwart me, nor vouchsaf'd one look.Hung on his clouded brow I mark'd despair,And his eye glaring with some dire resolve.Fast o'er his cheek too ran the hasty tear.It were great pity that he should be lost!SCIPIO.By heavens! to lose him were a shock, as ifI lost thee, Laelius, lost my dearest brother,
Bound up in friendship from our infant years.A thousand lovely qualities endear him,Only too warm of heart.LAELIUS.What shall be done?SCIPIO.Here let it rest, till time abates his passion.Nature is nature, Laelius, let the WiseSay what they please. But now perhaps he dies.—Haste! haste! and give him hope—I have not timeTo tell thee what.—Thy prudence will direct—Whatever is consistent with my honour,My duty to the publick, and my friendshipTo him himself, say, promise, shall be done.I hope returning reason will preventOur farther care.LAELIUS.I fly with joy.SCIPIO.His lifeNot only save, but Sophonisba's too:For both I fear are in this passion mixt.LAELIUS.It shall be done.SCENE V.SCIPIO alone.If friendship pierces thus,When love pours in his added violence,What are the pangs which Masinissa feels!SCENE VI.SOPHONISBA, PHOENISSA.SOPHONISBA.Yes, Masinissa loves me—Heavens! how fond!But yet I know not what hangs on my spirit,A dismal boding; for this fatal Scipio,I dread his virtues, this prevailing Roman,Even now perhaps deludes the generous king,Fires his ambition with mistaken glory,Demands me from him; for full well he knows,That, while I live, I must intend their ruin.PHOENISSA.Madam, these fears—SOPHONISBA.And yet it cannot be.Can Scipio, whom even hostile fame proclaimsOf perfect honour, and of polish'd manners,Smooth, artful, winning, moderate, and wise,Make such a wild demand? Or, if he could,Can Masinissa grant it? give his queen,Whom love and honour bind him to protect,Yield her a captive to triumphant Rome?'Tis baseness to suspect it; 'tis inhuman.What then remains?—Suppose they should resolveBy right of war to seize me for their prize.Ay, there it kills!—What can his single arm,Against the Roman power? that very powerBy which he stands restor'd? Distracting thought!Still o'er my head the rod of bondage hangs.Shame on my weakness!—This poor catching hope,This transient taste of joy, will only moreImbitter death.PHOENISSA.A moment will decide.Madam, till then—SOPHONISBA.Would I had dy'd before!And am I dreaming here? Here from the Romans,Beseeching I may live to swell their triumph?When my free spirit should ere now have join'dThat great assembly, those devoted shades,Who scorn'd to live till liberty was lost,But ere their country fell, abhorr'd the light.Whence this pale slave? he trembles with his message.SCENE VII.SOPHONISBA, PHOENISSA; and to them a SLAVE, with a letter and poison from MASINISSA.SLAVE kneeling.This, Madam, from the King, and this.SOPHONISBA.Ha!—Stay—(Reads the Letter.)Rejoice, Phoenissa! Give me joy, my friend!For here is liberty! My fears are air!The hand of Rome can never touch me more!Hail! perfect freedom, hail!PHOENISSA.How? what? my queen!Ah what is this?(Pointing to the poison.)SOPHONISBA.The first of blessings, death.PHOENISSA.Alas! alas! can I rejoice in that?SOPHONISBA.Shift not thy colour at the sound of death;For death appears not in a dreary light,Seem not a blank to me; a losing allThose fond sensations, those enchanting dreams,Which cheat a toiling world from day to day,And form the whole of happiness they know.It is to me perfection, glory, triumph.Nay, fondly would I chuse it, tho' persuadedIt were a long dark night without a morning,To bondage far prefer it! since it isDeliverance from a world where Romans rule,Where violence prevails—And timely too—Before my country falls; before I feelAs many stripes, as many chains, and deaths,As there are lives in Carthage.—Glorious charter!By which I hold immortal life and freedom,Come, let me read thee once again.—And then,To thy great purpose.(Reads the letter aloud.)MASINISSA to his QUEEN.The Gods know with what pleasure I would have kept my faith to Sophonisba in another manner. But since this fatal bowl can alone deliver thee from the Romans: call to mind thy father, thy country, that thou hast been the wife of two kings; and act up to the dictates of thy own heart. I will not long survive thee.Oh, 'tis wondrous well!Ye Gods of death! who rule the Stygian gloom,Ye who have greatly dy'd! I come! I come!I die contented, since I die a queen;By Rome untouch'd, unsullied by their power;So much their terror that I must not live.And thou, go tell the king, if this is allThe nuptial present he can send his bride,I thank him for it—But that death had worn
An easier face before I trusted him.His poison, tell him too, he might have spar'd,These times may want it for himself; and ILive not of such a cordial unprovided.Add, hither had he come, I could have taughtHim how to die.—I linger not, remember,I stand not shivering on the brink of life;And, but these votive drops, which grateful thus (Taking them from the poison)To Jove the high Deliverer I shed,Assure him that I drank it, drank it all,With an unalter'd smile—Away. (Drinks.)SCENE VIII.SOPHONISBA, PHOENISSA.SOPHONISBA.My friend!In tears, my friend! Dishonour not my deathWith womanish complaints. Weep not for me,Weep for thy self, Phoenissa, for thy country,But not for me. There is a certain hour,Which one would wish all undisturb'd and bright,No care, no sorrow, no dejected passions,And that is when we die; when hence we go,Ne'er to be seen again; then let us spreadA bold exalted wing, and the last voiceWe hear be that of wonder and applause.PHOENISSA.Who with the patriot wishes not to die!SOPHONISBA.And is the sacred moment then so near?The moment, when yon sun, those heavens, this earth
Hateful to me, polluted by the Romans,And all the busy slavish race of men,Shall sink at once; and strait another state,New scenes, new joys, new faculties, new wonders,Rise on a sudden round: but this the godsIn clouds and horror wrap, or none would live!How liberal is death!—Methinks, I seemTo touch the happy shore.—Behind me frownsA stormy sea, with tossing mortals thick;While, unconfin'd and green, before me liesThe land of bliss, and everlasting freedom:Where walk the mighty dead; all of one mind,One blooming smile, one language, and one country.Oh to be there!—my breast begins to burn;My tainted heart grows sick.—Ah me! Phoenissa,How many virgins, infants, tender wretches,Must feel these pangs, ere Carthage is no more!Soft—lead me to my couch—My shivering Limbs,Do this last office, and then rest for ever.I pray thee weep not, pierce me not with groans.The king too here.—Nay then my death is full!SCENE IX.SOPHONISBA, PHOENISSA, MASINISSA, LAELIUS, NARVA.MASINISSA.Has Sophonisha drank this cursed bowl?Oh horror! horror! what a sight is here!SOPHONISBA.Had I not drank, Masinissa, then,I had deserv'd it.MASINISSA.Exquisite distress!Oh bitter, bitter fate! And this last hopeCompleats my woe.SOPHONISBA.When will these ears be deaf,To misery's complaint? These eyes be blind,To mischief wrought by Rome?MASINISSA.Too soon! too soon!—Ah why so hasty? But a little while,Hadst thou delay'd this horrid draught; I thenHad been as happy, as I now am wretched!SOPHONISBA.What means this talk of hope? of coward waiting?MASINISSA.What have I done? Oh heavens! I cannot thinkWithout distraction, hell, and burning anguish,On my rash deed!—But, while I talk, she dies!And how? what? where am I then?—Say, canst thouForgive me, Sophonisba?SOPHONISBA.Yes, and more,More than forgive thee, thank thee, Masinissa.Hadst thou been weak, and dally'd with my freedom,Till by proud Rome enslav'd; that injuryI never had forgiven.MASINISSA.I came with life!Laelius and I from Scipio hasted hither;But Death was here before us—this vile poison!SOPHONISBA.With life!—There was some merit in the poison;But this destroys it all.—And couldst thou thinkMe mean enough to take it?—Oh! Phoenissa,This mortal toil is almost at an end.—Receive my parting soul.PHOENISSA.Alas, my queen!MASINISSA.Dies! dies! and scorns me!—Mercy! Sophonisba!Grant one forgiving look, while yet thou canst;Or death it self, the grave cannot relieve me:But with the furies join'd, my frantic ghostWill how for ever.—Quivering! and pale!Have I done this?SOPHONISBA.Come nearer, Masinissa.—Out! stubborn nature!—MASINISSA.Misery! these pangsTo me transfer'd were ease.—A moment only!An agonizing moment! while I haveAn age of things to say!SOPHONISBA.We, but for Rome,Might have been happy.—Rouze thee now, my soul!The cold deliverer comes.—Be mild to Syphax!—In my surviving friend behold me still!—Farewell!—'Tis done.—O never, never, Carthage,Shall I behold thee more!(Dies.)MASINISSA.Dead! dead! oh dead!Is there no death for me?(Snatches Laelius's sword to stab himself.)LAELIUS.Hold, Masinissa!MASINISSA.And wouldst thou make a coward of me, Laelius?Have me survive that murder'd excellence?Did she not stir? Ha! Who has shock'd my brain!It whirls, it blazes.—Was it thou, old man?NARVA.Alas! alas!—good Masinissa, softly!Let me conduct thee to thy couch.MASINISSA.The graveWere welcome.—But ye cannot make me live!Oppress'd with life!—Off!—crowd not thus around me!For I will hear, see, think no more!—Thou sun,Keep up thy hated beams! And all I wantOf thee, kind earth, is an immediate grave!Ay, there she lyes!—Why to that pallid sweetnessCan not I, Nature! lay my lips, and die!(Throws himself beside her.)LAELIUS.See there the ruins of the noble mind,When from calm reason passion tears the sway.What pity she should perish!—Cruel war,'Tis not the least misfortune in thy train,That oft by thee the brave destroy the brave.She had a Roman soul; for every oneWho loves, like her, his country is a Roman.Whether on Afric's sandy plains he glows,Or lives untam'd among Riphoean snows;If parent-liberty the breast inflame,The gloomy Libyan then deserves that name:And, warm with freedom, under frozen skies,In farthest Britain Romans yet may rise.The End of the Fifth Act.EPILOGUE.By a FRIEND.Spoken by Mrs. CIBBER.NOW, I'm afraid, the modest taste in vogueDemands a strong, high-season'd epilogue.Else might some silly soul take pity's part,And odious virtue sink into the heart.Our squeamish author scruples this proceeding;He says it hurts sound morals, and good breeding:Nor Sophonisba would he here produce,A glaring model, of no private use.Ladies, he bid me say, behold your Cato.What tho' no Stoic she, nor read in Plato?Yet sure she offer'd, for her country's sake,A sacrifice, which Cato could not make——Already, now, these wicked men are sneering,Some wresting what one says, and others leering.I vow they have not strength for—public spirit.That, ladies, must be your superior merit.Mercy forbid! we should lay down our lives;Like these old, Punic, barbarous, heathen wives.Spare christian blood.—But sure the devil's in her,Who for her country would not lose a pinner.—Lard! how could such a creature shew her face?How?—Just as you do there—thro' Brussels Lace.The Roman fair, the public in distress,Gave up the dearest ornaments of dress.
How much more cheaply might you gain applause?—One yard of Ribban, and two ells of Gause.And Gause each deep-read critic must adore;Your Roman ladies dress'd in Gause all o'er.Should you, fair patriots, come to dress so thin;How clear might all your—sentiments be seen.To foreign looms no longer owe your charms;Nor make their trade more fatal than their arms.Each British dame, who courts her country's praise,By quitting these outlandish modes, might raise(Not from yon powder'd band, so thin, and spruce)Ten able-bodied men, for—public use.But now a serious word about the play.—Auspicious smile on this his first essay,Ye generous Britons! your own sons inspire;Let your applauses fan their native fire.Then other Shakespears yet may rouze the stage,And other Otways melt another age.FINIS.A NUPTIAL SONG, intended to have been inserted in the Fourth Act.COME, gentle Venus! and asswageA warring world, a bleeding age.For nature lives beneath thy ray,The wintry tempests haste away,A lucid calm invests the sea,Thy native deep is full of thee;And flowering earth, where'er you fly,Is all o'er spring, all sun the sky.A genial spirit warms the breeze;Unseen, among the blooming trees,The feather'd lovers tune their throat,The desart growls a soften'd note,Glad o'er the meads the cattle bound,And love and harmony go round.But chief, into the human heartYou strike the dear delicious dart;You teach us pleasing pangs to know,To languish in luxurious woe,To feel the generous passions rise,Grow good by gazing, mild by sighs;Each happy moment to improve,And fill the perfect year with love.Come, thou delight of heaven and earth!To whom all creatures owe their birth;Oh come, red-smiling! tender, come!And yet prevent our final doom.For long the furious god of warHas crush'd us with his iron car,Has rag'd along our ruin'd plains,Has curs'd them with his cruel stains,Has clos'd our youth in endless sleep,And made the widow'd virgin weep.
Now let him feel thy wonted charms;Oh take him to thy twining arms!And, while thy bosom heaves on his,While deep he prints the humid kiss,Ah then! his stormy heart controul,And sigh thy self into his soul.Thy son too, Cupid, we implore,To leave the green Idalian shore;Be he, sweet god! our only foe;Long let him draw the twanging bow,Transfix us with his golden darts,Pour all his quiver on our hearts,With gentler anguish make us sigh,And teach us sweeter deaths to die.ERRATA.PAGE 3.
