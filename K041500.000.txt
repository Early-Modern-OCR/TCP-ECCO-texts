(Price One Shilling.)THE PLEASURES OF MELANCHOLY.MOther of Musings, Contemplation sage,Whose mansion is upon the topmost cliffOf cloud-capt Teneriff, in secret bow'r;Where ever wrapt in meditation high,Thou hear'st unmov'd, in dark tempestuous night,The loud winds howl around, the beating rainAnd the big hail in mingling storm descendUpon his horrid brow. But when the skiesUnclouded shine, and thro' the blue serenePale Cynthia rolls her silver-axled car,Then ever looking on the spangled vaultRaptur'd thou sit'st, while murmurs indistinctOf distant billows sooth thy pensive earWith hoarse and hollow sounds; secure, self-blest,Oft too thou listen'st to the wild uproarOf fleets encount'ring, that in whispers lowAscends the rocky summit, where thou dwell'stRemote from man, conversing with the spheres.O lead me, black-brow'd , to solemn gloomsCogenial with my soul, to chearless shades,To ruin'd seats, to twilight cells and bow'rs,Where thoughtful Melancholy loves to muse,Her fav'rite midnight haunts. The laughing scenesOf purple Spring, where all the wanton trainOf Smiles and Graces seem to lead the danceIn sportive round, while from their hands they show'rAmbrosial blooms and flow'rs, no longer charm;Tempe, no more I court thy balmy breeze,Adieu green vales! embroider'd meads adieu!Beneath yon' ruin'd Abbey's moss-grown pilesOft let me sit, at twilight hour of Eve,Where thro' some western window the pale moonPours her long-levell'd rule of streaming light;While sullen sacred silence reigns around,Save the lone Screech-owl's note, whose bow'r is builtAmid the mould'ring caverns dark and damp,And the calm breeze, that rustles in the leavesOf flaunting Ivy, that with mantle greenInvests some sacred tow'r. Or let me treadIt's neighb'ring walk of pines, where stray'd of oldThe cloyster'd brothers: thro' the gloomy voidThat far extends beneath their ample archAs on I tread, religious horror wrapsMy soul in dread repose. But when the worldIs clad in Midnight's raven-colour'd robe,In hollow charnel let me watch the flameOf taper dim, while airy voices talkAlong the glimm'ring walls, or ghostly shapeAt distance seen, invites with beck'ning handMy lonesome steps, thro' the far-winding vaults.Nor undelightful is the solemn noonOf night, when haply wakeful from my couchI start: lo, all is motionless around!Roars not the rushing wind, the sons of menAnd every beast in mute oblivion lie;All Nature's hush'd in silence and in sleep.O then how fearful is it to reflect,That thro' the solitude of the still globeNo Being wakes but me! 'till stealing sleepMy drooping temples baths in opiate dews.Nor then let dreams, of wanton Folly born,My senses lead thro' flowery paths of joy;But let the sacred Genius of the nightSuch mystic visions send, as SPENSER saw,When thro' bewild'ring Fancy's magic maze,To the bright regions of the fairy worldSoar'd his creative mind: or MILTON knew,When in abstracted thought he first conceiv'dAll heav'n in tumult, and the SeraphimCome tow'ring, arm'd in adamant and gold.Let others love the Summer-ev'ning's smiles,As list'ning to some distant water-fallThey mark the blushes of the streaky west:I choose the pale December's foggy glooms;Then, when the sullen shades of Ev'ning close,Where thro' the room a blindly-glimm'ring gleamThe dying embers scatter, far remoteFrom Mirth's mad shouts, that thro' the lighted roofResound with festive echo, let me sit,Blest with the lowly cricket's drowsy dirge.Then let my contemplative thought exploreThis fleeting state of things, the vain delights,The fruitless toils, that still elude our search,As thro' the wilderness of life we rove.This sober hour of silence will unmaskFalse Folly's smiles, that like the dazling spellsOf wily Comus, cheat th' unweeting eyeWith blear illusion, and persuade to drinkThe charmed cup, that Reason's mintage fairUnmoulds, and stamps the monster on the man.Eager we taste, but in the luscious draughtForget the pois'nous dregs that lurk beneath.Few know that Elegance of soul refin'd,Whose soft sensation feels a quicker joyFrom Melancholy's scenes, than the dull prideOf tasteless splendor and magnificenceCan e'er afford. Thus Eloise, whose mindHad languish'd to the pangs of melting love,More secret transport found, as on some tombReclin'd she watch'd the tapers of the dead,Or thro' the pillar'd isles, amid the shrinesOf imag'd saints, and intermingled graves,Which scarce the story'd windows dim disclos'd,Musing she wander'd; than Cosmelia finds,As thro' the Mall in silken pomp array'd,She floats amid the gilded sons of dress,And shines the fairest of th' assembled Belles.When azure noon-tide chears the daedal globe,And the glad regent of the golden dayRejoices in his bright meridian bow'r,How oft my wishes ask the night's return,That best befriends the melancholy mind!Hail, sacred Night! to thee my song I raise!Sister of ebon-scepter'd Hecat, hail!Whether in congregated clouds thou wrap'stThy viewless chariot, or with silver crownThy beaming head encirclest, ever hail!What tho' beneath thy gloom the Lapland witchOft celebrates her moon-eclipsing rites;Tho' Murther wan, beneath thy shrouding shadeOft calls her silent vot'ries to deviseOf blood and slaughter, while by one blue lampIn secret conf'rence sits the list'ning band,And start at each low wind, or wakeful sound:What tho' thy stay the Pilgrim curses oft,As all benighted in Arabian wastesHe hears the howling wilderness resoundWith roaming monsters, while on his hoar headThe black-descending tempest ceaseless beats;Yet more delightful to my pensive mindIs thy return, than bloomy Morn's approach,When from the portals of the saffron EastShe sheds fresh roses and ambrosial dews.Yet not ungrateful is the Morn's approach,When dropping wet she comes, and clad in clouds,While thro' the damp air scowls the peevish South,And the dusk landschape rises dim to view.Th' afflicted songsters of the sadden'd grovesHail not the sullen gloom, but silent droop;The waving elms, that rang'd in thick array,Enclose with stately row some rural hall,Are mute, nor echo with the clamors hoarseOf rooks rejoicing on their hoary boughs:While to the shed the dripping poultry croud,A mournful train: secure the village-hindHangs o'er the crackling blaze, nor tempts the storm;Rings not the high wood with enliv'ning shoutsOf early hunter: all is silence drear;And deepest sadness wraps the face of things.Thro' POPE's soft song tho' all the Graces breath,And happiest art adorn his Attic page;Yet does my mind with sweeter transport glow,As at the foot of some hoar oak reclin'd,In magic SPENSER's wildly-warbled songI see deserted Una wander wideThro' wasteful solitudes, and lurid heaths,Weary, forlorn, than when the Belinda. Vid. Rape of the Lock. fated Fair,Upon the bosom bright of silver Thames,Launches in all the lustre of Brocade,Amid the splendors of the laughing Sun.The gay description palls upon the sense,And coldly strikes the mind with feeble bliss.O wrap me then in shades of darksom pine,Bear me to caves by desolation brown,To dusky vales, and hermit-haunted rocks!And hark, methinks resounding from the gloomThe voice of Melancholy strikes mine ear;"Come, leave the busy trifles of vain life,"And let these twilight mansions teach thy mind"The Joys of Musing, and of solemn Thought."Ye youths of Albion's beauty-blooming isle,Whose brows have worn the wreath of luckless love,Is there a pleasure like the pensive mood,Whose magic wont to sooth your soften'd souls?O tell how rapt'rous is the deep-felt blissTo melt to Melody's assuasive voice,Careless to stray the midnight mead along,And pour your sorrows to the pitying moon,Oft interrupted by the Bird of Woe!To muse by margin of romantic stream,To fly to solitudes, and there forgetThe solemn dulness of the tedious world,'Till in abstracted dreams of fancy lost,Eager you snatch the visionary fair,And on the phantom feast your cheated gaze!Sudden you start—th' imagin'd joys recede,The same sad prospect opens on your sense;And nought is seen but deep-extended treesIn hollow rows, and your awaken'd earAgain attends the neighb'ring fountain's sound.These are delights that absence drear has madeFamiliar to my soul, er'e since the formOf young Sapphira, beauteous as the Spring,When from her vi'let-woven couch awak'dBy frolic Zephyr's hand, her tender cheekGraceful she lifts, and blushing from her bow'r,Issues to cloath in gladsome-glist'ring greenThe genial globe, first met my dazled sight.These are delights unknown to minds profane,And which alone the pensive soul can taste.The taper'd choir, at midnight hour of Pray'r,Oft let me tread, while to th' according voiceThe many-sounding organ peals on high,In full-voic'd chorus thro' th' embowed roof;'Till all my soul is bath'd in ecstasies,And lap'd in Paradise. Or let me sitFar in some distant isle of the deep dome,There lonesome listen to the solemn sounds,Which, as they lengthen thro' the Gothic vaults,In hollow murmurs reach my ravish'd ear.Nor let me fail to cultivate my mindWith the soft thrillings of the tragic Muse,Divine Melpomene, sweet Pity's nurse,Queen of the stately step, and flowing pall.Now let Monimia mourn with streaming eyesHer joys incestuous, and polluted love:Now let Calista dye the desperate steelWithin her bosom, for lost innocence,Unable to behold a father weep.Or Jaffeir kneel for one forgiving look;Nor seldom let the Moor on DesdemonePour the misguided threats of jealous rage.By soft degrees the manly torrent stealsFrom my swoln eyes, and at a brother's woeMy big heart melts in sympathizing tears.What are the splendors of the gaudy court,It's tinsel trappings, and it's pageant pomps?To me far happier seems the banish'd LordAmid Siberia's unrejoycing wildsWho pines all lonesome, in the chambers hoarOf some high castle shut, whose windows dimIn distant ken discover trackless plains,Where Winter ever drives his icy car;While still repeated objects of his view,The gloomy battlements, and ivied tow'rsThat crown the solitary dome, arise;While from the topmost turret the slow clockFar heard along th' inhospitable wastesWith sad-returning chime, awakes new grief;Than is the Satrap whom he left behindIn Moscow's regal palaces, to drownIn ease and luxury the laughing hours.Illustrious objects strike the gazer's mindWith feeble bliss, and but allure the sight,Nor rouze with impulse quick the feeling heart.Thus seen by shepherd from Hymettus' brow,What painted landschapes spread their charms beneath?Here palmy groves, amid whose umbrage greenTh' unfading olive lifts her silver head,Resounding once with Plato's voice, arise:Here vine-clad hills unfold their purple stores,Here fertile vales their level lap expand,Amid whose beauties glistering Athens tow'rs.Tho' thro' the graceful seats Ilissus rollHis sage-inspiring flood, whose fabled banksThe spreading laurel shades, tho' roseate MornPour all her splendors on th' empurpled scene,Yet feels the musing Hermit truer joys,As from the cliff that o'er his cavern hangs,He views the piles of fall'n PersepolisIn deep arrangement hide the darksome plain.Unbounded waste! the mould'ring ObeliscHere, like a blasted oak, ascends the clouds;Here Parian domes their vaulted halls discloseHorrid with thorn, where lurks the secret thief,Whence flits the twilight-loving bat at eve,And the deaf adder wreaths her spotted train,The dwellings once of Elegance and Art.Here temples rise, amid whose hallow'd boundsSpires the black pine, while thro' the naked street,Haunt of the tradeful merchant, springs the grass:Here columns heap'd on prostrate columns, tornFrom their firm base, encrease the mould'ring mass.Far as the sight can pierce, appear the spoilsOf sunk magnificence: a blended sceneOf moles, fanes, arches, domes, and palaces,Where, with his brother horror, ruin sits.O come then, Melancholy, queen of thought,O come with saintly look and stedfast step,From forth thy cave embower'd with mournful yew,Where ever to the cu soundList'ning thou sitt'st, and ress bindThy votary's hair, and seal him sy son.But never let Euphrosyne beguileWith toys of wanton mirth my fixed mind,Nor with her primrose garlands strew my paths.What tho' with her the dimpled Hebe dwells,With young-ey'd Pleasure, and the loose-rob'd Joy;Tho' Venus, mother of the Smiles and Loves,And Bacchus, ivy-crown'd, in myrtle bow'rWith her in dance fantastic beat the ground:What tho' 'tis her's to calm the blue serene,And at her presence mild the low'ring cloudsDisperse in air, and o'er the face of heav'nNew day diffusive glows at her approach;Yet are these joys that Melancholy gives,By Contemplation taught, her sister sage,Than all her witless revels happier far.Then ever, beauteous Contemplation, hail!From thee began, auspicious maid, my song,With thee shall end: for thou art fairer farThan are the nymphs of Cirrha's mossy grot;To loftier rapture thou canst wake the thought,Than all the fabling Poet's boasted pow'rs.Hail, queen divine! whom, as tradition tells,Once in his ev'ning-walk a Druid foundFar in a hollow glade of Mona's woods,And piteous bore with hospitable handTo the close shelter of his oaken bow'r.There soon the Sage admiring mark'd the dawnOf solemn Musing in thy pensive thought;For when a smiling babe, you lov'd to lieOft deeply list'ning to the rapid roarOf wood-hung Meinai, stream of Druids old,That lav'd his hallow'd haunt with dashing wave.FINIS.
