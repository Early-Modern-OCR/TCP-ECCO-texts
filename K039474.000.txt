MATILDA: A TRAGEDY. AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE.By the AUTHOR of the EARL of WARWICK.LONDON: Printed for T. CADELL, opposite Catherine-Street, in the Strand. 1775. [PRICE ONE SHILLING AND SIX-PENCE.]DEDICATION.TO THE PUBLIC.SIR,PERMIT me to return you my unfeigned thanks for your kind reception of this Tragedy on the stage, and to request the continuance of your favour to it in the closet. It would be the highest ingratitude in me to forget the only patron I ever had the good fortune to meet with, by whose powerful assistance I have been enabled to defeat the combined forces of envy, malice and detraction. I must at the same time fairly confess, my victory over the enemy was owing, I believe, as many other victories have been, more to the art and prowess of my Officers than to any extraordinary merit of my own. To the first in command, Miss YOUNGE, I have infinite obligations, which I shall always gratefully acknowledge, tho' I may never have it in my power to repay them; nor can the skill and conduct of my generals, REDDISH, SMITH and PALMER, be sufficiently admired. To your patronage and protection I most heartily and sincerely recommend them: If I have been the happy instrument of giving them a favourable opportunity of rising in your esteem, it will give me the greatest satisfaction. You can best distinguish their merit, and you alone are able to reward it.I am, Sir, your much obliged, And devoted humble Servant, The Author.Dramatis Personae.MEN.MORCAR, Earl of Mercia,Mr. REDDISH.EDWIN, Earl of Northumberland,Mr. SMITH.SIWARD, Morcar's friend,Mr. PALMER.OFFICERS, &c. WOMEN.MATILDA, A prisoner in the camp of Morcar,Miss YOUNGE.BERTHA, Her friend,Miss PLATT.SCENE, MORCAR's Camp, and the Environs near NOTTINGHAM.PROLOGUE.Written by a FRIEND.Spoken by Mr. SMITH.A Tragic Tale, from Norman William's Age,Simple, and unadorn'd, attempts the Stage.Our silly Bard, more simple than his Tale,Thinks on your polish'd Manners to prevail;What in those barb'rous Days were counted Crimes,Are Slips of course in these enlighten'd Times:Let not your Ancestors too rude appear,Though firm in Friendship, and in Love sincere.Love then like Glory did each Heart inflame,Beauty was Virtue, and to win it, Fame,Now Lovers lose their Mistresses with Grace,As at New-Market they would lose a Race,Where, if in Hopes they seem a little cross'd,'Tis for the Money of the Match that's lost.When Tilts and Tournaments call'd forth the Brave,The Fame of spotless Innocence to save,Each gallant Knight preferr'd his Love to Life,For then the greatest Blessing was a Wife:To prove their Chastity the dauntless FairWould walk through Flames, nor singe a single Hair;Nay, some so chaste, so cold to all Desire,Not only scap'd it, they put out the Fire!But now no Heroes die for Love's sweet Passion,And fiery Trials are quite out of Fashion.Ye Sons of Frailty—you whom Rage devours,For yo this Night the Muse exerts her Pow'rs;
With crimson Hands, pale Cheeks, and blood-shot Eyes,She bids the Furies in their Terrors rise!In Valour's Breast their Scorpion Stings they dart,First fire the Brain, and then corrupt the Heart.But what avails all Virtue! Passion's gust,Like Whirlwinds, drive it from the Heart like Dust;When Reason dawns, well may Repentance mournLove, Friendship, Duty, by the Roots up-torn.To sooth this fatal Vice, the Flatterer tellsIn stormy Minds how warmest Friendship dwells;The Tree whose sheltering Arms spread kindly round,If Light'ning-struck, lies blasted on the Ground;In vain will Merits past Indulgence claim,One Moment's Rashness blasts whole Years of Fame.EPILOGUE.By the AUTHOR of the TRAGEDY.Spoken by Miss YOUNGE.HA! ha! poor Creature! how you trembling stand!Come to the Bar, Sir, and hold up your Hand;You won't—by Council then you'd have it done,And I must plead your Cause—well, get you gone.[Coming forward to the Audience.Now for the great Tribunal of Old Drury;Are you all sworn there—Gem'men of the Jury?Good Men, and true, I hope—stay, let me see,Amongst you all he challenges—but three.Physicians, Lawyers, Parsons he admits,Beaux, Ladies, Courtiers, Macaronies, Cits,And only scratches—Critics, News-writers, and Wits.The Critic first we banish from our Session,Death is his Trade, and Damning—his Profession;Disqualisy'd—because, to say no further,Butchers are never heard in case of Murther.Next we disclaim th' Artificers of News,Who live by Fibs, and flourish by Abuse;They must condemn, or lose their daily Bread;If they don't cut, and slash—they're never read;Like fabled Giants here they roam for Food,And Fe! Fa! Fum! snuff up an Author's Blood;In the next Ledger hang him up to roast,Or tear him Piece-meal in—the Morning Post.To Wits we last except, and 'bove all other,The Hero of our Tale—a Rival Brother!
As Rogues, just 'scap'd the Gallows, join the Shrieves,Turn Hangmen, and tuck up their Fellow Thieves;So Bards condemn'd, exert the Critic's Skill,And execute their Brethren of the Quill!If like their own, indeed, the Brat should die,They'll gladly join to write—its Elegy;But if the Child is strong, and like to live,That is a Crime they never can forgive.From such let English Juries still be free,Our Author here appeals to your Decree,The Public is—a Court of Equity.If he has shock'd your Taste, your Sense, or Reason,Or against Nature guilty been of Treason,Off with his Head;—but if with honest ArtHis well-meant Scenes have touch'd the feeling Heart;If they have rais'd your Pity, wak'd your Fears,Or sweetly have "beguil'd you of your Tears,"Let venial Errors your Indulgence claim,Your Voice his Triumph, your Applause his Fame.Speak by your Foreman—what says Goodman Pit?Will you condemn the Prisoner, or acquit?Your Verdict, Sirs, Not Guilty—if you please—You smile—Acquitted—hope you'll pay his Fees.
MATILDA: A TRAGEDY.The reader will meet with some lines which, to shorten the scenes, were omitted in the representation.ACT I.SCENE, MATILDA'S Tent, with a view of the distant country.MATILDA, BERTHA.MATILDA.I Thank thee, gentle Bertha, for thy goodness;If aught cou'd sooth the anguish of my soul,Or raise it from the horrors of despairTo hope and joy, 'twou'd be thy gen'rous friendship:But I am sunk so deep in misery,That comfort cannot reach me.BERTHA.Talk not thus,My sweet Matilda; innocence, like thine,Must be the care of all-directing heav'n.Already hath the interposing handOf providence redeem'd thee from the rageOf savage war, and shelter'd thee withinThis calm asylum. Mercia's potent Earl,The noble Morcar, will protect thy virtues;
And, if I err not, wishes but to shareHis conquests with thee.MATILDA.O my friend, oft timesThe flow'ry path that tempts our wand'ring stepsBut leads to mis'ry; what thou fondly deem'stMy soul's best comfort, is its bitt'rest woe.Earl Morcar loves me. To the gen'rous mindThe heaviest debt is that of gratitude,When 'tis not in our power to repay it.BERTHA.Oft' have I heard thee say, to him thou ow'stThy honour and thy life.MATILDA.I told thee truth.Beneath my father's hospitable roof,I spent my earlier happier days in peaceAnd safety: When the Norman conqu'ror came,Discord, thou know'st, soon lit her fatal torch,And spread destruction o'er this wretched land.The loyal Ranulph flew to William's aid,And left me to a faithful peasant's care,Who liv'd, sequester'd, in the fertile plainsOf rich Northumbria: There awhile I dweltIn sweet retirement, when the savage MalcolmRush'd on our borders.BERTHA.I remember wellThe melancholy hour. Confusion rag'dOn ev'ry side, and desolation spreadIts terrors round us. How did'st thou escape?MATILDA.A crew of desp'rate ruffians seiz'd upon me,A helpless prey: For, O! he was not there,Who best cou'd have defended his Matilda.
Then had I fall'n a wretched sacrificeTo rbutal rage, and lawless violence,Had not the gen'rous Morcar interpos'dTo save me: Tho' he join'd the guilty causeOf foul rebellion, yet his soul abhor'dSuch violation. At his awful voiceThe surly ruffians left me, and retir'd.He bore me, half expiring in his arms,Back to his tent; with ev'ry kind attentionThere strove to sooth my griefs, and promis'd, soonAs fit occasion offer'd, to restore meTo my afflicted father.BERTHA.Something sureWas due to gen'rous Morcar for his aid,So timely given.MATILDA.No doubt: But mark what follow'd.In my deliverer too soon I foundAn ardent lover, sighing at my feet.BERTHA.And what is there the proudest of our sexCou'd wish for more? To be the envy'd brideOf noble Morcar, first of England's peers,In fame and fortune.MATILDA.Never trust, my Bertha,To outward shew. 'Tis not the smiles of fortune,The pomp of wealth, or splendor of a court,Can make us happy. In the mind alone,Rests solid joy, and true felicity,Which I can never taste: For, O, my friend!A secret sorrow weighs upon my heart.BERTHA.Then pour it in the bosom of thy friend;Let me partake it with thee.MATILDA.Gen'rous maid!Know then, for nought will I conceal from thee,I honour Mercia's Earl, revere his virtues,And wish I cou'd repay him with myself;But, blushing, I acknowledge it, the heartHis vows solicit, is not mine to give.BERTHA.Has then Tome happier youth—MATILDA.Another timeI'll tell thee all the story of our loves.But, O, my Bertha! did'st thou know to whomMy virgin faith is plighted, thou wou'd'st sayI am indeed unhappy.BERTHA.Cou'd MatildaBestow the treasure of her heart on oneUnworthy of her choice?MATILDA.Unworthy! No.I glory in my passion for the best,The loveliest of his sex. O! he was allThat bounteous nature, prodigal of charms,Did on her choicest fav'rite e'er bestow.His graceful form and sweet deportment spokeThe fairer beauties of his kindred soul,Where e'vry grace and ev'ry virtue shone.But thou wilt tremble, Bertha, when I tell thee,He is Earl Morcar's—brother.BERTHA.Ha! his brother!The noble Edwin! Often have I heardMy father—MATILDA.Did Lord Edrick know him then?BERTHA.He knew his virtues, and his fame in arms,And often wou'd lament the dire effectsOf civil discord, that cou'd thus dissolveThe ties of nature, and of brethren makeThe bitt'rest foes. If right I learn, Lord EdwinIs William's firmest friend, and still supportsHis royal master.MATILDA.Yes, my Bertha, thereI still find comfort: Edwin ne'er was stain'dAs Morcar is, with foul disloyalty,But stands betwixt his sov'reign and the rageOf rebel multitudes, to guard his throne.If nobly fighting in his country's cause,My hero falls, I shall not weep alone;The king he lov'd and honour'd, will lament him,And grateful England mix her tears with mine.BERTHA.And doth Earl Morcar know of Edwin's love?MATILDA.O, no! I wou'd not for a thousand worldsHe shou'd suspect it, lest his fiery soulShou'd catch th' alarm, and kindle to a flameThat might destroy us all.BERTHA.I know his warmthAnd vehemence of temper, unrestrain'd
By laws, and spurning at the royal pow'rWhich he contemns, he rules despotic here.MATILDA.Alas! how man from man, and brother oftFrom brother differs! Edwin's tender passionIs soft and gentle as the balmy breathOf vernal zephyrs; whilst the savage north,That curls the angry ocean into storms,Is a faint image of Earl Morcar's love:'Tis rage, 'tis fury all. When last we metHe knit his angry brow, and frown'd severeUpon me; then, with wild distracted look,Bade me beware of trifling with his passion,He wou'd not brook it—trembling I retir'd,And bath'd my couch in tears.BERTHA.Unhappy maid!But time, that softens ev'ry human woe,Will bring some blest event, and lighten thine.MATILDA.Alas! thou know'st not what it is to love.Haply thy tender heart hath never feltThe tortures of that soul-bewitching passion.Its joys are sweet and poignant, but its pangsAre exquisite, as I have known too well:For, O! my Bertha, since the fatal hourWhen Edwin left me, never hath sweet peace,That us'd to dwell with all its comforts here,'E'er deign'd to visit this afflicted breast.BERTHA.Too plain, alas! I read thy sorrows; griefSits in sad triumph on thy faded cheek,And half obscures the lustre of thy beauties.MATILDA.Talk not of beauty, 'tis our sex's bane,And leads but to destruction. I abhorThe fatal gift. O! would it had pleas'd heav'nTo brand my homely features with the markOf foul deformity, or let me passUnknown, and undistinguish'd from the herdOf vulgar forms, save by the partial eyeOf my lov'd Edwin; then had I been blestWith charms unenvy'd, and a guiltless love.BERTHA.Where is thy Edwin now?MATILDA.Alas! I know not.'Tis now three years since last these eyes beheldTheir dearest object. In that humble vale,Whence, as I told thee, Malcolm's fury drove me,There first we met. O! how I cherish stillThe fond remembrance! There we first exchang'dOur mutual vows, the day of happinessWas fixt; it came, and in a few short hoursHe had been made indissolubly mine,When fortune, envious of our happiness,And William's danger, call'd him to the field.BERTHA.And since that parting have ye never met?MATILDA.O never, Bertha, never but in thought.Imagination, kind anticipatorOf love's pleasures, brings us oft' together.Oft' as I sit within my lonely tent,And cast my wishful eyes o'er yonder plain,In ev'ry passing traveller I strive
To trace his image, hear his lovely voiceIn ev'ry sound, and fain wou'd flatter meEdwin still lives, still loves his lost Matilda.BERTHA.Who knows but fate, propitious to thy love,May guide him hither.MATILDA.Gracious heav'n forbid!Consider, Bertha, if the chance of warShou'd this way lead him, he must come in armsAgainst his brother: Oh! 'tis horribleTo think on. Shou'd they meet, and Edwin fall,What shall support me? And if vict'ry smilesUpon my love, how dear will be the purchaseBy Morcar's blood! Then must I lose my friend,My guardian, my protector—ev'ry wayMatilda must be wretched.BERTHA.Is there oughtIn Bertha's pow'r?MATILDA.Wilt thou dispatch, my friend,Some trusty messenger with these?—Away.(gives her letters.I'll meet thee in my tent—farewel.[Exit Bertha.MATILDA. (alone.)Mean timeOne hope remains, the gen'rous Siward—heMight save me still. His sympathetic heartCan feel for the afflicted.—I have heard,(Such is the magic pow'r of sacred friendship)When the impetuous Morcar scatters fearAnd terror round him, he, and he alone
Can stem the rapid torrent of his passion,And bend him, tho' reluctant, to his will;And see, in happy hour, he comes this way.Now fortune, be propitious! if there be,As I have heard, an eloquence in grief,And those can most persuade, who are most wretched,I shall not pass unpitied.Enter SIWARD.SIWARD.Ha! in tears,Matilda! What new grief, what cruel foeTo innocence and beauty, thus cou'd vexThy gentle spirit?MATILDA.Canst thou ask the cause,When thou behold'st me still in shameful bonds,A wretched captive, friendless and forlorn,Without one ray of hope to sooth my sorrows.SIWARD.Can she, whose beauteous form, and fair demeanor,Charm ev'ry eye, and conquer ev'ry heart,Can she be wretched? can she want a friend,Whom Siward honours, and whom Morcar loves?O! if thou knew'st with what unceasing ardor,What unexampled tenderness and truth,He doats upon thee, sure thou might'st be wroughtAt least to pity.MATILDA.Urge no more, my Lord,Th' ungrateful subject; but too well I knowHow much thy friend deserves, how much, alas,I owe him!—If it be Earl Morcar's wish
To make me happy, why am I detain'dA pris'ner here: Spight of his solemn promiseHe would restore me to my royal master,Or send me back to the desiring armsOf the afflicted Ranulph, who in tearsOf bitt'rest anguish, mourns his long-lost daughter?Surely, my Lord, it ill becomes a soldierTo forfeit thus his honor and his word.SIWARD.I own it; yet the cause pleads strongly for him.If by thy own too pow'rful charms misled,He deviates from the paths of rigid honour,Matilda might forgive. Thou know'st he livesBut in thy smiles; his love-enchanted soulHangs on those beauties he wou'd wish to keepFor ever in his sight.MATILDA.Indulgent heav'nKeep me for ever from it! O, my Lord!If e'er thy heart with gen'rous pity glow'dFor the distress'd; if e'er thy honest zealCou'd boast an influence o'er the man you love;O! now exert thy pow'r, assist, direct,And save thy friend from ruin and Matilda.There are, my Lord, who most offend, where mostThey wish to please. Such often is the fateOf thy unhappy friend, when he pours forthHis ardent soul in vows of tend'rest passion;'Tis with such rude and boist'rous violenceAs suits but ill the hero or the lover.SIWARD.I know his weakness, know his follies all,And feel 'em but too well: He loves with transport,
And hates with fury. Warm'd with fierce desire,Or strong resentment, his impetuous soulIs hurried on, 'till reason quits her seat,And passion takes the loosely-flowing rein;Then all is rage, confusion, and despair.And yet,  remov'dThe veil of error, he will weep his faultsWith such a sweet contrition, as wou'd meltThe hardest heart to pity and forgiveness.O! he has virtues that may well attoneFor all his venial rashness, that deserveA sov'reign's love, and claim a nation's praise;Virtues that merit happiness and thee.Why wilt thou thus despise my noble friend?His birth and fortune, with the rank he bearsAmongst the first of England's peers, will raise theeAs far above thy sex, in wealth and pow'r,As now thou art in beauty.MATILDA.O, my Lord!'Tis not the pride, the luxury of life,The splendid robe and glitt'ring gem, that knitsThe lasting bonds of mutual happiness:Where manners differ, where affections jarr,And will not kindly mix together, whereThe sweet harmonious concord of the mindIs wanting, all is misery and woe.SIWARD.By heav'n, thou plead'st thy own and virtue's cause,With such bewitching eloquence, the moreThy heart, alarm'd by diffidence, still urgesAgainst this union with my friend, the moreI wish to see him blest with worth like thine.MATILDA.My Lord, it must not be; for grant him allThe fair perfections you already see,And I cou'd wish to find, there is a barThat must for ever dis-unite us—BornOf Norman race, and from my earliest yearsAttach'd to William's cause; I love my kingAnd wish my country's peace: That king, my Lord,Whom Morcar wishes to dethrone; that peaceWhich he destroys: Had he an angel's form,With all the virtues that adorn his sex,With all the riches fortune can bestow,I wou'd not wed a traitor.SIWARD.Call not his errors by so harsh a name;He has been deeply wrong'd, and souls like his,Must feel the wounds of honour, and resent them,Alas! with thee I weep my country's fate,Nay wish, perhaps, as well to William's cause,And England's peace, as can the loyal daughterOf gallant Ranulph, and wou'd, therefore, joyTo see Matilda lend a gracious earTo Morcar's suit. Thy reconciling charmsMight sooth his troubled soul, might heal the woundsOf bleeding England, and unite us allIn one bright chain of harmony and love,The gallant Edwin too.MATILDA.Ha! what of him?Know'st thou that noble youth?SIWARD.So many yearsHave past since last we met, by diff'rent views,And our unhappy feuds, so long divided,
I shou'd not recollect him; but reportSpeaks loudly of his virtues. He, no doubt,If yet he lives—MATILDA.Yet lives!—Why, what, my Lord?SIWARD.You seem much mov'd.MATILDA.Forgive me, but whene'erThis sad idea rises to my mind,Of brother against brother arm'd, my soulRecoils with horror.SIWARD.'Tis a dreadful thought:Wou'd I cou'd heal that cruel breach! but thenThou might'st do much, the task is left for thee.MATILDA.For me? Alas! it is not in my pow'r.SIWARD.In thine, and thine alone. O think, Matilda!How great thy glory, and how great thy praise,To be the blessed instrument of peace;The band of union 'twixt contending brothers.Thou see'st them now like two descending floods,Whose rapid torrents meeting, half o'erwhelmThe neighb'ring plains: Thy gentle voice might stillThe angry waves, and bid their waters flowIn one united stream, to bless the land.MATILDA.That flatt'ring thought beams comfort on my soul,Amidst my sorrows; bear me witness, heav'n!Cou'd poor Matilda be the happy meansOf reconcilement: Cou'd these eyes behold
The noble youths embracing, and embrac'dIn the firm cords of amity and love.O! it wou'd make me ample recompenceFor all my griefs, nor wou'd I more complain,But rest me in the silent grave, well pleas'dTo think, at last, I had not liv'd in vain.SIWARD.Cherish that virtuous thought, illustrious maid,And let me hope my friend may still be happy.MATILDA.I wish it from my soul: But see, my Lord,Earl Morcar comes this way, with hasty steps,Across the lawn. I must retire: Farewel!You'll not forget my humble suit.SIWARD.O! no,I will do all that loveliest innocenceAnd worth, like thine, deserve. Farewel: Mean timeRemember, Siward's ev'ry wish, the blissOf Morcar, Edwin's life, the public peace,And England's welfare, all depend—on thee.[Exit Matilda.SIWARD. (alone.)There's no alternative but this; my friendMust quit Matilda, or desert the causeWe've rashly promis'd to support—PerhapsThe last were best—both shall be try'd—he comes.Enter MORCAR.MORCAR.O, Siward! was not thatThe fair Matilda, whom you parted from?SIWARD.It was.MORCAR.What says she? the dear, cruel maid!Is she still deaf? inexorable still?SIWARD.You must not think of her.MORCAR.What say'st thou, Siward?Not think of her!SIWARD.No. Root her from thy heart,And gaze no more. I blush to see my friendSo lost to honour: Is it for a man,On whom the fate of England may depend,To quit the dang'rous post, where duty calls,And all the bus'ness of the war, to sighAnd whine in corners for a captive woman?Resume the hero, Morcar, and subdueThis idle passion.MORCAR.Talk not thus of love,The great refiner of the human heart,The source of all that's great, of all that's good;Of joy, of pleasure—If it be a weakness,It is a weakness which the best have felt:I wou'd not wish to be a stranger to it.SIWARD.Let me entreat thee, if thou valuest life,Or fame, or honour, quit Matilda.MORCAR.Yes:I thank you for your council. 'Tis th'advice
Of cold unfeeling wisdom, kindly meantTo make me prudent, and to leave me wretched:But thus it is, that proud exulting healthIs ever ready to prescribe a cureFor pain and sickness which it never knew.SIWARD.There too thou err'st; for I have known its joysAnd sorrows too. In early life I lostThe partner of my soul. E'er since that hourI bade adieu to love, and taught my soulTo offer her devotions at the shrineOf sacred friendship; there my vows are paid:Morcar best knows the idol of my worship.MORCAR.I know and love thee for it: But O! my friend,I cannot force this tyrant from my breast;E'en now I feel her here, she sits enthron'dWithin the foldings of my heart, and heWho tears her thence must draw the life-blood from me.My morning slumbers, and my midnight dreams,Are haunted by Matilda.SIWARD.To be thusThe slave of one that scorns thee, O! 'tis base,Mean, and unworthy of thee.MORCAR.I will bearThat scorn no longer: Thou hast rous'd me, Siward;I will enjoy the glorious prize; she's mine,By right of conquest mine. I will assertA victor's claim, and force her to be happy.SIWARD.That must not be. It ill becomes the manWho takes up arms against a tyrant's pow'r,
T'adopt a tyrant's maxims; force and loveAre terms that never can be reconcil'd.You will not, must not do it.MORCAR.Must not! whoShall dare oppose me?SIWARD.Honour, conscience, love,The sense of shame, your virtue, and your friend.Whilst I have life, or pow'r, I will not seeMatilda wrong'd.MORCAR.You are her champion thenIt seems, her favour'd, happy friend, perhapsHer fond admirer too. I'll-fated Morcar!I see it but too well. I'm lost, abandon'd;Alike betray'd by friendship and by love.I thank you, Sir, you have perform'd your office,And merit your reward.SIWARD.Unkind reproach!Did I for this desert my Sov'reign's cause,My peaceful home, and all its joys, to serveUngrateful Morcar? Why did I rebel?The haughty William never injur'd me.For thee alone I fought, for thee I conquer'd;And, but for thee, long since I had employ'dMy gallant soldiers to a nobler purpose,Than loit'ring thus in idle camp to hearA love-sick tale, and sooth a mad man's phrenzy,MORCAR.You could? Away, and leave me then: With-drawYour boasted aid, and bid Northumbria's sons
Bend to the tyrant's yoke, whilst I aloneDefend the cause of freedom, and my country.Here let us part. Remove your loiterers,And join th'usurper.SIWARD.Mark the diff'rence nowBetwixt blind passion and undaunted friendship:You are impatient of the keen reproof,Because you merit: I can bear it all,Because I've not deserv'd it.Enter an OFFICER.OFFICER.Good my LordsForgive this rough intrusion, but the dangerI trust, will plead my pardon. As I watch'dFrom yonder tow'r, a dusky cloud appear'd,As if from distant troops advancing, soonI saw their armour glitter in the sun;With rapid motion they approach'd; each momentWe must expect them here.SIWARD.Why, let 'em come,Already I have order'd fit disposalOf all our little force. Away, good Osmond,Be silent and be ready.(Exit Officer.Now, my friend,Thou art as welcome to thy Siward's breast,As dear as ever.—When the man I love,Walks in the paths of error, I reprove himWith honest freedom; but when danger comesUpon him, I forget his faults, and fleeWith all a lover's ardour to his rescue;His sorrows and his wants alone remember'd,And all his follies buried in oblivion.MORCAR.Thou hast disarm'd me now. This pierces moreThan all the bitter poison of reproach,Which thou hast pour'd upon me. O! 'twas treasonAgainst the sacred majesty of friendship,To doubt thy honour, or suspect thy virtue.Thou wilt forgive: But when the wounded mindIs torn with passion, ev'ry touch is pain;You should not probe so deeply.SIWARD.'Twas my duty.But come, no more of that. The foe advances.If we succeed, as my prophetic soulForetells we shall—I have some comfort for you—If not, we'll borrow courage from despair,And die like men. Thou stand'st upon the rock.Of danger, and the yawning precipiceOpens before us; I will snatch thee from it,Or leap the gulph, and perish with my friend.The End of the First Act.ACT II.SCENE, a Fortress belonging to MORCAR.EDWIN alone (in chains.)EDWIN.IT is the will of heav'n, and must be done.The hard-fought field is lost, and here I amA pris'ner in my brother's camp: alas!That fortune thus shou'd guide me to a foeWhom most I wish'd to shun! We little thoughtThe troops by Morcar led, had this way bentTheir ill-directed course: but providenceHath so ordain'd, perhaps, to heal the woundsOf civil discord. O! unhappy Edwin,For what art thou reserv'd? No matter what.Since fate depriv'd me of my dear Matilda,Whom I for three long years have sought in vain;Life hath been irksome to me: this, perchance,May end it—For, who knows if nature yetMay live within the conqu'ror's breast, to pleadA brother's pardon Yet he knows me not,But soon he must—Ha! who comes here? Earl Siward!—The second in command, to whom, o'erpower'dBy circling foes, and fainting with my wounds,I yielded up my sword. If fame say true,He bears a mind too great to look with scornOn the oppress'd, or triumph o'er misfortune.
Enter SIWARD.SIWARD.Stranger, whoe'er thou art, be comforted;Thy fate hath thrown thee into noble hands,Who know thy merit. May I ask thy name?EDWIN.I am a poor abandon'd wretch, the sportOf fortune; one whose least affliction isTo be a captive, and from ev'ry eyeWou'd wish to hide the story of my fate:Too soon my name and sorrows will be known.SIWARD.Respect is ever due to misery:I will not urge thee further; all I hope,That gen'rous pity could afford to soothCalamity like thine, by my command,Hath been extended to thee. Here awhileYou must remain a pris'ner, but e'er longI hope to greet thee by a fairer name,And rank thee as our friend.EDWIN.Your genr'ous ordersHave been obey'd, and I acknowledge itWith grateful heart. May I not ask the fateOf him who fought so nobly by my side,That brave old man.SIWARD.The gallant Ranulph—EDWIN.Yes;My fellow captive.SIWARD.He is safe and free.EDWIN.Ha! free! Thank heav'n!SIWARD.The gen'rous Morcar, urg'dBy my entreaties, pardon'd and releas'd him,Tho' much our soldiers murmur'd, and demandedHis life and your's; a sacrifice, they said,Due to the manes of their slaughter'd friends;But mercy has prevail'd.EDWIN.What e'er becomesOf an unhappy wanderer, like me,For your kind treatment of the aged Ranulph,Accept my thanks; it was a precious boon;Morcar may find me not unworthy of it.To day I am his captive, but to-morrowMay see me his deliverer: for knowMy royal master, the victorious William,With eagle swiftness, soon will follow meWith twenty times your force. As this shall proveOr true, or false, so deal with me; rememberI warn'd you of it.SIWARD.And remember thouThat I with joy receive the welcome news:Welcome to me, for I am William's friend.EDWIN.Thou can'st not then be mine, or England's foe:With such a heart as thine, so nobly form'dTo feel for the afflicted, satisfy'd,For thou seem'st, of William's royal right,What cou'd engage thee in this foul revolt,This base rebellion?SIWARD.What but the great bondOf kindred souls, inviolable friendship!The only solid bliss on this side heav'n,That doubles all the joys of human life,And, by dividing, lessens ev'ry woe.EDWIN.Who knows but this day's sad event may proveThe happy means to heal a nation's wounds,And sooth our jarring factions into peace?SIWARD.Had Morcar thought with me, lond since that endHad been obtain'd; but Morcar is—EDWIN.Inexorable.So I have heard, and therefore little hopeTo change his nature. O! cou'd he be wroughtTo sweet oblivion of his wrongs; to buryHis deep resentment: Mine shou'd be the task,A task, heav'n knows, I wou'd with joy perform,To reconcile offended majesty:To soften all his errors, plead his pardon,And give my sov'reign one brave soldier more.SIWARD.When next we meet I trust it shall be so:Mean time, let me prepare him for the change;Retire a while—e'er long we'll send for thee,For ev'ry moment I expect him here:Thy freedom and thy happiness shall beMy first concern, for thou hast well deserv'd it.EDWIN.Farewel. Be quick in your resolves; the time
Requires it; and be wise e'er 'tis too late.[Exit Edwin.SIWARD. (alone)I hope we shall. This well-tim'd victory,If rightly us'd, may smooth our way to peace.Now, Morcar, all thy happiness dependsUpon thyself alone. Now, friendship, raiseThy pow'rful voice, and force him to be happy.He will, he must—he comes—Enter MORCAR.SIWARD.My conqu'ror, welcome!MORCAR.Thrice welcome to my arms, my noble Siward;At length we meet in joy, the day is ours;Thanks to thy friendly aid.SIWARD.We must not boast;'Twas hardly purchas'd, and has cost us dear:You follow'd 'em too close.MORCAR.I own 'twas rash;My youthful ardor urg'd the keen pusuitToo far; and but for thee I had been lost.In war, thy arm protects me, and in peace,Thy councils guide. O! how shall I returnThy goodness? Thou wer't born to save thy friend.SIWARD.Away. I'll not be thank'd. I've done my duty,And if thou think'st thyself indebted for it,Repay me not with flatt'ry, but with love.E'er since my soul with thine, congonial met
In social bands, and mark'd thee for her own,Thy int'rest and thy happiness have beenMy first ambition; and when thou art blestWith all thy soul can wish for, Siward then,And then alone, will have his full reward.MORCAR.O, unexampled faithfulness and truth!But say, my Siward, is our loss so great?SIWARD.The flow'r of half our troops. But 'tis not nowA time to weep, for I have glorious tidings,That much import thy happiness.MORCAR.Ha! what?SIWARD.Know that amongst our captives I have ta'enA noble prize, will make us full amendsFor ev'ry loss—the gallant Ranulph.MORCAR.Ha!Matilda's father! then I'm satisfy'd.The wily chief! by heav'n he shall repay meFor her unkindness: Give him to my rage,To my resentment, to my injur'd love.Where is he, Siward?SIWARD.I have set him free,MORCAR.Ha! free! Thy ill-tim'd metey hath betray'dOur cause. The tyrant wou'd have ransom'd himWith half his kingdom.SIWARD.Still thy rapid passionsO'erpow'r thy reason. What if it shou'd serve
A better purpose; smooth thy paths to bliss,And gain Matilda for thee!MORCAR.O, my friend!My Siward, do not flatter me: By heav'n,Her kind consent wou'd give my ravish'd soulMore true and heart-felt happiness than cou'dA thousand vict'ries o'er the proud usurper.SIWARD.Know then, I gave him liberty and lifeOn these conditions—That he shou'd with-drawHis pow'rs from William's aid, and never moreAssist his cause; the time wou'd come, I told him,That he shou'd know to whom he ow'd the boon,And how he might repay it.MORCAR.That was kind,Indeed, my Siward, that was like a friend.O! thou reviv'st my drooping heart; but tell meDid my Matilda, let me call her mine,Did she acknowledge, did she thank thee for it?SIWARD.O! I assum'd no merit; but to thee,And to thy gen'rous, unexampled loveDid I attribute all. She sigh'd, and wept,Pour'd forth a thousand blessings on thy head—MORCAR.And do'st thou think, my Siward, that one rayOf hope remains?SIWARD.The clouds already vanish,The prospect brightens round thee; haste and seizeThe lucky moment. When the gen'rous mindIs sooth'd by obligation, soon it opens
To the mild dictates of humanity,And softens into sympathy and love.MORCAR.O, Siward! cou'd'st thou teach me but to winThat lovely maid—SIWARD.The task is half perform'dAlready, and my friend shall soon be bless'd.One thing, and one alone, remains to fixHer doubtful heart, if yet a doubt remains.MORCAR.O! name it, Siward; if 'tis in the pow'rOf wealth to purchase, or of victoryIn the fair field of glory to acquire,It shall not long be wanting.SIWARD.It requiresNo price, but such as Morcar well can pay;No vict'ry, but the vict'ry o'er thyself,And thy own passions—Give up thy resentment,Make peace with William, and Matilda's thine.MORCAR.Matilda mine! and must I purchase herAt the dear price of honour? with the lossOf all my soul holds dear, my country's welfare?My word—SIWARD.Away! whilst prudence warrantedOur honest zeal, I was the first to aidThy just revenge; but valour ill-advis'd,And ill-exerted in a hopeless cause,Degen'rate into rashness. You mistakeThe pride of honour, for the pride of virtue.MORCAR.And wou'd'st thou have me bend beneath the yokeOf ignominious slav'ry, quit the causeOf heav'n-born freedom, and betray my friends?SIWARD.I'd have thee just and happy—We have beenSuccessful, let us now be generous,Whilst we have something to bestow; nor wait'Till fickle fortune from our brows shall tearThe blasted wreath, and leave us nought to give.Too long already have we sacrific'dAt proud ambition's altar, to revenge;Now let us offer at the shrine of peace,And sacrifice—MORCAR.To love, and to Matilda;It shall be so—the struggle's past—away,My Siward, haste, and tell her, I obey;Her laws, her king, her master shall be mine;I have no will but her's, and in her eyesWill read my duty—Yet a moment stay,What will my brave companions of the war,My fellow soldiers say? Will they approveThis unexpected change?SIWARD.I know them firmIn their obedience, and resolv'd to actAs you command—But I will see 'em strait,And urge such pow'rful reasons as may bestSecure them to our purpose. Fare thee well.MORCAR.Siward, thy kind anticipating carePrevents my ev'ry wish—But say, my friend,
Where is the gallant chief whom we subdu'd,Who fought so hardly, and so nobly fell?SIWARD.In yonder tent, a wretched pris'ner still,He counts the tedious hours; a heavy gloomSits on his brow, as if some deep-felt sorrowOppress'd his noble mind—We must release him.MORCAR.Thou know'st, my Siward, thrice we had o'erpow'r'dHis troops, and thrice his single valour turn'dThe fortune of the day: Since first I trodThe paths of glory, ne'er did I beholdSuch deeds of valour wrought by mortal hand;I almost envy'd, tho' I conquer'd him.He wore his beaver up, nor cou'd I traceHis features, but he bears a noble form:Know'st thou his quality or name?SIWARD.Not yet;He seems industrious to conceal them bothFrom ev'ry eye.MORCAR.Some deity protects him,As its peculiar care, for as I rais'dMy sword against him, whether the soft passionThat triumphs o'er me, had unmann'd my soul,I know not; but, bereft of all its pow'r,My nerveless arm dropp'd ineffectual down,And let him 'scape me.SIWARD.'Tis most true, I sawAnd wonder'd at it. When you lest the field,With desp'rate rage he rush'd intrepid on,
And seem'd to court his fate, till circling foesCompell'd him to resign, and yield his sword.MORCAR.Away. I burn with ardor to forgive,To free, and to embrace him: fly, my Siward.Let him approach, he cou'd not wish to meetIn happier hour, the master of his fate,For now, methinks, I cou'd be reconcil'dTo ev'ry foe. Away, my Siward, hasteAnd send him to me.SIWARD.Treat him like a friend,He may be useful. Such distinguish'd meritMust have its influence, he commands, no doubt,The royal ear, and may procure such termsAs William may with honour yield, and weWithout a blush accept.[Exit Siward.MORCAR. (alone)Farewel. And nowHow stands the great account? Can I acquitMyself, or shall I be condemn'd beforeThy great tribunal, all-repaying justice?But fair Matilda wipes out ev'ry stain,'Tis she commands me to forgive, and sheMust be obey'd; I'm not the first apostateFrom honour's cause the tyrant love has made.My friend too urg'd the change—(Guards bring in Edwin chained.He's here—Strike offThose ignominious chains—he has deserv'dA better fate.(Guards unchain him.Stranger, who e'er thou art,(turning to Edwin.Thy gallant bearing in th' unequal conflict,For we had twice thy numbers, hath endear'dA soldier to a soldier. Vulgar minds
To their own party, and the narrow limitsOf partial friendship, meanly may confineTheir admiration; but the brave will see,And seeing, praise the virtues of a foe.EDWIN. (aside.)O, pow'rful nature, how thou work'st within me!MORCAR.Still silent! still conceal'd! perchance thou fear'st,Knowing thy rank and name, I might recalMy promis'd pardon; but be confident,For by that sacred honour, which I holdDearer than life, I promise here to free,And to protect thee; did'st thou hide from meMy deadliest foe: Shou'd William's self appearBefore me, he who hath so deeply wrong'd me,So long oppos'd: Nay, shou'd I hear the voiceOf that advent'rous, rash, misguided youth,Whom yet I cannot hate—my cruel brother,I cou'd forgive him.EDWIN. (discovering himself.)Then—behold him here.MORCAR.Edwin! Amazement! By what wond'rous means,Mysterious providence, do'st thou unfoldThy secret purposes? I little thoughtWhen last we met, what heav'n-protected victimEscap'd my sword.EDWIN.With horror I recalThe dreadful circumstance. Throughout the battleI knew, and carefully avoided thee.MORCAR.O, Edwin! how, on this propitious day,Have vict'ry, fame and friendship, fortune, love
And nature, all conspir'd to make me blest!We have been foes too long—Of that no more.My Edwin, welcome! Once more to thy armsReceive a brother.EDWIN.Yet a moment stay:By nature touch'd the same accordant stringThat vibrates on thy heart now beats on mine;But honour, and the duty which I oweThe best of kings, restrains the fond embraceI wish to share, and bids me ask, if yetIn Morcar I behold my sov'reign's foe.If it be so, take back thy proffer'd freedom,Take back my forfeit life: I wou'd not wishTo be indebted for it to—a traitor.MORCAR.Perhaps I may deserve a better name;Perhaps I may be chang'd.EDWIN.I hope thou art;For this I came, for this I yielded to thee,To tell thee William's strength is ev'ry hourIncreasing: if thou mean'st to make thy peace,Now is the crisis—MORCAR.Edwin stop, nor urgeSuch mean unworthy motives as aloneCou'd thwart my purpose. Morcar cannot fear,But Morcar can be gen'rous: for know,Before I saw thee here I had resolv'dTo sheath my sword and be the conqu'ror's friend;For O! there is a cause—EDWIN.Whate'er the cause,Th' effect is glorious. Now thou art again
My brother. Here, let us once more uniteThe long-dissever'd cord.(They embrace.MORCAR.And never moreMay blind resentment, faction, party, rage,Envy, or jealous fear, dissolve the tye!And now, my Edwin, blushing, I confess,Not to thy tender care for Morcar's safety,To friendship's council, or to reason's voice,Owe we this wish'd for change. A female handDirects and wills it.EDWIN.Ha! a woman!MORCAR.Yes,If such I ought to call that form divine,Which triumphs here, who rules my ev'ry thought,My ev'ry action guides. In yonder tentA beauteous captive dwells, who hath enslav'dHer conqu'ror: She demands the sacrifice;She wou'd not give her hand to William's foe,And therefore, only, Morcar is his friend.EDWIN.I cou'd have wish'd that this important changeWere to the hero, not the lover, due.MORCAR.I am above deceit, and own my weakness;But thou shalt see her—Yes, my Edwin, thouShalt bear the welcome tidings to my love.Thy presence will bear witness to the change;Thy freedom, and the joyful news thou bring'stOf our blest union will confirm it to her.Wilt thou, my Edwin—EDWIN.Do not ask me whatI must refuse. I wou'd do much to serveA friend and brother; but a task of joyIll suits a soul oppress'd with griefs like mine.O! I cou'd tell thee—but 'twou'd be unkind,When thou art ent'ring on the paths of bliss,To stop thee with my melancholy tale.MORCAR.What e'er thy griefs, I pity, and hereafterMay find the means to lessen, or remove them;Mean time this tender office may divertThy sorrows; nay, if thou deny'st me, Edwin,I shall not think our union is sincere.EDWIN.Then be it so.MORCAR.I'll send a trusty slaveThat shall conduct thee to her. Soon I meanTo follow thee—away—begone and prosper.But, O, my brother! if thou hast a heartThat is not steel'd with stoic apathyAgainst the magic of all-conqu'ring love,Beware of beauty's pow'r; for she has charmsWou'd melt the frozen breast of hoary age,Or draw the lonely hermit from his cellTo gaze upon her.EDWIN.Know, thy fears are vain;For long, long since, by honor's sacred tyes,United to the lovliest of her sex,Edwin, like Morcar, is to one aloneDevoted, and my heart is fix'd as thine.MORCAR.Then I am blest. Thy sympathetic soul,With warmer feelings, shall express my passion,Wak'd by the fond remembrance of thy own.Go then, thy kind returning friendship prove,Go, plead with all the eloquence of love;And as thou do'st thy brother's anguish tell,Still on thy lips may soft persuasion dwell!Urge my fond suit with energy divine,Nor cease till thou hast made the lovely captive mine.The End of the Second Act.ACT III.SCENE, MATILDA's Tent, with a distant view of the Camp.MATILDA, BERTHA.MATILDA.O, Bertha! I have had such frightful dreams,They harrow'd up my soul.BERTHA.It is the workOf busy fancy in thy troubled mind;Give it no heed.MATILDA.O! it was more, much moreThan fancy ever form'd; 'twas real all;It haunts me still, and ev'ry circumstanceIs now before me; but I'll tell thee all.Scarce had I clos'd my eyes, to seek that restWhich long had been a stranger, when methoughtAlone I wander'd thro' a mazy wood,Beset with thorns and briars on ev'ry side;The mournful image of my wretched state:When, from a winding walk, the beauteous formOf my lov'd Edwin, seem'd to glide across,And ran with haste to meet me: But, behold!A tyger rush'd between, and seiz'd upon him:I shriek'd aloud.BERTHA.'Twas terrible.MATILDA.But markWhat follow'd; for a gleam of light broke in,And sav'd me from despair: When 'cross the gladeA gen'rous lyon, as with pity mov'dAt the unequal conflict, darted forthAnd sprung with vengeance on the spotted beast,Who turn'd with fury on his nat'ral foe,And loos'd my Edwin; he escap'd, and fled:I wak'd in agonies.BERTHA.Be comforted;The dream presages good: Some gen'rous friendShall save him from the perils of the war,And give him to thy longing arms again.MATILDA.O, never, never!Enter an OFFICER.OFFICER.Noble lady, oneFrom William's camp, by Morcar's orders sent,Wou'd crave a minute's conference, and saysHe bears some news that may be welcome.MATILDA.Ha!From William's camp! O, flatt'ring hope! who knowsBut he may bring some tidings of my love!Tidings, perhaps, I may not wish to hear.Perhaps he comes to speak of Edwin's death;Or Edwin's falshood—Be it as it may,I cannot be more wretched than I am.Conduct him hither.[Exit Officer.O, my flutt'ring heart!
Look yonder! how imagination formsWhat most we wish for; see, he comes—It is,It is my Edwin—Save me, Bertha! O!(as he enters she faints.Enter EDWIN.EDWIN.What do I see? Matilda here! she faints!Am I deserted then? abandon'd, lost,Betray'd by her I love? She breathes, she lives!But not for me—for Morcar; for my brother.MATILDA, (to Bertha.)Where is he? O! it was delusion all;The form deceiv'd me. Had it been my love,He wou'd have flown with rapture to me—SeeHe stands far off, and will not look upon me.EDWIN.I dare not.MATILDA.Is it thus we meet again?Is this the kind, the tender, faithful Edwin?EDWIN.Art thou Matilda? Speak; for I am lostIn wild astonishment. It cannot be.In Morcar's camp! Is this the lovely captiveThat I shou'd meet?MATILDA.All-seeing heav'n,Bear witness for me: If, from that sad hourWhen last we parted, this devoted heartHath ever wander'd, ever cast one thought,Or form'd a wish for any bliss but thee,Despise me, Edwin; slight me, cast me offTo infamy and shame.EDWIN.I must, I mustBelieve thee; Yet, 'tis strange—when thou shalt knowFrom whom I came, and what my errand here.Thou wilt not call me cruel or unkind,When I shall tell thee I am come to claimAnother's right, O! heav'n, another's rightTo my Matilda; to request thy handFor Morcar.MATILDA.For thy brother!EDWIN.Yes, ev'n nowWe parted.—Here he told me I should meetA beauteous captive; little did I thinkIt was Matilda, whom he long had woo'd;Whose gen'rous heart, he hop'd, wou'd now acceptA convert made to loyalty by love;She only waited for that blest event,With mutual ardour to return his passion.Can it be thus? Alas! thy presence hereConfirms it but too well.MATILDA.Appearance oft,By strange events and causeless jealousy,Confounds the guilty with the innocent.But sure my Edwin's noble mind disdainsTo cherish low suspicion; 'tis a viceAbhorrent to thy nature, and MatildaWill never practice it on thee. True loveKnows not distrust, or diffidence, but restsOn its own faith secure, and hopes to meetThe truth it merits.EDWIN.Can this be the voiceOf falshood?—Can those lips?—MATIDLA.Mistaken man!Cou'dst thou e'er credit the delusive tale?Cou'dst thou believe I had so soon forgotMy plighted faith? But since I am suspected,Return, and bear this answer back to Morcar.First say, I thank him for the choice he madeOf thee to be the herald of his love:For what is there Matilda can refuse,That Edwin could request?EDWIN.O! that recallsA thousand tender thoughts—MATILDA.Go tell him too,What e'er I rashly promis'd but to gainA few short moments, to preserve my king,And save a father's life, I never meantTo feign a passion which I coud not feel;For I was destin'd to another's arms;To one, who now regardless of his vowsTo poor Matilda, after three long yearsOf cruel absence from her, comes at lastTo doubt her honor, and suspect her love.EDWIN.O! never, never. Sooner will I doubtThe pow'rs of nature, and believe these eyesCan misinterpret ev'ry object here,Than think thee false. O! take me to thy armsAnd bury all my doubts.—Can'st thou forgiveThe jealous warmth of agonizing passion?MATILDA.I can; I must. But say, to what blest chanceAm I indebted for this happy moment?EDWIN.The chance of war. I am a pris'ner here,And but for thee—MATILDA.When I shall tell thee allThat I have suffer'd since we parted lastThou wilt not blame, but pity poor Matilda.Mean while be calm; it is not now a timeFor idle doubts and visionary fearsWhen real dangers threat. I see already,By thy imperfect tale, what miseryMust soon await us, when the fiery EarlShall know this strange event.EDWIN.And wherefore know it?Why not conceal our passion, till some meansOf freedom offer?MATILDA.I abhor the thought.No, Edwin, no. The crisis of our fateApproaches. Never let us stain our lovesWith crooked fraud and base dissimulation.Hark! did'st thou hear a voice in yonder grove?Siward in conf'rence with the haughty Earl;Behold them—see—they part—and Morcar hastes,With quick impatient step, to know his fate.Now summon all thy pow'rs.EDWIN.I am prepar'd.He comes: a few short minutes will determine
Whether Matilda plays the hypocrite,Or is deserving of her Edwin's love.Enter MORCAR.MORCAR.At length I hope Matilda's satisfy'd.Edwin has told thee what a sacrificeMy heart hath made. Ambition, glory, pride,And fierce resentment bend beneath thy pow'r,And yield the palm to all-subduing love.Yes, thou hast conquer'd. I am William's friend;The struggle's past. I have perform'd the taskAssign'd, and come to claim my just reward.MATILDA.By virtuous acts the self-approving mindIs amply paid, nor seeks a recompenceFrom ought beside. You have redeem'd your honor,Turn'd to the paths of duty, and discharg'dThe debt you owe your country, and your king:England and William will be grateful for it.What can you wish for more?MORCAR.There is a prize,More welcome far, beyond what e'er a kingOr kingdom can bestow—thy love—MATILDA.My lord!MORCAR.If to have sav'd thee from the brutal rageOf pitiless ruffians; if to have renounc'dA victor's claim, and be myself the slaveOf her I conquer'd; if to have releas'dMy bitt'rest foe, because ally'd to thee;If, after all my cruel wrongs, t' accept
The proud oppressor's hand, can merit oughtI am not quite unworthy of the boon.MATILDA.The good and just, my lord, demand our praise,And gen'rous deeds will claim the tribute due,The debt of humble gratitude; but love,Love, that must mark the colour of our daysFor good or ill, for happiness or woe,'Tis not the gift of fortune, or of fame,Nor earn'd by merit, nor acquir'd by virtue.All the rich treasures, which, or wealth, or pow'rHave to bestow, can never purchase thatWhich the free heart alone itself must give.MORCAR.Give it with freedom then to him who mostHath study'd to deserve—MATILDA.You talk, my Lord,As if the right of conquest cou'd bestowA right more precious, and a dearer claim;But know, for now 'tis time to throw asideThe veil that long hath hid from Morcar's eyesThe secret of my soul; and say at lastI never can be thine.MORCAR.Ha! Never! O,Recal that word!MATILDA.I must not: Edwin knowsThere is a bar of adamant between,That must for ever part us.MORCAR.Ha! for ever!Distraction! can it be? Take heed, Matilda,
I am not to be mock'd thus. O, my brother!Did'st thou not hear her? But astonishmentHas clos'd thy lips in silence—Never mine!And wherefore not be mine?(turning to Matilda.MATILDA.Because I amAnother's—Well I know our hapless sex,So custom wills, and arbitrary man,Is taught in fearful silence to concealThe honest feelings of a tender heart:Else, wherefore shou'd Matilda blush to ownA virtuous passion for the best of men?MORCAR.A virtuous passion! grant me patience, heav'n!I am betray'd, abandon'd, lost. Another's!Some fawning slave, some Norman plunderer,Rich with the ravish'd spoils of English valour,Hath snar'd her easy heart, and tortur'd mine.But I will drag him from his dark abode;Where e'er he lurks, he shall not 'scape my veng'ance.Thou hear'st her, Edwin.EDWIN.Aye: Who wou'd not wishTo hear the voice of nature, and of love,Thus nobly pleading by the lips of truth?MORCAR.Amazement! Thou art link'd with the vile slaveThat hath unsurp'd my right. All, all conspireTo make me wretched.EDWIN.Why shou'd Morcar thinkThat lovely maid wou'd act beneath herself,And make so mean a choice? Now, on my soul,I doubt not but the object of her love
Hath earn'd the glorious prize, and will be foundDeserving of it.MORCAR.Thou know'st him then?EDWIN.I do;Know him as brave, as noble as thyself:One who wou'd scorn, howe'er the outward actMight seem unworthy of him, to do oughtThat shou'd disgrace his family and name.A man he is of yet untainted honour,Of birth and valour equal to thy own,Though fortune frowns upon him.MORCAR.Now by heav'n,But that I know thy eyes were never blestWith my Matilda's charms, I shou'd suspectThou hadst betray'd the sacred trust repos'dIn thy false heart, by unsuspecting friendship,And wer't thyself the traitor.EDWIN.Think so still.Let fancy, ever busy to tormentThe jealous mind, alarm thee with the thoughtOf seeing him whom thou hast thus revil'd;Stand forth and dare the proof; suppose him hereBefore thee, ready to assert his claim,His prior right to all the joys that loveAnd fair Matilda can bestow: Then lookOn me, and know thy rival in—thy brother.MORCAR.Confusion! horror! misery! O, heav'n!Can'st thou behold such complicated guilt,Such unexampled perfidy, and yet
With hold thy vengeance? Let thy light'nings blastThe base betrayer! O, Matilda! false,Deceitful, cruel woman!MATILDA.'Tis the lotOf unprotected innocence to meetThe cruel censure, which to guilt aloneIs due. I've not deceiv'd, I've not betray'd thee;And wou'd'st thou listen to the artless taleI cou'd unfold—MORCAR.Away! I will not hear,Nor see, nor think of thee. Deceitful villain!Was this thy kind concern for Morcar's safety?Was it for this that subtle Edwin cameA willing captive? Boasted William's strength,And lur'd me no a base, inglorious peace?That, like a midnight ruffian, he might steal,Unseen and unsuspected on my love,And rob me of Matilda.EDWIN.I abhorA thought so mean; the bare suspicion stains,With such foul blot, my honour and my name,I will not deign to answer thee, My birthAlone might prove, to any sense but thine,That I disdain it: 'Tis enough to sayI am Earl Morcar's brother.MORCAR.I disclaimAll ties of nature, or of friendship with thee,And henceforth hold thee as my deadliest foe:As such I will pursue thee, slave, for know
Thou art my pris'ner still—Who waits there? SeizeAnd guard this traitor—(Guards enter and seize on Edwin.MATILDA, (kneeling to Morcar.)O, my lord! if e'erSoft pity touch'd thy breast, if e'er thy heartFelt the warm glow of sympathetic griefFor the unhappy, do not let the rageOf thoughtless passion urge thee to a deed,Of horror, which, too late, thou wilt repent.O, spare a guiltless brother, spare thyselfThe bitter pangs of sad remorse that soonShall harrow up thy soul, when radient truthShall flash conviction on thee. O! forgiveAnd pity—EDWIN.Rise Matilda: 'Tis beneathThe dignity of innocence to kneelBefore proud guilt, and supplicate a tyrant.MATILDA, (rising.)I feel the just reproach—Forgive me, Edwin;Henceforth I never will disgrace thy love,By mean submission. Morcar, if thou hop'stFor future peace, or pardon, set us free.MORCAR.I'll hear no more, convey her to her tent.MATILDA.Edwin, adieu! If honour, virtue, truth,And mutual love, protect the innocent,We yet shall meet in happiness—farewel![Exit Matilda guarded.MORCAR.Let none have entrance there, but faithful Siward.Wou'd he were here, that I might pour my sorrows
Into his friendly bosom! O, Siward!Where art thou?—Ha, he comes!Enter SIWARD.SIWARD.My Lord, the troopsFlush'd with their late success, refuse all termsOf peace with William, and cry out for warAnd vengeance—MORCAR.They shall have it. Now, by heav'n,Thou bring'st me glorious tidings—well, what more?SIWARD.They have discover'd that the noble pris'ner,Who had surrender'd, is thy brother Edwin;This hath alarm'd them; they suspect you bothOf vile collusion, to betray their cause,And yield them to the tyrant. If, they say,You mean them fair, let Edwin be confin'd,And answer for the treason, with his life.MORCAR.And so he shall: They cou'd not ask a boonWhich Morcar wou'd more readily bestow;Already their request is granted.—SeeThe traitor is secur'd. All-seeing heav'n!Thou see'st how justice will o'ertake the wicked!SIWARD.What can this mean? Since last I saw my friend,How the fair day that shone so bright upon us,Is suddenly o'ercast.MORCAR.Alas, my Siward!When thou shalt know—but 'tis enough to sayMatilda's false, and Edwin is—a villain.SIWARD.Amazement! can it be?MORCAR.It is too true;And I am lost for ever. O, Matilda!Deceitful woman!SIWARD.'Tis not now a timeFor idle plaints: Consult your safety: FlyThis moment to the camp—your presence there,And that alone, may quell the rising storm:Leave Edwin to my care.MORCAR.I go, my Siward,Safe in thy friendship; I entrust to theeMy just revenge. Yon moss-grown tow'r that hangsO'er the deep flood—'tis under thy command—Place double guard—he must not 'scape—his fateShall be determin'd soon. What e'er it prove,It cannot be more wretched than my own.[Exit Mor.EDWIN, SIWARD.EDWIN. (pointing to the guards.)Where is my dungeon? My conductors hereWait but your orders; give 'em their commission;For you, it seems, Sir, are to executeThe friendly office: Do it, and be happy.SIWARD.Guards, set your pris'ner free—Thou little know'stOf Siward's soul, to think it jo'ys in oughtThat gives another pain. I've learnt too well,In sad affliction's hard, but wholesome school,The lesson of humanity.EDWIN.O gen'rous Siward, if thou hast a heartTo feel for others mis'ries, pity mine,And poor Matilda's: She has not deserv'dA fate like this.SIWARD.Alas! it rives my soulTo see the tender bonds of amityThus torn asunder by the very means,I fondly thought for ever wou'd unite them;And the fair structure, which my hopes had rais'd,Of love and friendship, in a moment shrunkFrom its weak base, and bury'd all in ruin.If thou can'st prove thy innocence, as yetI hope thou wilt, for in that noble mienI read a conscious pride, that wou'd not stoopTo ought that's base—Still may I hope to healThese bleeding wounds, and sooth him to forgiveness.Mean time be free. Give me thy sacred word,The soldier's oath, thou wilt be found when e'erI call upon thee; and yon tent aloneShall be thy prison; free to range around,Far as my guard extends.EDWIN.Accept my thanks,The humble tribute of a grateful heart;'Tis all I have to give. The time may comeWhen Edwin shall repay thee as he ought.SIWARD.Is there ought more, which honour, and the dutyI owe my friend permits me to bestow,That thou wou'd'st as?EDWIN.O, grant me to beholdThat injur'd maid, to take my last farewel;Then act as fate and Morcar shall determine.I give the pledge of safety thou requir'st,And will be found—speak, wilt thou listen to me?SIWARD.Of that we'll talk hereafter—come—withinI'll hear thy story—Thou but know'st me yetAs Morcar's friend; hereafter thou may'st findI am still more the friend—of truth and virtue.The End of the Third Act.ACT IV.[SCENE, An Apartment belonging to SIWARD, opening to a wood.EDWIN, MATILDA.EDWIN.THANKS to the noble Siward's gen'rous pityFor the distress'd; once more we meet, Matilda,But only meet, alas! to mourn our fate,To feel each others woes, and to be wretched.MATILDA.Eternal blessings wait on him who thusCou'd sweeten sorrow's bitter draught, and makeCaptivity a blessing! O, my Edwin!A few short moments spent with those we love,Is worth an age of common life.EDWIN.With theeIndeed it is; but we are on the vergeOf a dark precipice, and ev'ry stepIs dangerous. If Morcar shou'd return,And find us here together, we are lostFor ever; thou hast seen, and seen with horror,The desp'rate rage of his tumultuous soul,Let us avoid it, let us—MATILDA.What, my love?Thou art my guide, protector, guardian, all
I have to boast on earth. O! teach me whereTo find some blest asylum for my woes,And guide my footsteps to the paths of peace.EDWIN.Let me entreat thee then—MATILDA.O, speak! thou know'stI have no will but thine.EDWIN.Then leave me, leaveThis hated roof: I have a friend within,Who shall conduct thee to the royal campIn safety; bear this signet to the king,He will protect thee, and what ever fateDecrees for me, Matilda may be happy.MATILDA.O! never, never: Safety dwells with thee,And thee alone. Without my faithful Edwin,The peopled city, and the crouded court,Wou'd be a desart to me. No, my love,We will not part: The same benignant pow'rThat led thee hither, that, beyond my hopesBrought my lost Edwin to these arms again,Will still protect that virtue which it loves.EDWIN.Did'st thou not tell me, that this very mornThou had'st determin'd, as the only meansTo shun my brother's love, on sudden flight?MATILDA.But then I shou'd have fled in search of thee.EDWIN.Thou winning softness! how shall I rewardSuch unexampled tenderness and truth!MATILDA.By flying with me. Come, my love, lead on,I'll follow thee to dangers and to death;Nor perils shall affright, nor labours tire,When thou art with me.EDWIN.No: It must not be.MATILDA.Why? What shou'd keep thee here?EDWIN.The ties of honour.MATILDA.And are they stronger than the bonds of love?EDWIN.To Siward's kind indulgence, well thou know'st,I owe this little interval of peace,This transient gleam of happiness with thee;And shou'd I break my sacred word, his lifeMight answer for it; wou'd'st thou have me thusRepay his kindness? No, my love; I mayBe wretched, but I cannot be ungrateful.MATILDA.Must thou return then to that hateful prisonWhen Morcar comes?EDWIN.I must. O! think when IAm pent within a loathsome dungeon, whoShall shelter then thy unprotected virtue?No Edwin there to succour thee: Who knowsWhat brutal lust and pow'r may dare to act,On a deserted, beauteous, friendless woman?Distracting thought! A monarch's vengeance thenWou'd come too late; wou'd make me poor amendsFor my Matilda's violated charms.MATILDA.He cannot be so mean, so base of soul,Or if he shou'd, I have a dagger hereTo save me from dishonour.EDWIN.What! by death?Dreadful alternative! O! hazard notThy precious life, but seize the lucky momentWhich fortune gives us, e'er it be too late.MATILDA.Urge me no more; already I have felt,Too deeply felt, the pangs of absence from thee;Another separation wou'd be worseThan death, and all its terrors. No, my love;We are embark'd on a tumultuous sea,And must abide the fury of the storm.The waves of angry fortune may o'erwhelmBut shall not part us: We will stem the torrent,Brave the proud ocean's rage, and gain the harbourOf peace and happiness—or sink together.EDWIN.Thou hast foretold the tempest, and beholdIt rushes on us.Enter MORCAR and HAROLD.MATILDA.Ha! Earl Morcar here!MORCAR.Harold, I thank thee; thy intelligenceWas but too true.(turning to Edwin.Traitor! who set thee free?They wou'd have 'scap'd my vengeance—false Matilda!'Tis thus I am rewarded for my love,
My ill-tim'd mercy to a thankless brother.Back to thy dungeon, slave. Guards, drag him hence,To prison, and to death.(to the soldiers.EDWIN.Or death, or life,Are equal to me, if I must be tornFrom my Matilda. But, whate'er thy purpose,Be speedy in thy vengeance, nor delayThe cruel work; for know, thy master comes,William approaches—to revenge my cause.MORCAR.But not to save thee.EDWIN.Then farewel, Matilda,Perhaps for ever—If we meet no moreThou wilt remember—But I will not doubtThy honour, or thy love. I know thy truth.Know thou wilt act as best becomes thy fate,Whate'er it be, and worthy of thyself.MATILDA.Of thee, my Edwin, rather say of thee.Yes; I will copy well thy bright example;I'll not disgrace thy love with woman's weakness,But part without a tear. I will but stayTo tell thy tyrant brother how I hate,How I despise him, and then follow thee.MORCAR.I'll hear no more—begone!—away with him.[Exeunt guards with Edwin.For thee, Matilda—MATILDA.What for me remainsI know too well; thy odious love, reproachUnmerited, and threats which I despise.
Thou think'st I have deceiv'd thee—think so still.Enjoy thy error. Thou believ'st us guilty;'Twill make thee happy now—Perchance to findUs innocent, may be thy punishment hereafter.MORCAR.Aye, 'twas a proof of innocence to fly,Thou and thy paramour together.MATILDA.No;I scorn a thought so mean. Cou'd I have leftMy Edwin, long e'er this I might have beenBeyond the reach of tyranny; beyondThy hated pow'r; and safe beneath the wingOf sacred majesty, in William's care.MORCAR.In William's care!MATILDA.Thy conqueror's—for knowThe hero comes—to scatter blessings round him,To heal his country's wounds, chastise rebellion,And punish false perfidious slaves like thee.MORCAR.By heav'ns! she braves my wrath, insults my weakness,And triumphs o'er her slave.MATILDA.There was a time,When with an eye of pity, I beheldThy hopeless love; when I conceal'd my passionFor the dear idol of my heart, becauseI fear'd 'twou'd make thee wretched; but thy rage,Thy cruel treatment of a guiltless brother,Has cancell'd all.MORCAR.Then, mark me: If thou hop'stFor Edwin's freedom, shake off this vile passion;Yield thy proud heart to him who best deserves it,And meet me at the altar—Two hours henceI shall expect thee there—Beyond that timeHe may not live to thank thee for thy bounty.MATILDA.Then let him perish—glut thy tyrant soulWith vengeance: bathe it in a brother's blood,All ruffian, all barbarian, as thou art,Thou can'st not murder his immortal fame:Thou can'st not rob him of Matilda's love.But know—when he, for whom alone this pulseWou'd wish to beat, this lazy blood to flowWithin my veins, when he shall be no more;Another life shall satiate thy revenge;Another victim shall attend thy triumph.MORCAR.Thou talk'st it nobly—'tis the common trick,The affectation of thy sex to boastA fancied firmness, which ye never knew;But with affrighted nature thou wou'd'st shrinkWhen death approaches.MATILDA.Put me to the proof.If thou wou'd'st punish Edwin, know he livesWithin this breast—strike home, and pierce him there.MORCAR.Imperious woman! thou defy'st my pow'r,And let it crush thee. If thy country bleedsIn ev'ry vein; if perjur'd Edwin falls,As soon he shall, a victim to my rage;
Thou art the murd'rer; thou the paricide:I stand absolv'd; the guilt is all thy own.MATILDA.If it be guilt to suffer keen reproach,Pain, persecution, terror, chains and deathFor him I love, rather than stain my soulWith foul disloyalty, I am indeedThe guiltiest of my sex, and well deserveThe pangs I feel.MORCAR.Thou'st driv'n me to the pitOf black despair, and I will drag thee downTo share the dreadful ruin thou hast made.MATILDA.I know thy savage purpose; but remember,The hour approaches when thou shalt repentThis base, unmanly triumph. William comes:Hear that and tremble, thou unnat'ral brother;Nor rocks, nor caves shall hide thee from his vengeance;Inglorious, and unpitied, shalt thou fall,And after ages shall consign thy nameTo endless scorn, and infamy immortal.[Exit Matilda.MORCAR.Inexorable judge! I stand condemn'd,And shall await my doom; but not aloneOr unreveng'd shall Morcar fall—henceforthI bid adieu to love, and all his trainOf fond delusions—Vengeance! I am thine,And thine alone: Thou daughter of despair!Destructive goddess! come, possess my soulWith all thy terrors—Yes; it shall be so.A few short hours are all that niggard fateWill deign to spare me; I'll employ 'em well,For I will croud into the narrow circle
A little age of misery and horror.Ha! Siward here! what brought thee hither?Enter SIWARD.SIWARD.PityFor the distress'd, I knew thou wert unhappy,And came where duty call'd, to pour the balmOf friendship in, and heal thy wounded heart.MORCAR.O, they have pierc'd too deep; ev'n thou, my friend,Thou hast betray'd me: was it not unkindTo set my pris'ner free; to let him meetMatilda, and conspire against my life?SIWARD.Impossible! by heav'n the artful storyHe told, so wrought upon my easy soul,I thought him innocent.MORCAR.Hast thou not heard—SIWARD.From Harold only an imperfect tale,So strange I cou'd not credit it.MORCAR.Alas!'Tis all too true: I am the veriest slave,The meanest wretch that e'er was trampled onBy an imperious woman: O, my friend!My Siward! I have nought on earth but thee:Shou'd'st thou forsake me in this hour of terror!But sure thou wilt not.SIWARD.No: What e'er the willOf wayward fortune may determine for us,Behold me ready to partake thy fate.If we must sue for peace, let Siward bear
The olive for thee: if once more we castThe desp'rate dye of battle, let me perishBy Morcar's side. Come, let us on together;Shake off this load of unavailing sorrow,And seek the field; there, if we fall, we fallWith honor: if we rise, we rise to—glory.MORCAR.Talk not of glory to a wretch like me,Bereft of ev'ry hope. There was a timeWhen that enliv'ning call wou'd have awak'dMy active spirit, and this drooping heartBounded with joy; but my Matilda's lost:Revenge alone—(Enter a messenger to Siward with Letters.SIWARD.From Walstcoff these;'Tis well—retire.[Exit messenger.(Reads)—How's this? then all is lost.He writes me here, that William's fame in arms,Spite of his cruel and oppressive laws,Hath rais'd him friends in ev'ry part: alreadyThe northern rebels are dispers'd, and thousandsFlock to the royal standard. To resistWere madness.MORCAR.And to yield were cowardiceMore shameful—SIWARD.What must we resolve on?MORCAR.Death:The wretches only hope, the wish'd—for endOf ev'ry care, but I wou'd meet him cloath'dIn all his terrors, with his reeking spear,
Dipt in the blood of an ungrateful mistress;And a false happy rival: Then, my Siward,Shalt thou behold me welcome the kind stroke,And smile in agony.SIWARD.Unhappy youth!The storm beats hard upon thee; but our fateWill soon be fixt, for William comes to-morrow.MORCAR.To-morrow! ha! then something must be done,And quickly too. If William comes, he comesTo triumph over us: then, my Siward, whoShall punish Edwin? who—shall wed Matilda?I cannot bear it—If thou lov'st me, Siward;For now I mean to try thy virtue; swearBy all the pow'rs that wait on injur'd honor,What e'er my anxious soul requests of thee,Thou'lt not refuse it.SIWARD.By the hallow'd flameOf sacred friendship, that within this breast,Since the first hour I seal'd thee for my own,With unremitted ardor still hath glow'd,I will not—Speak, my Morcar, here I swearTo aid thy purpose.MORCAR.'Tis enough; and nowCome near and mark me: Thou command'st the tow'rWhere Edwin is confin'd.SIWARD.I do.MORCAR.MethinksIt were an easy task—you understand me—
Justice is flow, and—William comes to-morrow.Thy friendly hand—SIWARD.My lord!—MORCAR.Thou trembl'st—Well another time, my Siward,We'll talk on't—shall we not? Thou mean'st to doAs thou hast promis'd?SIWARD.Certainly.MORCAR.Then speak,And do not trifle with me.SIWARD.Sure my lord,You cannot mean to—MORCAR.Is he not a villain?SIWARD.I fear he may be so.MORCAR.A hypocrite.SIWARD.He hath, perhaps, deceiv'd you, and deserves—MORCAR.To perish.SIWARD.No; to suffer, not to die;Or, if to perish, not by Morcar's hand,Or Siward's—O! 'tis horrible to shedA brother's blood—MORCAR.A rival's.SIWARD.Nature—MORCAR.Love—SIWARD.Humanity—MORCAR.Matilda—SIWARD. (aside.)Gracious heav'n!That passion thus should root up ev'ry senseOf good and evil in the heart of man,And change him to—a Monster.MORCAR.Hence! away,And leave me—From this moment I will herdWith the wild savage in yon leafless desart,Nor trust to friendship—but another hand—SIWARD. (musing.)Ha! that alarms me—then it must be so;And yet how far—MORCAR.You pause.SIWARD.I am resolv'd.MORCAR.On what?SIWARD.To serve, to honour, to—obey you.Edwin shall ne'er disturb thy peace again.MORCAR.O glorious instance of exalted friendship!
My other self, my best, my dear-lov'd Siward—Conscience! thou busy monitor, awayAnd leave me—Siward, when shall it be done?To night, my Siward, shall it not?SIWARD.Or never.MORCAR.Let me but see the proud Matilda weep;Let me but hear the music of her groansAnd sate my soul with vengeance—For the rest'Tis equal all. But tell me, Siward, say,How shall I know the bloody moment? What,Shall be the welcome signal?SIWARD.When thou hear'stThe solemn curfeu sound, concludeThe business done—Farewell. When I returnWith tears of joy thou shalt my zeal commend,And own that Siward was indeed thy friend.The End of the Fourth Act.ACT V.SCENE, A Gothic Hall.MORCAR, HAROLD.MORCAR.TREASON and foul rebellion in my camp!But I was born to be for ever wretched,The sport of fortune. These base mutineers—HAROLD.Your presence on the battlements, my lord,Dispers'd 'em soon; they hang their heads in silence,And all is peace.MORCAR, (to himself.)It is not so within.Wou'd it were done or—HAROLD.What, my Lord?MORCAR.No matter.What urg'd my soldiers to rebel?HAROLD.'Tis thoughtThe gallant captive did by secret meansExcite them to revolt.MORCAR.It must be so.By heav'n thou mak'st me happy with the tidings:His head shall pay the forfeit.HAROLD.Whilst he livesWe are not safe.MORCAR.No more we are, good Harold;'Tis fit he perish, is it not? What say'st thou?HAROLD.Prudence demands his life to save your own.MORCAR.O! thou hast given such comfort to my soul—HAROLD.My Lord—MORCAR.Be watchful: Bring me early noticeOf ev'ry motion: Go.[Exit Harold.Or I must fall,Or Edwin—Hence ye visionary fears;Ye vain chimeras hence—It is no matter:Conscience I heed thee not; 'tis self-defence,Nature's first law, and I must stand acquitted.The prudent Siward seem'd to hesitate,As if he wish'd, but knew not how to shunThe office. He who cou'd behold my tortures,With all that cold tranquility, wou'd ne'erHave ventur'd to remove them. But I've trustedThe sword of vengeance to a safer hand.What ho! Who waits?Enter an OFFICER.That soldier whom thou saw'stIn private conf'rence with me, is he goneAs I directed him?OFFICER.My Lord, even nowI saw him hast'ning tow'rd the tow'r,MORCAR.'Tis well.When he returns conduct him to me—Stay;
If Siward comes this way, I'm not at leisure:I will not see him. (starts.) Hark! did'st thou not hearThe solemn curfeu?OFFICER.No, my Lord.MORCAR.Not hear it!It shocks my soul with horror—Hark! again!Hollow and dreadful! Sure thy facultiesAre all benumb'd.OFFICER.Indeed, I heard it not.MORCARAway, and leave me to myself.[Exit Officer.MethoughtI heard a voice cry—stop—it is thy brother:We lov'd each other well; our early yearsWere spent in mutual happiness together:Matilda was not there—I do rememberOne day, in sportive mood, I rashly plung'dInto the rapid flood, which had well nighO'erwhelm'd me; when the brave, the gallant Edwin,Rush'd in and sav'd me—Shall I, in return,Destroy my kind preserver? Horrid thought!Forbid it heav'n! (pauses.) I am myself again.All pow'rful nature! once more I am thine.He shall not die—Who's there—Enter an OFFICER.My Oswald! fly,Fly to the tow'r this moment, haste and saveMy brother—Some base ruffian—OFFICER.If, my Lord,You mean the noble pris'ner there, I fear
It is too late: This moment as I pass'dThe citadel, I saw a mangled corseDrawn forth by Siward's order—MORCAR.Slave, thou ly'st.Away this moment, bring me better newsOn peril of thy life.[Exit Officer.Who knows but heav'n,In gracious pity, still may interposeAnd save me from the guilt? It is not done;It shall not—must not be—All's quiet yet;I have not heard the signal.(The bell tolls.Hark! he's dead:My brother's dead—O! cover me ye shadesOf everlasting night! Hide, if ye can,A murth'rer from himself. Ha! see he comes:His wounds are bleeding still; his angry eyesGlare full upon me. Speak—what wou'd'st thou have?Matilda shall be thine: He smiles and leaves me—(he pauses and recovers himself.'Twas but the error of my troubled soul.O! guilt, guilt, guilt!(throws himself down.Here will I lay me down,And end my days in bitterness and anguish.Enter SIWARD.Who's there? Ha! Siward here. (rises.)Speak, murth'rer, speak,Where is my brother? Villain, thou hast snar'dMy soul; my honour's stain'd, my fame destroy'd,And my sweet peace of mind is lost for ever.SIWARD.Matilda will restore it.MORCAR.Never, never.The price of blood! No: Cou'd Matilda bring
The vanquish'd world, in dow'ry with her charms,I wou'd not wed her. O! cou'd I recalOne hasty moment, one rash, cruel act—But 'twas thy savage hand that—SIWARD.I receiv'dYour orders: 'Twas my duty to obey them.MORCAR.Where slept thy friendship then? Thou know'st despairAnd madness urg'd me to it—but for thee—Thy callous heart had never felt the pangs,The agonies of disappointed love;Thou did'st not know Matilda—Curs'd obedience!How often has thy insolence oppos'dThy master and thy prince? how often dar'dTo thwart my will, and execute thy own:But when I bade thee do a deed of horror,And shed a brother's blood—thou cou'd'st obey me.SIWARD.Away! this is the trick of self-delusion,The common cant of hypocrites, who railAt others guilt, to mitigate their own?I've been the mean, the servile instrumentOf thy base vengeance; but thou had'st prepar'dAnother, a low ruffian, to performThe bloody office; I detest thee for it,Despise, abhor thee.MORCAR.Thou wert once my friend.SIWARD.Henceforth I am thy foe—Thou hast destroy'dThe best of brothers, and the best of men.MORCAR.Despis'd by Siward—then my cup of sorrow
Is full, indeed—But this shall—(Attempts to kill himself, Siward wrests the sword from him.Ha! disarm'd!But coward guilt is weak as infancy;It was not so before I murder'd Edwin.SIWARD.The murd'rer's punishment shou'd be to live,And shall be thine; thou know'st not half thy guilt,Nor half thy sorrows: I shall rend thy soul.Prepare thee for another deeper wound;And know that Edwin lov'd thee, in his hand,Whilst mine was lifted up for his destruction,I found this paper, 'tis the counterpartOf one he had dispatch'd to William, read itAnd tremble at thy complicated guilt.MORCAR, (taking the paper.)What's here? He pleads my pardon with the king,Ascribes my frantic zeal, in Edgar's cause,To ill-advis'd warmth, and recommendsHis—murderer to mercy: Horrid thought!I am the vilest, most abandon'd slaveThat e'er disgrac'd humanity—O, Siward!If thou hast yet, among the dying embersOf our long friendship, one remaining sparkOf kind compassion for the wretched Morcar,Lend me thy aid to shake off the sad loadOf hated life that presses sore upon me.SIWARD.Tho' thou'rt no longer worthy of my friendship,Deaf to the cries of nature, and the voiceOf holy truth, that wou'd have council'd theeTo better deeds, yet hath my foolish heartSome pity for thee—After crimes, like these,There is but one way left—Say, wilt thou patient waitTill I return?MORCAR.I will.SIWARD.Remember, Morcar,You promis'd me—I have a draught within,Of wondrous pow'r, that in a moment lullsThe tortur'd soul to sweet forgetfulnessOf all its woes: I'll haste and bring it thee,'Twill give thee rest and peace.[Exit Siward.MORCAR.I hope for ever.But where's the lost Matilda? who shall comfortThat dear unhappy maid, whom I have robb'dOf ev'ry bliss. O, save me from the sight,Ye pitying pow'rs!Enter MATILDA.She comes—distraction!MATILDA.O!My Lord, permit—MORCAR.Away—I know thee not.MATILDA.Not know me! 'tis the poor distress'd Matilda,Who comes to ask forgiveness for the rageOf frantic love; the madness of despair,That urg'd me to such wrath and bitternessOf keen reproach; but pardon— (kneels)Gen'rous Morcar,A woman's weakness: Speak and make me blest.Alas! he hears me not.MORCAR.Matilda, rise;I pray thee leave me— (weeps)MATILDA.Gracious heav'n! he weeps;Propitious omen! O, my Lord! those tearsAre the soft marks of sympathizing woe,And seem to say, I shall not plead in vain.MORCAR.Ask what thou wilt, for know, so dear I holdMatilda's happiness, that, here I swearIf all the kingdoms of the peopled earthWere mine to give, I'd lay them at her feet:But much I fear they wou'd not make her happy.MATILDA.Alas! my Lord Matilda's happinessIs center'd all in one dear precious jewel;'Tis in thy keeping—Edwin—MORCAR.What of him?MATILDA.Is innocent.MORCAR.I know it.MATILDA.Just and good;He never meant to injure thee, indeedHe did not.MORCAR.I believe it, for his natureWas ever mild and gentle.MATILDA.Good, my Lord,You mock me.MORCAR.No, Matilda; speak, go on,
And praise him: I cou'd talk to thee for everOf Edwin's virtues—MATILDA.Then thou wou'd'st not hurtHis precious life, thou wou'd'st not—MORCAR.I wou'd giveA thousand worlds to save him.MATILDA.Wou'd'st thou? thenMy pray'rs are heard, thou hast forgiv'n all,And I am happy. Speak, is Edwin free?MORCAR.From ev'ry care—wou'd I were half so blest!MATILDA.What mean you? Ha! thy eyes are fixt with horror,Thy looks are wild. What hast thou done? O! speak.MORCAR.Matilda, if thou com'st for Edwin's life,It is too late—for Edwin is no more.MATILDA.And is my Edwin slain?MORCAR.Aye: Basely murder'd.O! 'twas the vilest, most unnat'ral deedThat ever—MATILDA.Blasted be the cruel handThat dealt the blow! O, may his guilty heartNe'er taste of balmy peace, or sweet repose!MORCAR.But ever, by the vulture conscience, torn;Bleed inward, still unpity'd, till he seekFor refuge in the grave.MATILDA.Nor find it there.MORCAR.'Tis well: Thy curses are accomplish'd all;I feel 'em here within—for know—'twas I.I gave the fatal order, and my friend,My Siward, has too faithfully perform'd it.MATILDA.Siward! impossible! There dwells not thenIn human breast, or truth or virtue—O!Unnat'ral brother!—but I will be calm.MORCAR.Alas! thy fate is happiness to mine;For thou art innocent.MATILDA.And soon, I hopeTo be rewarded for it. O! my Edwin,Matilda soon shall follow thee—thou think'stI am unarm'd, deserted; doom'd like theeTo hated life; but know, I have a friend,A bosom-friend, and prompt, as thine, to enterOn any bloody service I command.(Draws a dagger.MORCAR.Command it then for justice, for revenge,Behold! my bosom rises to the blow;Strike here, and end a wretched murd'rer—MATILDA.No;That were a mercy thou hast not deserv'd;I shall not seek revenge in Morcar's death,In mine thou shalt be wretched—(Attempts to stab herself; Morcar lays hold of the dagger.MORCAR.Stop, Matilda—Stop thy rash hand, the weight of Edwin's bloodSits heavy on my heart. O! do not pierce itWith added guilt.MATILDA.No more, I must be goneTo meet my Edwin, who already chidesMy ling'ring steps, and beckons me awayMORCAR.Yet hear me! O! if penitence and pray'r,If deep contrition, sorrow and remorseCou'd bring him back to thy desiring eyes,O! with what rapture wou'd I yield him nowTo thee, Matilda—bear me witness—Ha! (starts)'Tis he—Look up dear injur'd maid—he comesTo claim my promise.MATILDA.It is, it is my Edwin!(Enter Siward and Edwin: Edwin runs and embraces Matilda.)MORCAR.O unexpected bliss! what gracious hand—SIWARD.Behold the cordial draught I promis'd you!I knew thy noble nature, when the stormOf passion had subsided, wou'd abhorA deed so impious—'Tis the only timeThat Siward ever did deceive his friend.Can'st thou forgive?MORCAR.Forgive thee! O thou artMy guardian angel, sent by gracious heav'nTo save me from perdition. O, my brother!I blush to stand before thee—wilt thou takeFrom thse polluted hands one precious gift?
'Twill make thee full amends for all thy wrongs.Accept her, and be happy.(he joins the hands of Edwin and Matilda, then turning to Siward)That vile slaveWhom I employ'd—SIWARD.I guess'd his horrid purpose,Watch'd ev'ry step, and as the villain aim'dHis ponyard at the guiltless Edwin's breast,Turn'd sudden round, and plung'd it in his own.The bloody corse was dragg'd—MORCAR.I know the rest.O, Siward! from what weight of endless woeHath thy blest hand preserv'd me!EDWIN.O, my Matilda! how shall we repayOur noble benefactor? Much I oweTo gallant Siward, but to Morcar more:Tou gav'st me life, but my kind, gen'rous brotherEnhanc'd the gift, and bless'd me with Matilda.MATILDA, (to Morcar.)Words are too poor to thank thee as I ought;Accept this tribute of a grateful heart,These tears of joy; and, O! may ev'ry curseMy frantic grief for Edwin pour'd upon thee,Be chang'd to dearest blessings on thy head!MORCAR.Alas! thy blessings cannot reach me. GuiltMay plead for pardon, but can never boastA claim to happiness: I only ask
A late forgiveness. If a life of sorrow,And deep remorse, can wash my crimes away,Let 'em be bury'd with me in oblivion,And do not curse the memory of—Morcar.(turning to Edwin.O, Edwin! say, can'st thou forgive the crimeOf frantic love, of madness and despair?EDWIN.As in my latest hour from heav'n I hopeIts kind indulgence for my errors past,Ev'n so, my brother, from my soul I pardonAnd pity thee.MORCAR.Then I shall die in peace.EDWIN.Talk not of death, my brother, thou must liveTo see our happiness complete, to hearMy sweet Matilda pour forth all her heartIn rap'rous thanks to thee, and to thy friend;And grateful Edwin bless thee for thy bounties.MORCAR.It must not be: I know too much already,Of Morcar's weakness, and Matilda's pow'rThey are not to be trusted. No, my Edwin,Morcar shall never interrupt thy joys.Far from thy fight and from the haunts of men,In some deep distant solitude retir'd,To pious sorrow will I dedicateMy short remains of wretched life, and striveTo make my peace with heav'n and wrong'd Matilda.And if perchance in after-times some bard,Struck with the native horrors of my tale,Shou'd bid th' historic muse record it—let him
By my example teach a future age,The dire effects of loose, unbridled rage;Teach thoughtless men their passions to controul,And curb the sallies of th'impetuous soul,Lest they experience worse than Morcar's woe,Nor find a Siward—to prevent the blow.FINIS.PREPARING FOR THE PRESS, A COMPLETE TRANSLATION OF THE WORKS OF LUCIAN, From the GREEK.By THOMAS FRANCKLIN, The TRANSLATOR of SOPHOCLES.SUBSCRIPTIONS to this Work are taken in by T.
