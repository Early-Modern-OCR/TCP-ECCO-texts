ONE OF THE FIRST PATRONS AND SUPPORTERS OF THE HUMANE SOCIETY, THIS SERMON IS INSCRIBEDBY HIS OBEDIENT HUMBLE SERVANT THE AUTHOR.A SERMON.SAMUEL, B. I, C. XX. V. 3. THERE IS BUT A STEP BETWEEN ME AND DEATH.THESE, my brethren, are the words of the afflicted David, which he uttered in the deepest anguish, to his beloved Jonathan. Saul's anger, which he had unwarily though undeservedly incurred, had to the last degree terrified and alarmed him; he knew the power of his adversary, and dreaded, not without reason, the warmth of his resentment.

The danger appear'd so great, and the consequence so unavoidable, that he could not entertain the least hope of safety, but gave himself up to despair: There is but a step, said he, between me and death. His situation indeed, all things considered, seemed extremely desperate; ruin and destruction were immediately before him, and there was scarce a probability of escaping it: but what is there which active benevolence and disinterested friendship will not at tempt, what is there which they cannot perform? Jonathan, whose heart glowed with the tenderest affection for his persecuted and afflicted friend, soon devised the means of unexpected safety, and stepped in between him and death; turned aside the uplifted dart, and restored him to peace, honour, and felicity. The manner in which he acted on this occasion, and the ingenious device which he put in practice to redeem his friend, are described at large in the chapter from whence my text is taken, where the whole interesting tale is told in that pathetic language, and with that artless simplicity,

which so eminently distinguish the sacred writings.Leaving therefore the recollection and perusal, with all those reflections which will naturally occur to you from the consideration of it, to your own leisure and opportunity, I shall proceed immediately to that obvious application of it, which naturally presents itself on the present occasion, and to the original of that excellent and benevolent institution which we are here met to commemorate.The words before us seem to point out and describe the general state of man, and the precarious condition of our frail and transitory being, so aptly compared in scripture to the grass of the field, which springeth up in the morning, and in the evening is cut down, dried up and withered: life is in its nature so uncertain, and even at its utmost extent so short and fleeting, that every one of us might with propriety cry out with David—there is but a step between me and death.
But the exclamation of Jonathan's distressed friend seems peculiarly adapted to the situation of those whose lives are endangered on a sudden by some unforeseen accident or calamity, which from a state of perfect safety and happiness reduces them to that of extreme peril, and from which nothing but a change as unhoped for as unexpected can possibly deliver them: and this, my brethren, is immediately applicable to the objects which the Charity I am here endeavouring to recommend is intended to relieve.Great as the improvements are which in this and other nations have of late years been made in every branch of medical knowledge, yet is the investigation of our own complicated frame still attended with insuperable difficulties: like the rest of the works of God, it mocketh the art of man; we are, as the Psalmist long since observed, so fearfully and wonderfully made, that we know not with any degree of precision where our own existence either begins or ends, and the resemblance

of death is too often mistaken for death itself: the marks are so equivocal as to deceive the nicest judgment, and to mislead the most acute sagacity; hence it hath arisen, as the recommenders of this charity have frequently remarked, that before this excellent institution took place amongst us, many, too many, alas! have paid the debt of nature long before it became due unto her, many are lost in the valley of the shadow of death who might even now have trodden in the chearful paths of life and being.Simple as the process is which we have adopted, plain and obvious as the means are which we have invariably pursued, it cannot indeed but raise our astonishment and wonder that they were not long since embraced, and universally put into practice; but there is perhaps a time appointed by providence for all things that happen in this world, which we can neither anticipate nor retard. In the days of bigotry and superstition an attempt of this nature would have been stiled rash and presumptuous;

in the days of ignorance and indolence it would have been derided as useless and impracticable: even in our own, even in this enlightened aera, it hath been a work of no little toil and labour to confirm and establish it. This child of benevolence, fair and well proportioned as it now appears before you, was frowned on at its birth; it had to combat with the fears of the diffident, the opposition of the selfish, the sneer of the malevolent, and the reproof of the scornful. But, thanks be to the great inspirer of every good word and work! our little bark hath at length stemmed the torrent of prejudice, broke thro' the waves of envy and malice, and is landed safely in the harbour of public approbation. We are surprised at what hath been already done, when we consider how short a space hath been employed in the peformance of it; we look back with astonishment, and forwards with delight and satisfaction.Not five years, my brethren, have elapsed since first we went forth to sow

our seed, and see what noble sheaves we have to boast, and what a plenteous harvest. In this short space, I am authorised to inform this assembly, four hundred and sixty-seven cases have been brought before us—Now, mark, I beseech you, with attention what follows—of these no less than two hundred and seventy have been miraculously successful. More than one half of them. Have we not then, my brethren, fought nobly with the king of terrors? we have diminished his conquests, and abridged his triumphs: we have at least divided the spoils, and more than poised in equal balance the scale of victory.True Charity, like true beauty, to be admired and embraced needs only to be seen and known. It wants no patronage to recommend, no art to emblazon, no eloquence to adorn it. And such is the happy lot of the institution now before you, which hath already met with more success than our most sanguinary hopes could ever have formed an idea of.
The blessing which we have been so fortunate as to confer, is of such a nature that it is not confined to the individual who receives it; many a dependant friend, many a thankful relation, many a happy family croud round, and pour forth their grateful acknowledgments for it.But in cases of this nature argument must ever give way to fact: the tinsel of oratory will avail but little, unless supported by the unerring testimony of experience. To this therefore I would wish to appeal. I would wish to draw your attention towards some of those interesting scenes which this institution hath at various times exhibited and called forth. Permit me to carry you with me but in imagination to one of the most tender and affecting, and which, if you had heen eyewitness of, would never have been forgotten by you. O, for the eloquence of a Demosthenes to describe, or the pencil The little imperfect narrative here given might, I think, furnish matter to some of our eminent artists for an excellent picture; I would therefore recommend it to my friends, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Mr. West, or that ingenious moral painter Mr. Penny, to try their skill upon it. of a Raphael to delineate it!
Suppose yourselves then, my brethren, but for a few moments, in your evening walk of rural retirement, on the borders of a delightful stream, imagine your contemplations interrupted by a strange and uncommon appearance. At a little distance from you behold a busy bustling croud of industrious labourers encircling the body of their hapless companion, whom they have taken, at the hazard of their own lives, out of the neighbouring river, and dragged to the shore without life or motion. Scarce an hour has passed since the object of their grief and attention had left his little circle of domestic happiness in all the glow of youth, health, and vigour. And now behold his body swolln, his eyes closed and sunk, his face pale and livid, his limbs torpid and motionless: without the least signs of life they convey him in hopeless despondency to his own home. The whole afflicted family, summoned

by the dreadful news are gathered together. Fear, despondency, horror, and astonishment are spread over every countenance. On one side behold the aged mother lamenting her lost child, the prop and support of her declining years; on the other stands mute and insensible the afflicted wife, afraid to look up to the horrid spectacle before her; whilst the innocent little ones, happy only in not knowing how much they have lost, look with amazement at the motionless hands which so lately were stretched out to embrace them, and wonder at the silence of him who always so kindly greeted them on his return. Those who would most gladly take upon them the task of restoring him are most unable to perform it; their faculties are all absorbed in grief, their limbs petrified with despair, and all the precious moments which should have been employed in the means of his recovery, are lost in fruitless tears and useless lamentation. They hang over him in silent anguish, take their last farewell in

the agonies of despair, and consign him to the grave.And now, my brethren, observe the change. It chances that one of the sons of humanity, (which is but another name for this institution) is passing by; as soon as he hears of the event, he flies, like the good Samaritan, to the chambers of sorrow, he stops the retreating multitude, the idle sons of curiosity who had assembled but to gaze at and desert him, calls on the most vigorous and active amongst them, to assist him, applies with zeal and alacrity those plain and simple means which reason dictates, as the most proper to reanimate, if possible, the lifeless mass, and pursues them with ceaseless toil and unwearied assiduity. Death, yet unwilling to quit his hold, or relinquish his devoted prey, struggles long and powerfully to detain it: seems to smile, as it were, at the ineffectual labour; till at length subdued by fortitude and perseverance he gives up the contest. Nature, no longer able to resist such repeated solicitatations,

resumes her suspended powers, and exerts her enlivening influence. A ray of hope breaks in upon the gloom, and lights up every countenance. Behold, at last, again he moves, he breathes, he lives. What follows is not within the power of language to describe; imagination alone can suggest to you the delightful scene of wonder and astonishment, of mutual joy, transport and felicity.This, my brethren, is not merely the ideal visionary work of creative fancy, but a real and true, however imperfect representation of what hath not once but often happened since the institution of this benevolent society. Had you, who are here assembled, all been present at it, I hope and believe there is not one of you but on his return from it would most chearfully contribute towards the support of such a charity. Why then should I not also hope that even this faint idea and resemblance of such a scene will strike so forcibly on your minds as to expand them into chearful beneficence?
But this, my brethren, great as it may seem, is not all which we have to urge in favour of this noble charity, we can boast of still greater triumphs, and glory in a yet nobler victory, a triumph over despair, and a victory over sin and satan.If there be a crime that seemeth to preclude all hopes of the divine mercy, it is certainly that of self murther; as it admits not, like all others, either of reparation or repentance; it is indeed the highest and most unpardonable offence against our Almighty Creator, being at the same time an impious distrust of his goodness, and a daring defiance of his power. And yet this horrid practice is become of late years a darling and a fashionable vice amongst us; this pestilence that used to walk in darkness, now stalketh in the noon day.Whether it be owing to that penury and distress which are the inevitable consequence of universal dissipation and extravagance, to the want of true, or the prevalence of false religion amongst us,

to the daring confidence of infidelity, or the equally fatal desponding gloom of methodism,I am informed by a gentleman of fortune and undoubted veracity in the country of L—r, that since the building of two chapels by a pious Lady of Quality, for the reception of the Methodists, there have been repeated instances of self-murther, a crime which was scarce ever heard of or practised in that part of the kingdom, till after the introduction and encouragement of those pernicious people. we cannot possibly determine, but certain it is, that not a year, not a month, scarce a day passeth but we have some melancholy instances and examples of it: how happy then, my brethren, must we esteem ourselves, in being able to trace the steps of our blessed redeemer, and to have contributed towards the saving even a few of our fellow-creatures from everlasting misery! Without our kind and seasonable assistance, they would have rush'd with all their sins into the presence of their judge, and the waters would have gone even over their souls. It may be said, indeed, (and something is

always said by the malevolent and injudicious to lessen the merit of good works) that those who are determined to rush on death, if they are deprived of one method, will only have resource to another; and that we shall not therefore by this institution, much lessen the number of self-destroyers. But surely, my brethren, if we can turn aside but one of the arrows of death, if we can shut up one door to eternal misery and perdition, the trial is worthy of all our pains and all our assiduity. Happy, thrice happy are we to add on this occasion, that not one of those who have been prevented by us from executing their horrid purpose, have from the hour of their deliverance, ever sought for the opportunity of repeating it.But that the facts here alleged may want no proof to establish or confirm, behold the seal of truth here affixed unto them. Behold a A number of the happy objects who had been restored to life, men, women, and children, attended divine service, and were placed in the gallery immediately opposite to the preacher. sight that will plead

more powerfully than all which human eloquence could ever produce. Behold these living testimonies of human benevolence, these speaking monuments of the divine Mercy. Is it in the power of any sensual enjoyment to impart a pleasure equal to that which this glorious spectacle must bestow upon you?What will prejudice and prepossession say to witnesses like these? Send us one from the grave, said Dives to the Patriarch, and we will believe. Behold, ye incredulous, not one but many: what Abraham then refused is now granted unto you. Behold them, my brethren, assembled in the house of God, to return their unfeigned thanks for his unmerited goodness towards them. Shall I not seize the opportunity to speak to and exhort them?To you, then, ye favourites of Providence, ye chosen objects of its gracious

attention, permit me to address myself; permit me to hope that you meet us here with hearts full of gratitude; that ye will not, that ye never can be unmindful of your benefactors; that ye will endeavour to return the obligations conferred on you, by a diligent and punctual discharge of every duty becoming Men and Christians. You are peculiarly indebted to Benevolence; you owe her a richer sacrifice than the rest of mankind, and there is nothing so dear and precious, which you should not offer up unto her: shew therefore, your regard to those who have preserved you by acts of kindness and friendship; not to them, they neither want nor desire it, but to your fellow-creatures in distress; to all those who may fall into the like or any other calamity; be ever ready to fly with zeal and alacrity to rescue them from every danger, and relieve them under every affliction.But above all, my friends, remember that gracious Providence which smiled on our endeavours, and blessed them with

success. Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name be all honour and glory. We are but weak and powerless instruments in the hands and under the guidance of the Almighty Creator, the great fountain of life and being, even the God of your salvation. Except the Lord build the house, their labour is but vain that build it. Except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain. To him, therefore, pour forth all your gratitude; to him give the tribute of praise and adoration. You, my brethren, have been graciously distinguished by him who gave you a second life, and raised you to a double being; there is no way for you to repay the blessing, but by endeavouring, if possible, to deserve it. It becometh all men, but above all men it becometh those who have been thus miraculously preserved to take heed unto their ways, to be cautious and circumspect in every word and in every action. If ye are not the most diligent and faithful, ye must be the basest and most unprofitable of servants; if ye are not the most sober,

chaste, the most thankful, pious and religious, ye are doubtless the most ungrateful and most abandoned of men. This, my brethren, we most seriously and earnestly entreat, this we have an indisputable right to demand of you. Very ungrateful indeed would it be to your benefactors, to spend that life which they have been so fortunate as to restore in the pursuit of vice and folly, in scenes of dissipation, riot, and debauchery. On you it depends, whether we are to consider the continuance of your being as a blessing or a curse unto you, whether we are to rejoice in our success, or with tears of shame and sorrow to repent of it. If your days are but prolonged into guilt, and extended into sin and corruption, if you are given back to life only to offend the great Author of it, it were better that the waves had long since overwhelmed you; it were better, as our Saviour saith, that a mill-stone were hanged about your necks, and that ye were cast into the sea.
Need I add an exhortation to those whom the phrenzy of despair once urged to the commission of a crime which they have since that time, I am satisfyed, so often, so heartily, and sincerely repented of? Those who have learned the value of that treasure which they despised, and know the extent of that blessing which hath been restored to them. Need I call on them to reflect with horror on the dreadful precipice which they have escaped from, need I beseech them to consider, how much is owing to the friendly hand that stepped between them and death, that was kindly stretched out to save them from everlasting perdition?We saw you, my unhappy brethren, deserting from that service to which you had been appointed by the great Captain of your salvation. We stopped, we arrested you in your flight, and brought you back to the post of duty, which ye had ingloriously forsaken: do ye not think it incumbent on you, if you hope for pardon or reward from your Almighty leader,

to maintain it for the future with courage and resolution, to preserve it with honour, to dignify it with more than ordinary zeal, fortitude, and perseverance? alas! how many are there, who at this moment, if they had worlds to bestow, would gladly give them for that seasonable relief, that happier fate which you were so fortunate as to experience! how —Quam vellent aethere in altoNunc & pauperiem & duros perferre labores!VIRGIL AENd. gladly would they now return, if possible, to that penury and sorrow, to all those evils which they fled from, to that door of life which is now shut against them! Think seriously, my brethren, of this your wonderful deliverance; be thankful to the Lord of life for this his gracious preservation of you, and spend the remainder of your days as becometh those who have been thus redeemed of the Lord. This is all which we request of you in return for our endeavours to serve and to restore you. We will not doubt your chearful compliance

with it; your public and voluntary appearance on this occasion pleads strongly with us in your favour, and from your present exemplary behaviour, we draw a propitious omen of your future conduct.And now, my brethren, to you I revert, to you we apply for the further support and encouragement of this noble work. The fabric is raised, but on you we must rely for the support, and preservation of it. We have already received, with the utmost gratitude we acknowledge, much kind assistance from the generous and humane. But, favoured as we have been by the protection of our blessed Lord and Master, we wish still more closely to imitate his conduct, and to follow his divine Example, to go about doing good. There are several parts of this wide commercial kingdom, from their situation peculiarly liable to accidents of this kind, which are at a great distance from the metropolis, and where consequently the ignorance and indolence joined to the poverty and distress of the inhabitants, stand

in more immediate want of all possible incitements to duty and to humanity. To these we would wish to extend our influence; we would gladly expand our circle of benevolence. We would have, in short, such is our ambition, and such our hope, we would have the noble Charity we are here pleading for, embrace and flow round this whole capacious island, even like the ocean that encompasseth it. We would wish, if possible, to make the institution itself still more useful, so to cherish this our little tree of life, as to see Alluding to the use which this Society may be of not only in regard to the immediate object of saving persons apparently drowned, but in varicus other cases, suffocation by the cord, apoplexies, hysteric fits, the effects of sulphurous acids, the steam of acids, &c. in many of which the methods practised by the Society have already been used with success, and we trust may hereafter be of still greater service. new branches spreading from it. Some scyons we have already grafted on it, which have blossomed and borne fruit upon them.
One would naturally suppose that distresses so alarming must awaken the most lethargic; that a call so powerful and so irresistible must be heard even by the deaf ear of listlesness and insensibility; that the heart-felt satisfaction of relieving a fellow creature, of restoring him to life and being, would be a sufficient reward for the exertion of every faculty; but experience, which is ever giving the lye to sanguine expectation, and confuting the shallow reasonings of philosophy, will teach us another lesson, will inform us that we must too often be bribed to our duty, and persuaded even with difficulty to embrace the means of our own best interest and truest happiness. Men may talk largely of the virtue, the disinterestedness, and the dignity of human nature, but it will ever be sound, weak, impotent, and vain. God never designed that this transitory life should be a state of perfection. After all that can be said, and all that can be done, we must take mankind therefore as they are, and not as we would wish them to be. Happy if we can so

guide their affections, so direct their passions and infirmities as to render them productive of the general good, to make the wants and weaknesses of some continue to the welfare and the happiness of others. Add to this, that many of those, whose immediate assistance we frequently stand in need of, are often in such circumstances and situations of life as render them unable to bestow their time and attention without a proper and adequate recompense for it, even though they may in their nature and disposition be ever so willing, tender, and compassionate. From such it would be ungrateful as well as impolitic to withhold it. It must on the other hand be acknowledged, and it is a melancholy truth which we are obliged to subscribe to, that on these pressing occasions, some are often called in to the relief of the unhappy object, who from education, from habit, from example, from we know not what invisible cause, are as unfeeling and insensible as the element that stifled, and the waves that overwhelmed him. Souls thus narrow and contracted,

there is but one way to expand, hearts thus hard and callous, there is but one method to soften and subdue; and that we have prudently and successfully put in practice, whilst at the same time we lament the necessity of it. But the gracious providence of God hath so ordained that out of every evil some good ariseth; one happy effect of that torpor and insensibility which prevaileth amongst the poor, the vulgar, and the illiterate, is the opportunity which it bestows on the rich and affluent to be liberal and beneficent. It secures to you, my brethren, the glorious privilege of contributing, every one of you, as far as your rank and abilities will permit, to one of the most humane and benevolent institutions that was ever supported and encouraged in this kingdom. I doubt not, my friends, but you will chearfully adopt, embrace, and rejoice in it.Let us then, my brethren, if we would see many days, be careful to employ those which God hath given us in acts of mercy,

charity, and benevolence. Who knows but our Almighty creator, loth as it were to interrupt us in the performance of a work so pleasing unto him, when he beholds us thus usefully engaged in restoring and extending the lives of others, may graciously condescend to prolong our own, who knows but at the last and great day these our grateful fellow creatures, whose years we have added to on earth, may plead for us in the courts of Heaven, may intercede with the father of mercies for our pardon and forgiveness! so shall we, who have been kind and benevolent to our distressed brethren here below, be rewarded for it above, so shall the blessing of those that were ready to perish, come upon us.Which GOD of his infinite mercy grant, &c.A LIST OF THE DIRECTORS.MR.

CASES communicated to the SOCIETY in the Year 1777.A Boy, ten Minutes under Water, and recoveredMary Hill, fifteen Minutes and recoveredA Child, five Minutes, and recoveredThe Lives of Six Persons saved by the RewardsMary Rice, restored to LifeLiverpool.R. Alsop, restored to Life by Mr Hinchliffe, BirminghamE. G. after hanging fifteen Minutes, restored to Life by Mr Stebbing, IpswichA Young Woman, restored by a Mr Nicholas, of BathA Young Man, recovered by Mr Aspennal, AbberfordA Man found apparently dead, from being exposed to the Cold all Night, the Body was kept in hot Ashes, and other Means used for upwards of two Hours before any signs of Life appeared.—The Restoration was performed by Dr Garrioch, Old Meldrum, near Aberdeen.The REPORTS for this Year 1777, just published, give a circumstantial Account of the above CASES.The Number of LIVES Preserved and Restored since our first institution, amounts to Two Hundred and Fifteen.One Hundred and Eight Persons have been preserved and restored to Life by the MEDICAL ASSISTANTS of the Society within the last Fifteen Months; so that in Five Years, 467 Accidents have come under the Notice of this charity, and TWO HUNDRED and SEVENTY Persons out of that Number have been snatched from the Grave. The Reports for the Year 1778, are shortly to be published, which will give a circumstantial Account of many very extraordinary Cases of Recovery from Death.The preceding happy instances of Restoration to Life prove, to a Demonstration, the Practicability of recovering those who are to all appearance dead; and ascertain a

very affecting and humiliating Truth;—"that hundreds might have been restored, and have remained to this Moment a Blessing to their Connections, and to the World, if such an Institution had been earlier established in these Kingdoms."The Directors, encouraged by the surprising Success of the Society in its Infancy, propose to exert themselves with double Vigour.It is also intended, as soon as the Fund will permit, to extend the Rewards to a greater Distance, and include every other Instance of sudden Death.N.B. A large Number of Advertisements, containing the Methods of Treatment alone are printed, in order to be dispersed through various Parts of the Kingdom, especially in Sea-Ports, and Towns contiguous to large Rivers, in order to diffuse a knowledge of Means respecting Persons in such critical Situations, and excite the Inhabitants to form similar Institutions.The DIRECTORS have also voted a SILVER MEDAL to the MEDICAL ASSISTANTS, or any other GENTLEMEN, who have been the happy Instruments of Restoration to Life, as an Acknowledgment of their Skill and generous Assiduity.The TREASURER pays the REWARDS of the SOCIETY in the following Manner:FOUR GUINEAS, whenever LIFE has been RESTORED.TWO GUINEAS, in every UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT, provided the MODE of TREATMENT prescribed by the SOCIETY has been used TWO HOURS.ONE GUINEA to PUBLICANS, &c. who receive the Bodies readily into their Houses.To such as are inclined to become Benefactors by Will the following Form of a Legacy is recommended:Item, I give and bequeath unto A. B. and C. D. the Sum of {left blank} to be raised and paid by and out of my personal Estate and Effects, which by Law I may or can charge with the Payment thereof, upon Trust, and to the Intent, that they, or either of them, do pay the same to the Treasurer (for the Time being) of a Charity, called or known by the Name of THE HUMANE SOCIETY, instituted in the Year 1774, which said Sum I desire may be applied towards carrying on the beaevolent Designs of the said Charity.N.B. Giving Land, or Money, or Stock, by Will, to be laid out in the Purchase of any Estate for charitable Uses, will be void by the Statute of Mortmain; but Money, or Stock may be given by Will, without being directed to be laid out.SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR THE HUMANE DESIGN OF RECOVERING PERSONS APPARENTLY DEAD BY DROWNING or SUFFOCATION, &c. are received byJAMES HORSFALL, Esq(Treasurer) Middle Temple,Dr. COGAN, No. 11, Paternoster-Row,Mr. HAWES, Apothecary, Palsgrave-Place, Strand.Where the ADVERTISEMENTS mentioned may be had.FIVE GUINEAS, or more, ONE PAYMENT, constitute a PERPETUAL DIRECTOR.ONE GUINEA per Annum, constitutes an ANNUAL DIRECTOR.THE END.
