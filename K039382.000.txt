MALE-COQUETTE:

Seventeen Hundred Fifty-Seven.(Price One Shilling.)THE
MALE-COQUETTE:
OR,
Seventeen Hundred Fifty-Seven.In TWO ACTS.As it is Performed at the
THEATRE-ROYAL
In DRURY-LANE.—Jacentem lenis in Hostem. VIRG.LONDON:
Printed for P. VAILLANT, facing Southampton-Street,
in the Strand. MDCCLVII.THE following Scenes were written with
no other View than to serve Mr. Woodward
last Year at his Benefit; and to expose a
Set of People, (the Daffodils) whom the Author
thinks more prejudicial to the Community,
than the various Characters of Bucks, Bloods,Flashes and Fribbles, which have by Turns infested
the Town, and been justly ridicul'd upon
the Stage. He expects no Mercy from the Critics:
But the more indulgent Public, perhaps,
will excuse his Endeavours to please them, when
they shall know, that the Performance was
plan'd, written, and acted in less than a Month.PROLOGUE.WRITTEN AND SPOKEN
By Mr. GARRICK.WHY to this Farce this Title given,Of Seventeen Hundred Fifty Seven?Is it a Register of Fashions,Of Follies, Frailties, fav'rite Passions?Or is't design'd to make appear,How happy, good, and wise you were,In this same memorable Year?Sure with our Author Wit was scarce,To croud so many Virtues in a Farce.Perhaps 'tis meant to make you stare,Like Cloths hung out at Country Fair;On which strange Monsters glare and grin,To draw the gaping Bumpkins in.—Tho' 'tis the Genius of the Age,To catch the Eye with Title-Page;Yet here we dare not so abuse ye—We have some Monsters to amuse ye.Ye Slaves to Fashion, Dupes of Chance;Whom Fortune leads her fickle Dance:Who, as the Dice shall smile or frown,Are rich and poor, and up and down;Whose Minds eternal Vigils keep;Who—like Macbeth, have murder'd Sleep!—Each modish Vice this Night shall rise,Like Banquo's Ghost, before your Eyes;
While, conscious you, shall start and roar—Hence, horrid Farce!—we'll see no more!——Ye Ladies, too—Maids, Widows, Wives—Now tremble for your naughty Lives!How will your Hearts go pit-a-pat?—Bless me!—Lord!—what's the Fellow at?—Was Poet e'er so rude before?Why sure the Brute will say no more—Again!—O Gad!—I cannot bear—Here—you Boxkeeper,—call my Chair:Peace, Ladies—'tis a false Alarm—To YOU our Author means no Harm.His Female Failings all are Fictions:To which your Lives are Contradictions.Th' unnatural Fool has drawn a Plan,Where Women like a worthless Man,A Fault ne'er heard of since the World began.This Year he lets you steal away—But if the next you trip or stray;His Muse, he vows, on you shall wait,In Seventeen Hundred Fifty-eight.Dramatis Personae.MEN.Daffodil Mr. Woodward.Tukely Mr. Palmer.Lord Racket Mr. Blakes.Sir William Whister Mr. Burton.Sir Tan-Tivy Mr. Jefferson.Spinner Mr. Walker.Dizzy Mr. Yates.Ruffle Mr. Usher.First Waiter Mr. Ackman.Second Waiter Mr. Atkins.Harry Mr. Clough.WOMEN.Sophia Miss Macklin.Arabella Miss Minors.Mrs. Dotterel Miss Barton.Widow Damply Mrs. Cross.Lady Fanny Pewit Mrs. Bradshaw.THE
MALE-COQUETTE.ACT I.Enter ARABELLA, and SOPHIA in Men's Cloaths.ARABELLA.INDEED, my Dear, you'll repent this
Frolic.SOPHIA.Indeed, my Dear, then it will be the
first Frolic I ever repented in all my
Life. Lookee, Bell, 'tis in vain to
oppose me, for I am resolv'd—the only Way to
find out his Character, is to see him thus, and converse
freely with him. If he is the Wretch he is
reported to be, I shall away with him at once;
and if he is not, he will thank me for the Trial, and
our Union will be the stronger.ARABELLA.I never knew a Woman yet, who had Prudence
enough to turn off a pretty Fellow, because he had
a little more Wickedness than the rest of his Neighbours.SOPHIA.Then I will be the first to set a better Example.
—If I did not think a Man's Character was of some
Consequence, I should not now run such Risques, and
encounter such Difficulties, to be better acquainted
with it.ARABELLA.Ha, Sophy! if you have Love enough to be jealous,
and Jealousy enough to try these Experiments
—don't imagine, tho' you should make terrible
Discoveries, that you can immediately quit your Inclinations,
with your Breeches; and return so very
philosophically to your Petticoats again, ha, ha!—SOPHIA.You may be as merry with my Weaknesses, as
you please, Madam; but I know my own Heart,
and can rely upon it.ARABELLA.We are great Bullies by Nature; but Courage
and Swaggering, are two Things, Cousin.SOPHIA.Since you are as little to be convinc'd, as I am to
be persuaded—your Servant—[Going.ARABELLA.Nay, Sophy—This is unfriendly—if you are resolv'd
upon your Scheme, open to me without Reserve,
and I'll assist you.SOPHIA.Imprimis, then; I confess to you, that I have a
kind of whimsical Attachment to Daffodil; not but
I can see his Vanities, and laugh at 'em.ARABELLA.And like him the better for 'em—SOPHIA.Pshaw! don't plague me, Bell—my other Lover,
the jealous Mr. Tukely—ARABELLA.Who loves you too well to be successful—SOPHIA.And whom I really esteem—ARABELLA.As a good Sort of Man, ha, ha, ha.SOPHIA.Nay, shou'd have lov'd him—ARABELLA.Had not a prettier Fellow stept in between, who
perhaps does not care a Farthing for you—SOPHIA.That's the Question, my Dear—Tukely, I say,
either stung by Jealousy, or unwilling to lose me,
without a Struggle, has intreated me to know more
of his Rival, before I engage too far with him—
Many strange Things he has told me, which have
piqu'd me I must confess, and I am now prepar'd
for the Proof.ARABELLA.You'll certainly be discover'd, and put to Shame.SOPHIA.I have secur'd my Success already.ARABELLA.What do you mean?SOPHIA.I have seen him, convers'd with him, and am to
meet him again to-day, by his own Appointment.ARABELLA.Madness!—it can't be.SOPHIA.But it has been, I tell you—ARABELLA.How? how?—Quickly, quickly, dear Sophy?SOPHIA.When you went to Lady Fanny's last Night, and
left me, as you thought, little dispos'd for a Frolic,
I dress'd me as you see, call'd a Chair, and went to
the King's-Arms—ask'd for my Gentleman, and
was shewn into a Room—he immediately left his
Company, and came to me.ARABELLA.I tremble for you.SOPHIA.I introduc'd myself as an Italian Nobleman, just
arriv'd: Il Marchese di Macaroni—ARABELLA.Ridiculous!—ha, ha.SOPHIA.An Intimate of Sir Charles Vainlove's, who is now
at Rome—I told him my Letters were with my
Baggage, at the Custom-house—He receiv'd me
with all the Openness imaginable, and wou'd have
introduc'd me to his Friends; I begg'd to be excus'd,
but promis'd to attend him to-day, and am
now ready, as you see, to keep my Word.ARABELLA.Astonishing!—and what did you talk about?SOPHIA.Of various Things—Women among the rest; and
tho' I have not absolutely any open Acts of Rebellion
against him, yet, I fear he is a Traytor at Heart
—and then such Vanity!—but I had not Time

to make great Discoveries—It was merely the Prologue—
The Play is to come.ARABELLA.Act your Part well, or we shall hiss you—SOPHIA.Never fear me; you don't know what a mad,
raking, wild young Devil I can be, if I set my Mind
to it, Bell.[Laying hold of her.ARABELLA.You fright me!—you shall positively be no Bedfellow
of mine any longer.SOPHIA.I am resolv'd to ruin my Woman, and kill my
Man, before I get into Petticoats again.ARABELLA.Take Care of a Quarrel tho'—a Rival may be
too rough with you.SOPHIA.No, no, Fighting is not the Vice of these Times;
and as for a little Swaggering—damn it, I can do it as
well as the best of 'em.ARABELLA.Hush, hush! Mr. Tukely is here—SOPHIA.Now for a Trial of Skill; if I deceive him, you'll
allow that half my Business is done.[She walks aside, takes out a Glass, and looks at
the Pictures.Enter TUKELY.TUKELY.Your Servant Miss Bell—I need not ask if
Miss Sophy be at home, for I believe I have seen her
since you did.ARABELLA.Have you, Sir? You seem disconcerted, Mr.
Tukely: Has any Thing happen'd?TUKELY.A Trifle, Madam—but I was born to be trifled
with, and to be made uneasy at Trifles.ARABELLA.Pray, what trifling Affair has disturb'd you thus?SOPHIA.What's the Matter now?[Aside.TUKLY.I met Miss Sophy this Moment in a Hackney Chair,
at the End of the Street: I knew her by the Pink
Negligeè; but upon my crossing the Way to speak
to her, she turn'd her Head away, laugh'd violently,
and drew the Curtain in my Face.SOPHIA.So, so; well said, Jealousy.[Aside.ARABELLA.She was in Haste, I suppose, to get to her Engagement.TUKELY.Yes, yes, Madam; I imagine she had some Engagement
upon her Hands—But sure, Madam, her
great Desire to see her more agreeable Friends, need
not be attended with Contempt and Disregard to
the rest of her Acquaintance.ARABELLA.Indeed, Mr. Tukely, I have so many Caprices,
and Follies of my own, that I can't possibly answer
for my Cousin's too.SOPHIA.Well said, Bell.[Aside.TUKELY.Answer, Miss!—No, Heav'n forbid you should—
for my Part, I have given up all my Hopes as a
Lover, and only, now, feel for her as a Friend—
and indeed as a Friend, a sincere Friend—I can't but
say, that going out in a Hackney Chair, without a
Servant, and endeavouring to conceal herself, is somewhat
incompatible with Miss Sophy's Rank and Reputation
—This I speak as a Friend—not as a
Lover, Miss Bell—pray mind that.ARABELLA.I see it very plainly, Mr. Tukely—and it gives
me great Pleasure, that you can be so indifferent in
your Love, and yet so jealous in your Friendship.TUKELY.You do me Honour, Miss, by your good Opinion.[Walks about, and sees Sophy.Who's that, pray?ARABELLA.A Gentleman who is waiting for Sophy.TUKELY.I think she has Gentlemen waiting for her every
where.SOPHIA.I am afraid, Sir, [coming up to him with her Glass]
you'll excuse me, that notwithstanding your Declaration,
and this Lady's Compliments, there is a little
of the Devil, call'd Jealousy, at the Bottom of all
this Uneasiness.TUKELY.Sir!—SOPHIA.I say, Sir, wear your Cloak as long as you
please, the Hoof will peep out, take my Word
for it.TUKELY.Upon my Word, Sir, you are pleas'd to honour
me with a Familiarity which I neither expected, or
indeed desired, upon so slight an Acquaintance.SOPHIA.I dare swear you did not.[Turns off, and hums a Tune.TUKELY.I don't understand this!ARABELLA:This is beyond Expectation—[Aside.SOPHIA.I presume, Sir, you never was out of England—[Picking her Teeth.TUKELY.I presume, Sir, that you are mistaken—
I never was so foolishly fond of my own Country,
to think that nothing good was to be had out of it;
nor so shamefully ungrateful to it, to prefer the
Vices and Fopperies of every other Nation, to the
peculiar Advantages of my own.SOPHIA.Ha, ha; well said, old England, i'faith—Now,
Madam, if this Gentleman would put this Speech
into a Farce, and properly lard it with Roast Beef,
and Liberty, I wou'd engage the Galleries wou'd
roar and halloo at it for half an Hour together—
Ha, ha, ha.ARABELLA.Now the Storm's coming.[Aside.TUKELY.If you are not engag'd, Sir, we'll adjourn to the
next Tavern, and write this Farce between us.SOPHIA.I fancy, Sir, by the Information of your Face,
that you are more inclin'd to Tragedy, than Comedy—TUKELY.I shall be inclin'd to treat you very ill, if you
don't walk out with me.SOPHIA.I have been treated so very ill already, in the little
Conversation I have had with you, that you must
excuse my walking out for more of it; but if you'll
persuade the Lady to leave the Room, I'll put you
to Death—Damme—[Going up to him.ARABELLA.For Heaven's sake! what's the Matter, Gentlemen?TUKELY.What can I do with this Fellow?SOPHIA.Madam, don't be alarm'd—this Affair will
be very short—I am always expeditious; and will
cut his Throat, without shocking you in the least:
—Come, Sir, [draws] if you won't defend yourself,
I must kick you about the Room.[Advancing.TUKELY.Respect for this Lady, and this House, has curb'd
my Resentment hitherto: But as your Insolence
wou'd take Advantage of my Forbearance, I must
correct it at all Events—[Draws.SOPHIA and ARABELLA.Ha, ha, ha!TUKELY.What is all this?SOPHIA.What, would you set your Courage to a poor,
weak Woman? You are a bold Briton, indeed!—
Ha, ha, ha.TUKELY.What, Sophia?—ARABELLA.Sophia! No, no; she is in a Hackney-Chair, you
know, without a Servant, in her Pink Negligeè—
Ha, ha, ha.—TUKELY.I am astonish'd! and can scarce believe my own
Eyes—What means this Metamorphosis?SOPHIA.'Tis in Obedience to your Commands—Thus
equipp'd, I have got Access to Daffodil, and shall
know whether your Picture of him is drawn by
your Regard for me, or Resentment to him—I
will sound him, from his lowest Note to the Top of his
Compass.TUKELY.Your Spirit transports me—This will be a busy,
and, I hope, a happy Day for me. I have appointed
no less than five Ladies to meet me at the
Widow Damply's; to each of whom, as well as
yourself, the accomplish'd Mr. Daffodil has presented
his Heart; the Value of which I am resolved
to convince 'em of this Night, for the sake of the
whole Sex.SOPHIA.Pooh, pooh! that's the old Story—You are so
prejudic'd.—TUKELY.I am afraid 'tis you who are prejudic'd, Madam;
for if you will believe your own Eyes and Ears—SOPHIA.That I will, I assure you—I shall visit him immediately
—He thinks me in the Country, and to confirm
it, I'll write to him as from thence—But ask
me no more Questions about what I have done, and
what is to be done; for I have not a Moment to
lose; and so, my good Friend Tukely, yours—
My dear Bell, I kiss your Hand— [kisses her Hand]
You are a fine Woman, by Heav'ns! Here, Joseppi,Brunello, Francesi,—where are my Fellows
there? Call me a Chair—Viva l'Amòr, & Libertá—[Exit singing.ARABELLA.Ha, ha; there's a Spirit for you!—Well now,
what do you stare at?—You cou'd not well desire
more—O, fie, fie,—don't sigh, and bite your Fingers;
rouze yourself, Man; set all your Wits to
work; bring this faithless Corydon to Shame, and I'll
be hang'd if the Prize is not yours—If she returns
in Time, I'll bring her to the Widow Damply's—TUKELY.Dear Miss Arabella—ARABELLA.Well, well; make me a fine Speech another
Time. About your Business now—TUKELY.I fly—[Exit TUKELY.ARABELLA.What a Couple of blind Fools has Love made of
this poor Fellow, and my dear Cousin Sophy? Little
do they imagine, with all their wise Discoveries, that
Daffodil is as faithful a Lover, as he is an accomplish'd
Gentleman—I pity these poor deceiv'd Women,
with all my Heart—But how will they stare,
when they find that he has artfully pretended a Regard
for them, the better to conceal his real Passion

for me—They will certainly tear my Eyes out;
and what will Cousin Sophy say to me, when we are
oblig'd to declare our Passion? No Matter what—
'Tis the Fortune of War—And I shall only serve
her, as she and every other Friend wou'd serve me
in the same Situation—A little cheating never is a Sin,At Love or Cards—provided that you win.[Exit ARAB.Daffodil's Lodgings.Enter DAFFODIL and RUFFLE.DAFFODIL.But are you sure, Ruffle, that you deliver'd the
Letter last Night, in the Manner I order'd you?RUFFLE.Exactly, Sir.DAFFODIL.And you are sure that Mr. Dotterel saw you slip
the Note into his Wife's Hand?RUFFLE.I have alarm'd him, and you may be assur'd, that
he is as uneasy as you wou'd wish to have him—But
I shou'd be glad, with your Honour's Leave, to have
a little serious Conversation with you; for my Mind
forebodes much Peril to the Bones of your humble
Servant, and very little Satisfaction to your Honour.DAFFODIL.Thou art a most incomprehensible Blockhead—RUFFLE.No great Scholar, or Wit, indeed—but I can feel
an Oak Sappling, as well as another—Ay, and I
shou'd have felt one last Night, if I had not had the
Heels of all Mr. Dotterel's Family—I had the whole
Pack after me—DAFFODIL.And did not they catch you?RUFFLE.No, thank Heaven—DAFFODIL.You was not kick'd then?RUFFLE.No, Sir.DAFFODIL.Nor can'd?RUFLLE.No, Sir.DAFFODIL.Nor drag'd thro' a Horse-pond?RUFFLE.O, Lord! No, Sir.DAFFODIL.That's unlucky—RUFFLE.Sir!DAFFODIL.You must go again, Ruffle, to Night, perhaps you
may be in better Luck.RUFFLE.If I go again, Sir, may I be can'd, kick'd, and
Horse-ponded for my Pains—I believe I have been
ucky enough to bring an old House over your
Head.DAFFODIL.What d'ye mean?RUFFLE.Mr. Dotterel only hobbled after me, to pay me
 the Postage of your Letter; but being a little out
 Wind, he soon stopt, to curse and swear at me—

I cou'd hear him mutter something of Scoundrel,
and Pimp, and my Master, and Villain—and Blunderbuss,
and Saw-pit; and then he shook his Stick,
and look'd like the Devil!DAFFODIL.Blunderbuss, and Saw-pit! This Business grows a
little serious, and so we will drop it—The Husband
is so old and peevish, and she so young and pressing,
that I'll give it up, Ruffle—The Town talks of us,
and I am satisfied.RUFFLE.Pray Sir, with Submission, for what End do you
write to so many Ladies, and make such a Rout
about 'em; there are now upon the List half a Dozen
Maids, a Leash of Wives, and the Widow Damply.
I know your Honour don't intend Mischief; but
what Pleasure can you have in deceiving them, and
the World? for you are thought a terrible young
Gentleman.DAFFODIL.Why that Pleasure, Booby.RUFFLE.I don't understand it—What do you intend to do
with 'em all? Ruin 'em?DAFFODIL.Not I, faith.RUFFLE.But you'll ruin their Reputations.DAFFODIL.That's their Business—Not mine.RUFFLE.Will you marry any one of 'em?DAFFODIL.O, no; that wou'd be finishing the Game at
once—If I preferr'd one, the Rest wou'd take it

ill; so because I won't be particular, I give 'em
all Hopes, without going a Step further.RUFFLE.Widows can't live upon such slender Diet.DAFFODIL.A true Sportsman has no Pleasure but in the
Chace; the Game is always given to those who have
less Taste, and better Stomachs.RUFFLE.I love to pick a Bit, I must confess—Really, Sir,
I shou'd not care what became of half the Women
you are pleas'd to be merry with—But Miss Sophy,
sure, is a heavenly Creature, and deserves better
Treatment; and to make Love to her Cousin too,
in the same House—that is very cruel.DAFFODIL.But it amuses one—besides they are both fine
Creatures. And how do I know, if I lov'd only
one, but the other might poison herself?RUFFLE.And when they know that you have lov'd 'em
both, they may poison one another—This Affair
will make a great Noise.DAFFODIL.Or I have taken a great Deal of Pains for nothing;
but no more prating, Sirrah; while I read
my Letters, go and ask Harry what Cards and Messages
he has taken in this Morning.RUFFLE.There is no mending him.[Exit RUFFLE.DAFFODIL.[Opens Letters] This is from the Widow Damply
—I know her Scrawl at a Mile's Distance—she
pretends that the Fright of her Husband's Death hurt

her Nerves so, that her Hand has shook ever since—
ha, ha, ha—It has hurt her Spelling too, for here is
Joy with a G; ha! ha! poor Creature. [Reads]
Hum—hum—hum—Well said, Widow; she speaks
plain, faith, and grows urgent—I must get quit
of her—she desires a tête à tête; which, with Widows
who have suffered much for the Loss of their
Husbands, is, as Capt. Bobadil says, a Service of
Danger. So, I am off— [Opens another] What
the Devil have we here? A Bill in Chancery: Oh,
no! my Taylor's Bill—Sum Total 374l. 11s. 5¾d.
—Indeed, Monsieur Chicaneau, this is a damn'd
Bill, and you will be damn'd for making it—therefore,
for the Good of your Soul, Mons. Chicaneau,
you must make another. [tears it] The French know
their Consequence, and use us accordingly. [Opens
another.] This is from Newmarket.— [Reads]—May it please your Honour,I Wou'd not have you think of matching Cherry-Derry
with Gingerbread; he is a terrible Horse,
and very covetous of his Ground—I have chopt
Hurlothrumbo for the Roan Mare, and fifty Pounds.
Sir Roger has taken the Match off your Hands,
which is a good Thing; for the Mare has the
Distemper, and must have forfeited—I flung his
Honour's Groom, tho' he was above an Hour in
the Stable. The Nutmeg Grey, Custard, is match'd
with Alderman. Alderman has a good Wind, and
will be too hard for Custard.—I am, your Honour's
Most obedient Servant,
ROGER WHIP.—Whip's a Genius, and a good Servant. I have
not as yet lost above a Thousand Pounds by my
Horses—But such Luck can't always last.
Enter RUFFLE with Cards.RUFFLE.There's the Morning's Cargo, Sir.[Throws 'em down upon the Table.DAFFODIL.Heigh Day! I can't read 'em in a Month; prithee,
Ruffle, set down my Invitations from the Cards, according
to their Date, and let me see 'em Tomorrow
Morning—So much Reading wou'd distract me.RUFFLE.And yet these are the only Books that Gentlemen
read Now-a-Days.[Aside.Enter a SERVANT.SERVANT.And please your Honour, I forgot to tell you that
there was a Gentleman here last Night—I've forgot
his Name.RUFFLE.Old Mr. Dotterel, perhaps.SERVANT.Old; no, no, he looks younger than his Honour
—I believe he's mad, he can't stand still a Moment;
he first caper'd out of the Chair, and when I told
him your Honour was not at Home, he caper'd into
it again—said he would call again, jabber'd something,
and away he went singing.DAFFODIL.'Tis the Marquis of Macaroni, I saw him at the
King's Arms Yesterday: Admit him when he comes,
Harry.SERVANT.I shall, your Honour—I can neither write or
remember these outlandish Names.[Exit Servant.DAFFODIL.Where is my List of Women, Ruffle, and the
Places of their Abode, that we may strike off some,
and add the new Acquisitions?RUFFLE.What, alter again! I wrote it out fair but this
Morning—There are quicker Successions in your
Honour's List, than the Court-Calendar.DAFFODIL.Strike off Mrs. Dotterel, and the Widow Damply.RUFFLE.They are undone.[Strikes 'em out.Enter SERVANT.SERVANT.A Lady, Mr. Ruffle, in a Chair, must speak with
you.DAFFODIL.Did she ask for me?—See Ruffle, who it is.[Exit RUFFLE.SERVANT.No, your Honour; but she look'd quite flustrated.DAFFODIL.Well, go below, and be careful not to let any old
Gentleman in this Morning—and d'ye hear, if any of
the Neighbours shou'd inquire who the Lady is, you
may say it is a Relation; and be sure smile, do
you hear? when you tell 'em so.SERVANT.I shall, your Honour—He, he, he, I am never
melancholy.[Exit Servant.DAFFODIL.That Fellow's a Character.
Enter RUFFLE.RUFFLE.Sir, it is Mrs. Dotterel; she has had a terrible
Quarrel with her Husband about your Letter, and
has something to say of Consequence to you both—
she must see you, she says.DAFFODIL.I won't see her—Why wou'd you say that
I was at Home—You know I hate to be alone
with 'em, and she's so violent too—Well, well,
shew her up—This is so unlucky—RUFFLE.He hates to see Duns he never intends to pay.[Exit. RUFF.DAFFODIL.What shall I do with her? This is worse than meeting
her Husband with a Blunderbuss in a Saw-pit.Enter Mrs. DOTTEREL, and RUFFLE.DAFFODIL.Dear Mrs. Dotterel, this is so obliging—Ruffle,
don't let a Soul come near me. [Aloud]—And harkee,
don't leave us long together, and let every Body up
that comes.[Aside.RUFFLE.What a Deal of Trouble here is about nothing.[Exit RUFF.Mrs. DOTTEREL.In the Name of Virtue, Mr. Daffodil, I hope you
have not given any private Orders, that may in the
least derogate from that absolute Confidence which
I place in your Honour.DAFFODIL.You may be perfectly easy under this Roof, Madam.
I hope, I am polite enough not to let my Passions,

of any Kind, run too great Lengths in my own
House.Mrs. DOTTEREL.Nothing but absolute Necessity cou'd have made
me take this imprudent Step—I am ready to faint
with my Apprehensions—Heigh ho!—DAFFODIL.Heav'n forbid!—I'll call for some Assistance.[Going to ring.Mrs. DOTTEREL.Let your Bell alone [Stopping him] You'r always
calling for Assisistance, I think—you never give one
Time to come to ones self—Mr. Dotterel has seen
your Letter, and vows Vengeance and Destruction—
Why wou'd you be so violent and imprudent?DAFFODIL.The Devil was in me, Madam; but I repent it
from my Soul; it has cur'd me of being violent.Mrs. DOTTEREL.Come, come, don't take it too deeply neither; I
thought it proper, at all Hazards, to let you know
what had happen'd, and to intreat you, by that Affection
you have sworn to me, to be careful of my
Reputation.DAFFODIL.That I will indeed, Madam; we can't be too
careful.Mrs. DOTTEREL.Well, Mr. Daffodil, I am an unhappy Woman—
married to one I cannot love; and loving one I ought
to shun—It is a terrible Situation, Mr. Daffodil—DAFFODIL.It is indeed, Madam,—I am in a terrible one too
—Wou'd I was well out of it.[Aside.Mrs. DOTTEREL.Do you know, Mr. Daffodil, that if I had not been

very religious, my Passions would have undone me—
But you must give me Time, for nothing but that,
and keeping the best Company, will ever conquer my
Prejudices—DAFFODIL.I should be very ungenerous not to allow you
Time, Madam—three Weeks or a Month, I hope,
will do the Business—Tho', by my Honour, I got the
better of Mine in half the Time—What is Ruffle
doing?[Aside.Mrs. DOTTEREL.He's very cold, methinks; but I'll try him further
—Lookee, Mr. Daffodil, you must curb your Passions,
and keep your Distance—Fire is catching, and
one does not know the Consequences when once it begins
to spread.DAFFODIL.As you say, Madam, Fire is a catching; 'tis dangerous
to play with it; and as I am of the Tinder-Kind,
—as one may say,—we had better,—as you
say—Madam,—change the Subject—Pray did you
ever hear of the Pug-dog that you advertis'd? It
was a very pretty Creature—what was his Name,
Madam?Mrs. DOTTEREL.Daffodil, Sir![Stifling her Passion.DAFFODIL.Madam!Mrs. DOTTEREL.Could I love and esteem any Thing, and not call
it Daffodil?—What a Wretch![Aside.DAFFODIL.You do me Honour, Madam—I don't like her
Looks, I must change the Discourse [Aside.] Upon
my Soul, Mrs. Dotterel, this Struggle is too much
for Man: My Passions are now tearing me to Pieces,
and if you will stay, by Heav'n I will not answer
for the Consequences.Mrs. DOTTEREL.Consequences! What Consequences! Thou
wretched, base, false, worthless Animal!DAFFODIL.You do me Honour.[Bowing.Mrs. DOTTEREL.Canst thou think that I am so blinded by my Passion,
not to see thy treacherous, mean, unmanly
Evasions?—I have long suspected your Infamy, and
having this Proof of it, I cou'd stab your treacherous

or ring your Bell, for, by Heav'ns, I'll—[Catches hold of him.DAFFODIL.I stir! I am never so happy, as when I am in your
Company.Mrs. DOTTEREL.Thou liest: Thou art never so happy as when thou
art deceiving, and betraying our foolish Sex—and
all for what? Why, for the poor Reputation of having
that, which thou hast neither Power nor Spirit
to enjoy.DAFFODIL.Ha! I hear Somebody coming—Now for a Rapure
[Aside.] Talk not of Power or Spirit—Heav'n,
that has made you fair, has made me strong—O! forgive
the Madness which your Beauty has occasion'd.[Throws himself upon his Knees.Enter SERVANT.SERVANT.The Marquis of Macaroons—[Exit Serv.Enter SOPHIA.Mrs. DOTTEREL.Ha! [Screams.] I am betray'd!—[They all stare, and DAFFODIL seemingly astonished.SOPHIA.Mrs. Dotterel, by all that's virtuous— [Aside]
Signor Daffodillo—resto Confuso, tat I am com si
mal-a proposito.DAFFODIL.Dear Marquis, no Excuse I beg—nothing at all—
a Relation of mine—my Sister only—Miss Daffodil,
this is, il Merchese de Macaroni, an Intimate of Sir
Charles Vainlove's—This was lucky [Aside]—Well,
then, my dear Sister, I will wait upon you To-morrow,
and settle the whole Affair. [Aloud] I am the most miserable
of Mortals, and have lost the most precious
Moments of my Life.[Aside to Mrs. DOTT.Mrs. DOTTEREL.You are a Villain—I despise you, and detest
you—and will never see you more.[Exit Mrs. DOTT.DAFFODIL.Ha, ha, ha!—My Sister has a noble Spirit, my
Lord.SOPHIA.Mi dispiace infinamente—it tisplis me, tat I
haf interrumpato, gli Affari of you Famili.DAFFODIL.It is the old Family-business, my Lord; and so
old, that, by my Honour, I am quite tir'd of it.SOPHIA.I hate him already. [Aside.]—Signor Daffodillo,
she is una belissima Sorella in Verità, a very prit' Siss'
intit.DAFFODIL.I must confess to you, my Lord, that my Sister
is a young distress'd Damsel, married to an old Gentleman
of the Neighbourhood, Ha, ha, ha.SOPHIA.O Cara Inghilterra! vat a fortunata Contreé is tis!

te olt Men marri de yong fine Girl, and te yong fine
Girl visite te yong Signors—O, preciosa Libertà!—DAFFODIL.Indeed, my Lord, Men of Fashion here have
some small Privileges; we gather our Roses without
fear of Thorns—Husbands and Brothers don't
deal in Poison and Stilletos, as they do with you.SOPHIA.Il nostro amico, Signor Carlo, has tol me a tousant
Volti, dat you vas de Orlando Innamorato himself.DAFFODIL.But not Furioso, I can assure you, my Lord, Ha,
ha, ha! I am for Variety, and Badinage, without Affection
—Reputation is the great Ornament, and
Ease the great Happiness of Life—To ruin Women
wou'd be troublesome; to trifle and make Love
to 'em amuses one—I use my Women as daintily as
my Tokay; I merely sip of both, but more than
half a Glass palls me.SOPHIA.Il mio proprio Gusto—Tukely is right; he's a Villain.
[Aside]—Signor Daffodillo; Vil you do me de
Favor to give me Stranger, una Introduzione to some
of your Signorine, let vostro amico taste a littel, un
Poco of your dulce Tokay.DAFFODIL.O, Certamente!—I have half a hundred Signorines
at your Service.SOPHIA.Multo obligato, Signor Daffodillo.
Enter SERVANT.SERVANT.Here is a Letter for your Honour.[Surlily.DAFFODIL.What is the Matter with the Fellow?SERVANT.Matter, your Honour!—the Lady that went out
just now, gave me such a Souse on the Ear, as I
made my Bow to her, that I cou'd scarce tell, for a
Minute, whether I had a Head or no.DAFFODIL.Ha! ha!—Poor Fellow!—there's Smart Money
for you. [Gives him Money.]—[Exit Servant.]—Will
your Lordship give me Leave?—SOPHIA.Senza Ceremonie—now for it.[Aside.DAFFODIL. Reads.SIR,I Shall return from the Country next Week,
and shall hope to meet you at Lady Fanny
Pewit's Assembly next Wednesday.I am very much your humble Servant,
SOPHIA SPRIGHTLY.—My Lord Marquis, here is a Letter has started
Game for you already—the most lucky Thought
imaginable.SOPHIA.Cosa é questa—Cosa, é—vat is?DAFFODIL.There are two fine Girls you must know, Cousins,
who live together; this is a Letter from one
of 'em, Sophia is her Name—I have address'd 'em
both, but as Matters become a little serious on their

Side, I must raise a Jealousy between the Friends;
discover to one the Treachery of the other; and so in
the Bustle steal off as quietly as I can.SOPHIA.O! Spiritoso Amico—I can scarce contain myself.[Aside.DAFFODIL.Before the Mine is sprung, I will introduce you
into the Town.SOPHIA.You are great Generalissimo in verità mà. I feel
in miò Core vat de poor infelice Sophia vil feel for de
Loss of Signor Daffadillo.DAFFODIL.Yes, poor Creature; I believe she'll have a Pang
or two—tender indeed! and I believe will be unhappy
for some Time.SOPHIA.What a Monster![Aside.DAFFODIL.You must dine with our Club to-day, where I will
introduce you to more of Sir Charles's Friends, all
Men of Figure and Fashion.SOPHIA.I must primo haf my Lettere, dat your Amici may
be assicurati dat I am no Impostore.DAFFODIL.In the Name of Politeness, my Lord Marquis,
don't mention your Letters again; none but a Justice
of Peace, or a Constable, would ever ask for a Certificate
of a Man's Birth, Parentage, and Education,
Ha, ha, ha!SOPHIA.Viva, viva il Signor Daffodillo! You shall be il mio
Conduttorè in tutte le Partite of Love and Pleasure.DAFFODIL.With all my Heart—You must give me Leave
now, my Lord, to put on my Cloaths—In the
mean Time, if your Lordship will step into my Study
there, if you chuse Music, there is a Guittar, and
some Venetian Ballads; or, if you like reading, there's
Infidelity, and baudy Novels for you—Call Ruffle
there.[Exit DAFF.SOPHIA.[Looking after him] I am shock'd at him—He is
really more abandon'd than Tukely's Jealousy describ'd
him—I have got my Proofs, and will not venture
any further; I am vex'd that I shou'd be angry at
him, when I shou'd only despise him—But I am so
angry, that I cou'd almost wish myself a Man, that
my Breeches might demand Satisfaction for the Injury
he has done my Petticoats.—Exit.End of the FIRST ACT.ACT II.SCENE, Mrs. DAMPLY'S Lodgings.Enter ARABELLA and SOPHIA.SOPHIA.IN short, his own Declarations, the unexpected
Meeting of Mrs. Dotterel, his Usage of my Letter,
and twenty Things beside, determin'd me not to
go among the Set of 'em—So making the best Excuse
I cou'd, I got quit of him and his Companions.ARABELLA.All this may be true, Sophy—Every young Fellow
has his Vanities; Fashion has made such Irregularities
Accomplishments, and the Man may be worth
having, for all your Discoveries.SOPHIA.What! an abandon'd, rash, profligate Male-Coquette;
a Wretch, who can assume Passions he never
feels, and sport with our Sex's Frailties—Fie, fie,
Bell.ARABELLA.Well, well, you are too angry to be merciful—
If he is such a Monster, I am glad you are out of
his Clutches, and that you can so easily resign him
to another.SOPHIA.To another! there is not that Woman, be she ever
so handsome, that I hate enough, to wish her so much

Evil; and happy it is for you, Bell, that you have a
Heart to resist his Allurements.ARABELLA.Yes, I thank my Stars—I am not so susceptible
of Impressions of that Kind—and yet—I won't
swear—if an agreeable Man—I—I—SOPHIA.No, no, Bell, you are not absolute Stone—you
you may be mollified—She is confounded—[Aside.ARABELLA.Surely he has not betray'd me—'Tis impossible,
I cannot be deceiv'd.[Aside.SOPHIA.Well, shall we go in to the Ladies and Mr. Tukely?
Were they not surpriz'd when he open'd the Business
to 'em?ARABELLA.'Twas the finest Scene imaginable—You cou'd see,
tho' they all endeavour'd to hide their Liking to
Daffodil, all were uneasy at Tukely's Discovery. At
first, they objected to his Scheme; but they began to
listen to his Proposal the Moment I was call'd out
to you; what farther he intends, is a Secret to us all;
but here he comes, and without the Ladies.[Enter TUKELY:TUKELY.Pray, Miss Bell—Bless me! Miss Sophy return'd!
I dare not ask—and yet if my Eyes do not flatter my
Heart—your Looks—SOPHIA.Don't rely too much upon Looks, Mr. Tukely.TUKELY.Madam—why sure—SOPHIA.Don't imagine, I say, that you can always see the
Mind in the Face.TUKELY.I can see, Madam, that your Mind is not dispos'd
to wish, or make me happy.SOPHIA.Did not I bid you not to rely upon Looks; for do
you know now that my Mind is at this Time most
absolutely dispos'd—to do every thing that you wou'd
have me.[Curtsys.TUKELY.Then I have nothing more to wish or ask of Fortune.[Kneels, and kisses her Hand.ARABELLA.Come, come, this is no Time to attend to one,
when you have so many Ladies to take Care of.TUKELY.I will not yet enquire into your Adventures, 'till I
have accomplish'd my own. The Ladies within have
at last agreed, to attend me this Evening; where, if
you have a Mind to finish the Picture you have begun
this Morning, an Opportunity may offer.SOPHIA.I am contented with my Sketch—However, I'll
make one; and if you have an Occasion for a Second
in any thing—I am your Man—command me.TUKELY.A Match—from this Moment I take you as my
Second; nay, my First in every Circumstance of our
future Lives.ARABELLA.Mighty pretty, truly!—and so I am to stand cooling
my Heels here, while you are making yourselves
ridiculous.SOPHIA:Bell's in the Right—to Business, to Business—
Mr. Tukeley, you must introduce me to the Ladies;
I can at least make as good a Figure as Mr. Daffodil
among 'em.[Exit Sophia and Tukely.ARABELLA.When Daffodil's real Inclinations are known, how
those poor Wretches will be disappointed.[Exit Arab.SCENE, The Club-Room.Lord RACKET, Sir TAN-TIVY, Sir WILLIAM

Cloaths, and SOPHIA in Mens.Ladies ALL.Ha, ha, ha.ARABELLA.What a Figure! And what a Scheme.TUKELY.Dear Ladies, be as merry with my Figure as you
please—Yet you shall see, this Figure, awkward
as it is, shall be preferr'd in its Turn, as well as you
have been.SOPHIA.Why will you give yourself this unnecessary
Trouble, Mr. Tukely, to convince these Ladies, who
had rather still be deluded, and will hate your
Friendship for breaking the Charm.ARABELLA.My dear Cousin, tho' you are satisfied, these Ladies
are not; and if they have their particular Reasons
for their Infidelity; pray, let 'em enjoy it, 'till
they have other Proofs than your Prejudices.SOPHIA.Ay, Bell, we have all our Prejudices.TUKELY.What signifies reasoning, when we are going upon
the Experiment? Dispose of yourselves behind
those Trees, and I will repair to the Place of Appointment,
and draw him hither; but you promise
to contain yourselves, let what will happen. Hear,
and see; but be silent.—[Exit TUKELY.SOPHIA.A severe Injunction, indeed, Ladies—But I must
to my Post.[Exit. SOP.Widow DAMPLY.If he's a Villain, I can never hold!Lady PEWIT.I shall tear his Eyes out.Mrs. DOTTEREL.For my Part, if I was unmarried, I should not
think him worth my Anger.ARABELLA.But as you are, Madam—Mrs. DOTTEREL.I understand your Insinuations, Miss Bell; but my
Character and Conduct need no Justification.ARABELLA.I beg Pardon, Madam; I intended no Offence.—
But haste to your Posts, Ladies; the Enemy's at
Hand.[They retire behind the Trees.Enter TUKELY and DAFFODIL.TUKELY.In a Woman's Voice.] For Heaven's Sake, let 
be cautious—I am sure I heard a Noise.DAFFODIL.'Twas nothing but your Fear, my Angel!—
don't be alarm'd—There can be no Danger,
while we have Love and Darkness to befriend us.TUKELY.Bless me, how my Heart beats!DAFFODIL.Poor Soul! what a Fright it is in!—You must
not give Way to these Alarms—Were you as
well convinc'd of my Honour, as I am of your
Charms, you wou'd have nothing to fear—[Squeezes her Hand.ARABELLA.Upon my Word!—[Aside.Widow DAMPLY.So, so, so.[Aside.TUKELY.Hold, Sir, you must take no Liberties—But,
if you have the least Feeling for an unhappy Woman,
urg'd by her Passion to this imprudent Step,
assist me—forgive me—let me go.DAFFODIL.Can you doubt my Honour? Can you doubt my
Love? What Assurances can I give you to abate
your Fears?Mrs. DOTTEREL.Very slender Ones, I can assure her.[Aside.TUKELY.I deserve to suffer all I feel—For what, but
the most blinded Passion, cou'd induce me to declare
myself to one, whose Amours and Infidelities are
the common Topic of Conversation.DAFFODIL.Flattering Creature! [Aside.]—May I never
know your dear Name, see your charming Face,
touch your soft Hand, or hear your sweet Voice,
if I am not more sincere in my Affection for this
little Finger, than for all the Sex besides.[The Ladies seem astonish'd.TUKELY.Except the Widow Damply—DAFFODIL.She!—Do you know her, Madam;TUKELY.I have not that Honour—DAFFODIL.I thought so—Did you never see her, Madam, nodling
and gogling in her Old-fashion'd heavy Chariot,
drawn by a pair of lean hackney Horses, with a fat
Blackamoor Footman behind, in a scanty Livery,
Red greasy Stockings, and a dirty Turban?[The Widow seems disorder'd.TUKELY.All which may be only a Foil to her Beauty.[Sighs.DAFFODIL.Beauty! Don't sigh, Madam; she is past Forty,
wears a Wig, and has lost two of her fore Teeth.
—And then, she has so long a Beard upon her
upper Lip, and takes so much Spanish Snuff, that
she looks, for all the World, like the Great Mogul
in Petticoats; ha, ha,—Widow DAMPLY.What Falshood and Ingratitude![Aside.TUKELY.Cou'd I descend to the Slander of the Town,
there is a married Lady—DAFFODIL.Poor Mrs. Dotterel, you mean—Mrs. DOTTEREL.Why am I to be mentioned!—I have nothing
to do—Widow DAMPLY.Nay, nay; you must have your Share of the Panegyrick.TUKELY.She is young, and has Wit.DAFFODIL.She's an Ideot, Madam; and as Fools are generally
loving, she has forgot all her Obligations to
old Mr. Dotterel, who married her without a Petticoat;
and now seizes upon every young Fellow she
can lay her Hands upon; she has spoil'd me three
Suits of Cloaths, with tearing the Flaps and Sleeves.
—Ha, ha, ha.Mrs. DOTTEREL.Monster of Iniquity!—DAFFODIL.She has even storm'd me in my own House; but
with all my Faults, Madam, you'll never find me
over-fond of Age, or Ignorance.Widow DAMPLY.I cou'd tear him to Pieces.—Mrs. DOTTEREL.I will tear him to Pieces.ARABELLA.Be quiet—and we'll all tear him to Pieces.TUKELY.He has swallow'd the Hook, and can't escape.[Aside.DAFFODIL.What do you say, Madam?TUKELY.I am only sighing, Sir.DAFFODIL.Fond Creature! [Aside.] I know there are a thousand
Stories about me: You have heard too of
Lady Fanny Pewit, I suppose? Don't be alarm'd.TUKELY.I can't help it, Sir. She is a fine Woman, and
Woman of Quality.DAFFODIL.A fine Woman, perhaps, for a Woman of Quality
—but she is an absolute old Maid, Madam, almost
as thick as she is long—middle-aged, homely
and wanton! That's her Character.Lady PEWIT.Then there is no Sincerity in Man.[Going.ARABELLA.Positively, you shan't stir.DAFFODIL.Upon my Soul, I pity the poor Creature!—
She is now upon her last Legs.—If she does not
run away with some foolish Gentleman this Winter
—She'll return into the Country, and marry
her Footman.—Ha, ha, ha.Lady PEWIT.My Footman shall break his Bones, I can tell
him that.DAFFODIL.Hush, Madam! I protest, I thought I heard a
Voice—I wonder they don't come.[Aside.TUKELY.'Twas only I, Mr. Daffodil—I was murmuring to
you.[Sighs.DAFFODIL.Pretty Murmurer!—Egad, if they don't
come soon, the Lady will grow fond.[Aside.TUKELY.But among your Conquests, Mr. Daffodil, you
forget Miss Sophy Sprightly.DAFFODIL.And her Cousin Arabella.—I was coming to
'em; poor, silly, good-natur'd, loving Fools;—
I made my Addresses to one thro' Pique, and the
other for Pity—That was all.TUKELY.O, that I could believe you.DAFFODIL.Don't be uneasy, I'll tell you how it was, Madam
—You must know, there is a silly, self-sufficient
Fellow, one Tukely—TUKELY.So, so, [Aside.] I know him a little.DAFFODIL.I am sorry for it—The less you know of him
the better; the Fellow pretended to look fierce at
me, for which I resolv'd to have his Mistress: So
I threw in my Line, and without much Trouble,
hook'd her. Her poor Cousin too, nibbled at the
Bait, and was caught.—So I have had my Revenge
upon Tukely, and now I shall willingly resign
poor Sophy, and throw him in her Cousin, for a Make-Weight.
—Ha, ha, ha!Lady PEWIT.This is some Comfort at least.ARABELLA.Your Ladyship is better than you was.[Noise without.TUKELY.I vow I hear a Noise.—What shall we do? It
comes this Way.DAFFODIL.They can't see us, my Dear.—I wish my Friends
would come. [Aside.] Don't whisper or breath.Enter SOPHIA, in a Surtout, and slouch'd Hat.SOPHIA.If I cou'd but catch her at her Pranks—she
certainly must be this Way—for the Chair is

waiting at the End of Rosamond's Pond—I have
thrown one of her Chairmen into it—and if I
cou'd but catch her—TUKELY.O, Sir! My Passion has undone me—I am discover'd;
it is my Husband, Sir George, and he is
looking for me—DAFFODIL.The Devil it is! Why then, Madam, the best
Way will be for you to go to him—and let me
sneak off the other Way.TUKELY.Go to him, Sir! What can I say to him?DAFFODIL.Any Thing, Madam—say you had the Vapours,
and wanted Air.TUKELY.Lord, Sir!—he is the most passionate of Mortals;
and I am afraid is in Liquor too—and then he
is mad.SOPHIA.If I cou'd but catch her—[Looking about.DAFFODIL.For your Sake, Madam, I'll make the best of my
Way Home—[Going.TUKELY.What! wou'd you leave me to the Fury of an
enrag'd Husband!—Is that your Affection.[Holds him.SOPHIA.If I cou'd but catch her—Ha! what's that? I saw
something move in the Dark—the Point of my
Sword shall tickle it out, whatever it is.[Draws, and goes towards 'em.TUKELY.For Heaven's Sake draw, and fight him, while I
make my Escape.DAFFODIL.Fight him!—'twou'd be cowardly to fight in
the Dark, and with a drunken Man—I'll call the
Sentery.TUKELY.And expose us to the World?DAFFODIL.I wou'd to Heav'n we were [Aside]—[He comes forward.]
Let me go, Madam, you pinch me to the Bone.TUKELY.He won't know us—I have my Masque on.LADIES.Ha! ha! ha!SOPHIA.What, is the Devil and his Imps playing at Blindman's
Buff?—Ay, ay, here he is, indeed—Satan
himself, dress'd like a fine Gentleman—Come, Mr.
Devil, out with your Pitch-fork, and let us take a
Thrust or two.DAFFODIL.You mistake me, Sir, I am not the Person—
indeed, I am not—I know nothing of your Wife,
Sir George—and if you know how little I care for
the whole Sex, you wou'd not be so furious with an
innocent Man.SOPHIA.Who are you then?—And what are you doing
with that Blackamoor Lady there—dancing a Saraband
with a Pair of Castanets? Speak, Sir!DAFFODIL.Pray forbear, Sir; here's Company coming that
will satisfie you in every Thing—Hallo, hallo—

Here, here, here; [Hallo's faintly] my Lord, my
my Lord—Spinner, Dizzy—Hallo!Enter Lord RACKET, Sir TAN-TIVY, SPINNER,
and DIZZY, with Torches.Lord RACKET.What's the Matter here?—Who calls for Help?DAFFODIL.[Running to 'em with his Sword drawn] O, my
Friends, I have been wishing for you this half Hour.
I have been set upon by a dozen Fellows—They
have all made their Escape, but this—My Arm is
quite dead—I have been at Cart and Tierce with
'em all, for near a Quarter of an Hour.SOPHIA.In Buckram, my Lord!—He was got with my
Property here, and I wou'd have chastis'd him for
it, if your Coming had not prevented it.DAFFODIL.Let us throw the Rascal into Rosamond's Pond.Lord RACKET.Come Sir, can you swim?[All going up. TUKELY snatches SOPHIA's
Sword, and she runs behind him.TUKELY.I'll defend you, my Dear—What, wou'd you
murder a Man, and lie with his Wife too?—Oh!
you are a wicked Gentleman, Mr. Daffodil.[Attacks DAFF.DAFFODIL.Why, the Devil's in the Woman, I think.[All the Ladies advance from behind.LADIES.Ha, ha, ha! your humble Servant, Mr. Daffodil—
Ha, ha, ha.[Courtsying.DAFFODIL.This is all Enchantment!Lady PEWIT.No, Sir, the Enchantment is broke—and the
old Maid, Sir, homely and wanton, before she
retires into the Country, has the Satisfaction of
knowing that the agreeable Mr. Daffodil is a much
more contemptible Mortal, than the Footman which
his Goodness has been pleas'd to marry her to.LADIES.Ha, ha, ha.Widow DAMPLY.Wou'd Mr. Daffodil please to have a Pinch of
Spanish Snuff, out of the Great Mogul's Box? 'Tis
the best Thing in the World for low Spirits.[Offers her Box.LADIES.Ha, ha, ha.Mrs. DOTTEREL.If a Fool may not be permitted to speak, Mr.
Daffodil, let her at least be permitted to laugh at so
fine a Gentleman—Ha, ha, ha.ARABELLA.Were you as sensible of Shame, as you are of Fear,
the Sight of me, whom you lov'd for Pity, wou'd
be Revenge sufficient—But I can forgive your Baseness
to me, much easier than I can myself, for my
Behaviour to this happy Couple.DAFFODIL.Who the Devil are they?ARABELLA.The Marquiss and Marchioness of Macaroni, Ladies
—Ha ha.SOPHIA.Ha! Mio Carrissimo Amico, il Signior Daffodillo!DAFFODIL.How! Tukely and Sophia!—If I don't wake soon,
I shall wish never to wake again.SOPHIA.Who bids fairest now for Rosamond's Pond?Lord RACKET.What, in the Name of Wonder, is all this Business?
I don't understand it.DIZZY.Nor I neither; but 'tis very drole, faith.TUKELY.The Mystery will clear in a Moment.DAFFODIL.Don't give yourself any Trouble, Mr. Tukely,
Things are pretty clear as they are—The Night's
cool, and my Cousin Dizzy, here, is an Invalid—
If you please, another Time, when there is less Company,
[Ladies laugh]— The Ladies are pleas'd to be
merry, and you are pleas'd to be a little angry; and
so, for the Sake of Tranquility—I'll go to the Opera.[DAFF. sneaking out by Degrees.Lord RACKET.This is a fine blow-up, indeed! Ladies, your
humble Servant—Hallo! Daffodil.[Exit Lord RACK.DIZZY.I'll lay you a Hundred, that my Cousin never intrigues
again—George! George! Don't run—hugh,
hugh—[Exit DIZ.TUKELY.As my Satisfaction is compleat, I have none to ask
of Mr. Daffodil. I forgive his Behaviour to me, as it
has hasten'd and confirm'd my Happiness here; [to
Sophia.]— But as a Friend to you, Ladies, I shall insist
upon his making you ample Satisfaction—However,
this Benefit will arise, that you will hereafter equally
detest and shun these Destroyers of your Reputation—In You Coquettry is a Loss of Fame;But in Our Sex, 'tis that detested Name,That marks the Want of Manhood, Virtue, Sense,
and Shame.FINIS.
