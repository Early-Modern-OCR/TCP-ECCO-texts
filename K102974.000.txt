WHITESTONE, R. MONCRIEFFE, C. JENKIN, T. WALKER, R. BURTON, and P. BYRN. MDCCLXXXI.TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE HENRY LORD VISCOUNT PALMERSTON, OF THE KINGDOM OF IRELAND; THE FOLLOWING TRAGEDY IS INSCRIBED BY HIS LORDSHIP'S OBLIGED AND MOST OBEDIENT HUMBLE SERVANT,J. DELAP.Advertisement.It may perhaps be necessary to acquaint the reader, that Euripides has written a tragedy upon the same subject. In his Heraclidae, Macaria is sacrificed in the second act, and never afterwards mentioned; and Acamas is a mute. Indeed the whole conduct of this play is so entirely different from that of the Greek poet, that the author is hardly conscious to himself of having borrowed any thing more from him, than the general idea of the Suppliants taking refuge in the temple, and Macaria's voluntary offer of her own life.PROLOGUE.Written by a FRIEND.WITH countenance thrice chang'd from red to pale,Our author sends me forth to tell his tale;Croesus said he—who rul'd those lands that lie—Croesus—the Nabob of Antiquity:When satiated with war, with wealth, with praise,Defir'd new pleasures still to sooth his days;And publish'd vast rewards (sure out of spite)To him who should produce some new delight;This flame unquench'd burns on from age to age,Panting for novelty you seek our stage:To please this taste, a classic bard will try,To make soft bosoms heave a classic sigh;Feel Deianira's faded charms, and traceAlcides' godlike virtues in his race:Hard is the task who strives your praise to gain,And hard the part a poet must sustain.Herculean labours might our Prologue fill,And prove the club less powerful than the quill,To clear the course, to turn the tide of wit,To charm the watchful dragon of the pit;The Hydra's hiss to check, the giants quell,And bind the barking Cerberus of Hell,
Might the best strength of Hercules require,Tho' to his force were added Orpheus' lyre:Yet will we not despond—Alcides' raceIn every one's remembrance holds a place;The tale has trembled on each infant tongue,The tale that Busby taught—that Dryden sung:This night attend, one generous tear bestow,To weep the hero's wrongs, the daughter's woe,Like kind protectors grant the widow's suit,And crown your poet with the golden fruit.Dramatis Personae.DEMOPHON, King of Athens,Mr. BENSLEY.ACAMAS, his Brother,Mr SMITH.HYLLUS, Son of Deianira,Mr. BANNISTER, Jun.IOLAUS Friend of Deianira,Mr. AICKIN.ALCANDER, Herald from Eurystheus,Mr. FARREN.THESTOR, a Priest,Mr. PACKER.HAEMON, an Officer attending Deianira.Mr. WILLIAMS.OFFICER,Mr. R.

THE ROYAL SUPPLIANTS.ACT I.IOLAUS, and others, round an Altar near the Temple of Jupiter.IOLAUS.HERE, wretched outcasts! poor remains of friendsTo him who once was Hercules, rest here.Jove's altar be your refuge. May it checkEurystheus' impious rage; and, like a tower,Baffle the bloody tyrant, who from ArgosExiles the royal race; and now forbidsEach state to shelter our distress. Thine only,Athenian Demophon, remains untried:Grant heaven!—
Enter HAEMON.Oh, Haemon, never to my eyesMore welcome was thy presence. Faithful servant,Is Deianira, is Macaria lodgedSafe in yon shrine?Haem.Spite of Eurystheus' spies,Who chaced their flight; by the moon's waining orbBefriended, safely in yon shrine are lodgedMother and daughter.Iol.Gracious are ye, gods!And my soul bends devoutly to your thrones,For lives preserved far dearer than my own.Haem.Th' imperial widow there of great AlcidesMourns, with a mourning universe, the fateOf her illustrious lord; in whose sad tombLye buried all her hopes.Iol.Grant her, good heaven,That fortitude her age requires, to bearThe mighty loss. For, oh, her feeble frame,By woes made feebler; and the thousand perilsOf this dread flight—Haem.With toil and grief o'erpower'd,Nature gives way, and in short broken slumbersA transient respite feels. Through the lone ile,At day-break, I drew near; and saw MacariaWith anxious tenderness scarce breathing o'er her,A sigh, that would not be supprest, broke forth;While from her eye, half-glimmering with a smile,Stole such a tear as burnt upon my heart,Strait I retired unseen. Oh, Iolaus,What can thy love, thy wisdom now devise,To turn misfortune's torrent, that bears downEach rising hope?Iol.This day decides our doom.Haem.If Demophon reject us—Iol.We are dustBefore the whirlwind of Eurystheus' wrath.—But lead me to the temple.Haem.The gate opens;And lo, Macaria—Iol.What a soul of sorrow!O'er her wan visage melancholy throwsIts mournful ensign; yet that conscious air,That decent dignity, which makes grief proudOf such a consort, mark her for the daughterOf the world's hero. Haemon, to the city;And learn if any herald be arrivedTo cross our purpose.[Exit Haemon.MACARIA descends with Virgins.Ever-honoured lady?If that an old man's aid—Mac.I will shake off [not regarding Iolaus.This feebleness. My powers, lose not your functions.Softly, dear virgins, softly; the least whisperWakes her. A little longer, balmy sleep,Spread thy still pinions; in oblivious dewsHer senses steep a little longer yet;Grief soon enough will rouse them. How I hasteTo know the worst can happen. Iolaus!So soon to see thee, after our dread parting,My virtuous friend!Iol.Welcome to my sad heart,As the dear drops that nourish it! But whitherGoest thou, sweet maid, with such disorder'd step?No new affliction?Mac.In a breast o'er-flowing,Like Deianira's, can misfortune findA place for new affliction? yet, poor queen!Hopeless, she talks of hope; and would gild o'erThe sorrow that consumes her, with a smile,In pity to her daughter. Oh, that fiendEurystheus! the detested cause of all!Think of his fierce immitigable hateTo Hercules! Think with what fortitudeMy noble sire sustained a life of labours,
That savages would shrink from! And shall vengeanceSleep, till the wretch exterminates our race?First down to Tartarus!—Oh, pardon, pardonMy nature's rashness. I am calm again;I'll listen to thy council, which has everBeen wise and wholesome; for unless thy friendshipStill lends thy sheltering succour to thy queen—Iol.Ah, what can I, alas, feeble old man!Mac.Let her but hear thy voice. Alas, alas!To wretchedness like her's, the very voiceOf friendship yields relief. Let her but seeThy pitying eye, but not suffused with tears,Thou good old man! no, dry thy tears, and speak,Fallacious tho' they be, some lenient wordsThat sound like comfort. I the while will go—Why shrinks my heart? Why faulters thus my tongue,As Demophon were dangerous? I'll go to him.Iol.Unknown! unguarded! go to DemophonUncalled! Thy heart, Macaria, well may shrink,And thy tongue faulter. I have caught th' alarm.Thy filial piety, too generous maid!Unwarily betrays thee.Mac.Well I knowThy friendly fears; he is not Acamas!That high heroic spirit, who amongstThe foremost sons of Argos famous stood.'Twas not in praise of Demophon, the tongueOf fame grew lavish.Iol.But from Acamas,His brother, there's small hope: all kingly powerIs lodg'd in Demophon; be counsel'd then.Till his heart's soften'd to receive thy suit,Quit not the sanctuary.Mac.More forciblyThan fear can counteract, an unseen handUrges me on. I feel, I fell within,A more than mortal earnest of success;Let not thy doubts oppose it. Oft I've heard,
There is an eloquence in artless grief,Of power to melt the sternest. I'll essay.That power on Demophon.Iol.My words are vain.Go then, Macaria, if it must be so,Obedient to thy monitory call.And, Dryas, thou, and ancient Amycus,Silent attend the princess. You are suppliants,Soliciting relief; let every look,And every motion, suit that humble state.Mac.Wise, Iolaus, is thy wary charge.And now, inspired with boldness, on I go,Secure in heaven.[Exit Macaria attended.Iol.May gracious heaven, which lovesThat virtue which so sorely it afflicts,Thy soul's desires indulge thee!—Here's my post;This altar, and that temple—here I'll watch,One day; perhaps the only one, that fateHas now to give me.Enter HAEMON.Haemon back so soon?What tidings dost thou bring?Haem.Tidings to thrillThy heart with horror. Scarcely had I enteredYon winding vale, when suddenly I heardThe steps of men advancing. Eagerly,And all at once, sometimes they seemed to talk,Loud was their leader's voice above the rest;And soon his cruel eye, and haughty port,Proclaimed him the stern herald of Eurystheus.Iol.Alcander?Haem.He, whose rancorous revengePursues us thro' the world.Iol.Remorseless villain!Yet Haemon, villain as he is, fear not.This shrine's our sanctuary; its awful God,
Whose word controuls the fury of the floods,Shall baffle the base plots of impious men.Haem.Heard you that shriek?Iol.It was Macaria's voice!And lo, Alcander!—Haemon, rush between—She's lost!—Alcander, like a ravening vulture,Seizes his prey!Enter MACARIA, &c. pursued by ALCANDER.Mac.God of the temple! save,Oh save thy trembling suppliant!Iol.Hell-hound, stop!Thou slave to a vile tyrant! what fresh maliceIs thy black bosom fraught with?Alcan.Fond old man!Whither art thou transported? Yield Macaria.Eurystheus has proscribed your wretched lives.Yield to your king:Iol.Not while this arm can save her.Haem.Lady, this way.Mac.Yes, lead me from the sightOf that unhallowed monster.—Hah, presum'st thouT'advance one impious step?—hold, on thy life.The bolt of Jove is lifted—wretch, beholdThe sanctuary, and tremble.Exit with Haemon to the Temple.Alcan.Long thou shalt notA sanctuary find it.Iol.From her countryAlready hast thou forced her. Would'st thou more?Ah, suffer her the mournful privilegeTo breathe in exile.Alcan.Still dost thou pretend!Thus then I crush thy age.Iol.Help, men of Athens!Forbear! 'tis worse than murder.—Hah, respectThe altar of a God omnipotent.
Enter ACAMAS, with Guards.Aca.Whence these loud outcries, that profane the temple.Of him who thunders?—Peace, I charge you, peace.Bring forth th' offender, as you dread the weightOf our displeasure. Acamas commands—Bring forth th' offender:Iol.Royal Acamas,Protect an old man, outraged by that wretch;Who, in contempt of every sacred rite,From Jove's own altar drags me.Aca.Rash, rash man!Whom I—but first inform me, reverend stranger,What country claims thy birth, and what thy name.Iol.Mycenae is my country; and my nameHerculean Iolaus.Aca.Whence are those?Iol.Sad Deianira's suppliant train, imploringThine, and yon temple's refuge, from the rageOf merciless Eurystheus.Alcan.Yet that templeShall not secure them from their rightful lord,Who here demands his slaves.Aca.Suppress thy tongue,Irreverent as thou art! and mark my words:Till Demophon's return from Marathon,With whose young prince he went to celebrate.His daughter's spousals, all authorityDevolves on Acamas.—I'm Athen's king;And I forbid all force.Alcan.Why then by forceDost thou with-hold the vassals of Eurystheus?Aca.Are they not suppliants?—To violateThe rites of hospitality, rejectThe poor man's suit, who only has his prayers,His humble prayers, and miseries to protect him,Would make the good gods shudder on their thrones.
Enter MACARIA from the Temple.Mac.'Tis Acamas himself!—restrain me not.A thousand doubts, a thousand apprehensions!But a lov'd mother's dangers drive me on:They put a tongue in the mute lips of fear;Inspire me with new courage.—On the ground,Trembling, I clasp thy knees!—Oh Acamas!If ever thou hast felt, as sure thou hast,The tender touch of nature—If the anguishOf a sad daughter for the best, alas!The wretchedest of mothers!—my despair,Oh whither doth it drive!—let thy own heartTell thee, what grief like mine wants words to utter.—Say, while I've sense to hear, that DeianiraIs safe—That Acamas protects her—bidsMacaria live in her dear mother's life!Aca.Macaria here at Athens!—as from heavenSome blessed spirit spoke, my every senseIs wrapt in admiration!—'tis Macaria!Her voice, her mien!—such the bright blaze of beautyThat burst on me at Argos!—What rude handCould injure that fair form; which my heart worship'd,When my enchanted eyes first gazed upon thee?Divine Macaria, speak!Mac.Eurystheus!—oh,His very name into distraction throwsMy powers, and choaks all utterance?—With me kneel,Ye venerable friends of Hercules!And tell, for his sad daughter, the distressOf a poor queen, and princess; driven like slavesFrom realm to realm.—My brother too, dear youth!If scap'd the assassin's dagger, he still breathesThe vital air: to Acamas commend him!Oh, Sir! to Hyllus, Deianira, all,
Be a protector from the bloodiest tyrant!The most remorseless wretch!Aca.Rise, royal maid,Of every wish secure. The utmost graceMy power can grant, his daughter well may claim,Whose godlike friendship from the realms of deathRescued my sire.Mac.Tears are but fruitless thanks.Yet are they all th' unhappy have to give;Take them, and let thy charitable heartSupply the rest.—Now say, thou bold, bad man! [to Alcander.Alcan.I waste no further words.—If thou respect'st [to Acamas.The friendship of Eurystheus, render backThese fugitive remains of Hercules,That public ravager.—Mac.Inhuman russian!Whose savage tongue even wretchedness insults;Insults the ashes of that god on earth;Who, could he hear such profanation!—Rise,Thou mighty spirit! clad in horrors, comeForth from thy tomb! even at thy very look,This wretch, his tyrant, every slave thro' allHis host, would quake to death!Alcan.Such pageantrySuits not Alcander; whose indignant kingExpects an answer.Aca.Take this answer back,First tell thy king what thou at Athens seest;Tell what thou hear'st; then say, while AcamasRules in this land of liberty, no tyrantShall force our injured suppliant from his shrine.Alcan.Hah, is this Acamas? not more for valourThan wisdom famed.—Not thus, if I know aughtOf reverend Thestor, whose divine forecastMakes him oracular; not thus would heCounsel his king. Consult him; be not rash;Thou speak'st the fate of thousands.Aca.Insolent!Hast thou not heard? Retire.Alcan.Then hear, Eurystheus;War, instant war, 'gainst Athens I denounce.A valiant host, led by their valiant king,Moves on.—Ere sun-rise at your gates expectThe conqueror!Exit.Mac.Dreadful his defiance sounds.And to my frightful fancy wasteful warIn all its horrors rises.—He, perhaps,The generous friend, whose soul now melts to seeGriefs not his own; even Acamas may fall!Aca.Were Acamas the noblest of his line,Could he more nobly fall? Had I a lifeFor every peril, in a cause like thisI'd risk them all with transport! Ah, restrainThose lovely tears. I swear, no power on earthShall harm Macaria, while these arms can bearThe shield and sword before her.Mac.To the queen,With heart o'erflowing, suffer me t' impartThis gracious goodness. Would to heaven, my HyllusWere present now to share it, the young soldierOf generous Acamas.Aca.Would heaven, he were!I long to clasp him. Iolaus, sendA herald forth; I long to lead to warThe brother of Macaria.Mac.Heaven, that knowsHow much he wants a friend like Acamas,From its blest fount thy charity repay!Exit.Aca.My tongue makes no reply.—I cannot stop;I cannot follow her.—How quickly, oh,How subtly something steals thro' every vein;Another soul, I think—Enter an OFFICER.Offi.Far as the eyeFrom yonder tower can reach, a cloud of dustDarkens the air; while thro' it break by fits
Bright transient flashes; such as to the sunGlitter from pikes and helmed heads: it seemsHitherward moving.Aca.On my life, Eurystheus!The usurper, by this fraudful march, would takeAt unawares our troops, would terrifyOur suppliants from the temple. He shall find,Rash as he is, the justice of our causeLaughs at surprize, not fears it.—Where's my armour?My soul's i' th' field already—nay, dispatch—My spear, my target.—Cheerly do my spiritsCourse their quick round. In air I seem to tread,Moved magically on.—Divine Macaria!Thy beauty—'tis thy virtue!—forth I go,To prove their power upon a soldier's sword.Exit.END OF THE FIRST ACTACT II.Flourish of Trumpets.Enter ACAMAS and Officers.ACAMAS.LEAD to the grove the light-armed troop—call Sicyon.Now, my brave friends! who side by side with me,Full many a time have fought; fellows in arms,Attend; for never a more glorious causeCalled your young valour forth: 'tis Deianira,The great Alcides' widow: 'tis Macaria,Whose wrongs and beauty might with hero's fireWarm the cold coward's heart. These Royal SuppliantsAsk your bold aid against that black usurper,Who comes from Argos with a cursed designTo drag them from your shrines. And will not eachAthenian sword start forth? If public honour,If reverence for your altars, if compassion,That noblest virtue of a noble mind,If these can fire your breasts, in this day's battleStrain every nerve; oh, fight it to the death.And now go forth; go each among the lines;Rouze, animate the soldiers, man by man.—Menas?[Exit Officers.Offi.My lord.—Aca.Thou, Menas, with thy troop,Shalt guard this temple, and its royal guests,Till my return from th' onset. Would to heavenI were sole combatant! in single fight,Shield against shield, to grapple with yon tyrant,Beneath Macaria's banners. 'Twas at ArgosMy eyes first caught her charms; and here my soul
Each hour is more her captive. Fancy dwellsEnchanted on th' idea; on my earsStill floats her tongue's sweet melody, and swaysThe motion of my heart.Offi.Another signal,And louder than the last.—Aca.It sounds to arms.March my battalion to the western gate.[Exit Officer.—What, Sicyon, hoa!—the soldiers' hearts are mine;Mine too their arms, till Demophon's return,And nobly will I use them. Should he come,My hopes were air. Oh, not one moment thenWill I trust fate.—Give me, dread god of war!In this day's fight, some portion of thy ownTerrific spirit.—Enter an OFFICER.Offi.Demophon, my lord—Aca.Hah, what of Demophon?Offi.With all his trainEnters the gates from Marathon.Aca.No—No.—Offi.My gracious lord, I saw him; while his son,Young Conon, with the troops of royal guards,Marched towards the grove.Aca.Oh, death to all my hopes!Back, and inform thee better—nay remain.What's to be done? his cold, his gloomy spiritBlunts every sword, and deadens every heart.What's to be done?—Alcander, was he with him?Offi.With most obsequious reverence, I beheld himTender the king a paper, as he enter'dThe shrine of Juno.Aca.Vengeance on the villain!Worse than a poisonous mineral he works here;The traitor teems with wiles. I'll cross upon them;I'll rouze this brother to defy Eurystheus.Should he, by priestly phantoms terrified,
Refuse to fight—should he presume to yield,To yield Macaria! horrible surmise!"Be my protector!" was the dear maid's prayerUpon her trembling knees. Thou, holy altar!Hear and attest my vow. I will by heaven![Exit.Enter ALCANDER.Alcan.Yonder he stalks; and all full freedom leaves meTo work upon the priest, and credulous king;And force the temple's portal to let forthIts royal victims. Now my bark's afloat,And to Eurystheus' throne, on a full tide,Will bear me, if my marriage with his sisterFail not.—But still this headlong Acamas!He is a rock will wreck us. DemophonIs jealous of him: on that jealousyI'll strike a dangerous, superstitious spark,Soon to flame forth. At Juno's temple nowHe makes a holy halt; the interim's mineHere with old Thestor. Wherefore loiters thusThe reverend dreamer, whose high sanctityThe magic power of gold must move to murder?Enter THESTOR.Oh, art thou come at length, my ancient friend?Ancient, but, ah! how unimpaired by age!Time, that digs deep his furrows on most brows,Only gives comlier grace to Thestor's years,Adds reverence to the hairs it silvers o'er.Well, we are once more met; my king's concernsCall us in haste together: they are weighty,Nice, urgent, full of dexterous enterprize,And ask thy secret, sudden aid.Thes.If theyAught of religious import bear, (as whatBut sacred purposes claim Thestor's counsel)
Impart them to the servant of the god,Whose conscientious mind—Alcan.I know it well;Well as I know thy zeal, thy friendly zealProved oft in times long past, which now AlcanderMeans to prove home again. Nearer, good Thestor.Thou see'st yon shrine; thou know'st what fugitives,Its sanctuary shelters; and the hate,The mortal hate, Eurystheus bears their race,But chiefly bears Macaria; from whose loinsAnother race, more hateful, may come forth.Canst thou not then—Why do thy fearful eyesSo cautiously shun mine?—Canst thou not thenCall down a voice oracular from heaven,That claims a victim?—that Macaria claims?I know thou canst; and far be't from AlcanderTo question his friend's will.Thes.Is this thy friendship?The token this of thy high venerationFor Thestor's character? whose heart long sinceFrom this vain world estranged—Alcan.Old man!—but yetCalmly I'll commune with thee; I'll convinceThy scrupulous spirit that her single deathWill save the lives of thousands, which a warWith Argos must devote.Thes.The lives of thousandsLie on their consciences who wage the war.Shall Thestor's hands be stain'd with guiltless blood?Shall Thestor's tongue belye the temple's god?With a false oracle his thunders brave?—Th' engendering storm already!Alcan.These nice qualms,These conscientious horrors, were they wontTo stagger Thestor?—Wants the seer more warrantTo be oracular? Go then, consultThe entrails of your beasts, your babbling birds,And groaning oaks; or single forth some goat,Yeaned at full moon, and kill him with a knife,(Of that be sure) exactly shaped and sized.
This shall disarm your god of his red bolt,And make your murders holy.Thes.Such loud passion,Affronting to the god!—Alcan.Are you not all,Priestess and priest alike, the supple slavesOf interest? Whence your tripods and your crowns,Statues of gold and silver, glittering gemsThat sanctify your shrines? Whence this vast splendour?And what, but the rich bribes of crafty knaves,And superstitious cowards?—One word moreOf hypocritic mummery, and, by heaven,I will unfold such scenes!—Thes.Ungenerous man!Whose headlong phrenzy, on my least demur,Unmindful of all forms, all ceremonies,Of all past benefits, temple and priestWould overturn—Alcan.Why then the infirmityOf thy friend's temper urge to the extreme,Upon a point so trying?Thes.Hah! and isThe point to me less trying?—grant it just;(And sad necessity makes most things just)Yet, to pronounce a sacrifice at once—Shed, without hesitation, royal blood—No reverence had to my own fame; no careFor my own life, and every worldly hope.—Alcan.Thy fame, thy life, if there be confidenceIn a king's word, in friendship like Alcander's,Shall be secure; thy every worldly hope,To the minutest scruple, warranted.—And now, how softened seems that countenance,Which speaks, without a tongue, my friend's assent;Speaks him again my ancient honour'd Thestor!Here then, behold th' instructions: take them; read them;And with them take this pledge; Eurystheus sends it;
This gem from his own finger. Now dispatch;Pronounce the oracle; be firm; and prosper.[Exit Thestor.Now fate begins its work!—I have alreadyAlarmed the timorous temper of the kingAbout these fugitives.—But he approaches,Here to perform a superstitious vow,He made before his march to Marathon.Enter DEMOPHON and his train.Demo.How venerable the horror that enfoldsJove's holy temple! with profoundest aweBehold thy servant enters.Alcan.May its godInspire thy righteous spirit so to actAs best becomes his servant! This remember,The hand, the chastening hand of heaven lies onThese exiles; and each shrine, save this, oh king,Against them shut, as against things unholy.How desperate then to risk for them a war!Demo.Thy doubts already have found entrance here.Therefore, to know heaven's purpose, I have sentThe most inspired of all th' oracular priests,Our ancient Thestor; without whose sage voiceIn holy things we move not.Alcan.To his voice,As is most fit, I bow me. Yet hear further,What never oracle more truly spoke:Your brother's dangerous spirit, every hourMore dangerous by Macaria's matchless charms—Forgive my forward friendship—but beholdGraced with the royal ensigns, where he comesExulting on, in burnished armour clad,As he were Athens' king, and peace and warHung on his nod!—I must not stay to crossThe army's idol.[Exit.Enter ACAMAS.Aca.Back to Athens welcome,My royal brother.Demo.When we went from Athens,In peaceful garb was Acamas arrayed.The soldier's falchion now invests his thigh;The sun now glitters on his polished helm;And clanking arms and armour sound to war.Aca.And if war e'er was just, and heaven approved,'Tis now; when Deianira and Macaria,By a vile tyrant exiled, suppliants comeTo thee, and to the God whom thy religionDoth venerate in that shrine; which scarce protects themFrom the brute outrage of a haughty herald.I heard Macaria plead; and tears burst forth.Alcander spoke; and at each ruffian wordMy indignation burned. To hesitateIn such a cause were guilt.Demo.Thy passion speaks thisThe glittering glory of rash enterprizeFires thy transported spirit, that would flameThe meteor of a multitude's amaze,No thought beyond the present hour: unmindfulOf a king's duty; that the royal swordShould save, not sacrifice, a people's lives;And then be sheath'd, when it has fixt the baseOf future happiness; that each exploit,Weigh'd and digested deep, must be consign'd,In history's long roll, to times unborn,And stand their rigid test.Aca.Such then, such isTh' occasion this important hour presents.Stamp this exploit in history's long roll,To stand the rigid test of times unborn.Rouze then at once, insulted virtue cries,Rouze, and revenge!—the troops are marshalled—IWill march my veterans.Demo.Heedless of th' event;By heavenly admonition unassured,What would thy frantic fury?Aca.It would hurlYon ruthless ruffian headlong from the throneOf Argos, and restore its rightful heirs;Restore Alcides' royal race!—i'th' presenceOf Jove's dreadful sanctuary, I've given my wordIrrevocable!Demo.To embroil my kingdomIn civil factions, well as foreign war.Art thou to learn what spirits there are stirring,By their own vices ruin'd? bold, seditious,Desperate of what may happen; without hope,But from the general wreck—these are at work,All ready, like the pent-up pestilenceTo burst upon us!Aca.Oh, ignoble fear!Bane of all worth! which every sacred tye,The splendor of th' Athenian name, its glory,Would basely trample down. Shall then this state,Famed for its love of freedom thro' the world,And love of mercy—hah! shall generous AthensCrouch to Eurystheus? to an Argian tyrantIts royal suppliants yield?—My brother, no!They shall not quit the temple.Demo.Shall not quit?—Presumest thou with these fantastic flights,Romantic visions of a love-sick boy,To fright us to compliance?Aca.Lovesick boy?—Demo.That was my word.—Macaria? does the nameFlush with a crimson shame thy conscious cheek?The loves that revel in Macaria's eyes,These are the orators that plead for war;And these the generous virtues that would riskA kingdom's ruin.Aca.Well; Macaria thenSounds the alarm for war; her filial sighs,
The wrongs of weeping beauty, that might moveThe world to arms, move me.—I own the charge;I triumph in the weakness!—check thy scorn!Cast on thy slave, not me, that menacing frown,Proud king! for I will speak, when justice bids,Tho' death his dart shook at me.—With these suppliantsMy honour is at stake; dear as that honourI hold, and will protect them; tho' AlcanderHad every wile of every fiend—remember!For by the soul of my dread sire! the sword,To them, shall pass thro' me.Enter MACARIA.Mac.Did I not hearA voice like that of Acamas? or was itMy fancy's coinage?—hah!Demo.What sudden blazeOf beauty breaks upon me from the temple?By heaven, 'tis she! the syren that seduc'dMy brother: and no wonder! for her eyesHave witchcraft in them; and each lovely lookA melancholy grace that melts the soul.—Art thou Macaria?Mac.The distrest Macaria!Daughter of Deianira; and with her,Hither from Argos by Eurystheus driven;Where Acamas—may heaven reward his virtue!Saw, and supported us. Canst thou inform meOf my protector?Demo.Hence, this moment, lady,My brother went.Mac.And art thou Demophon,His brother? whom we owe a life of thanks.Oh, Sir, to him, to you, with gratitudeAs low as to our guardian gods we bend,For our late blessing. Like a chearful morn,Fair opening on a dark and dismal night,The gracious tidings came: they lifted up
The lamp of life just fading in her eye;And gave to a despairing daughter's heartA happy mother.Demo.In this changeful scene,No mortal creature, till the hour of fate,May be called happy.Mac.Yet might I entreat youTo cast one casual glance—admire the workOf your own goodness—heavens!—how changed from her,Who lately on the ground, on the cold groundLay hopeless, almost liseless.—With the sightOf her good genius bless her!Demo.Much Macaria,I fear, o'er-rates th' indulgence DemophonMay yield to Deianira.Mac.How such friendshipFills me with wonder! but a virtuous heartIs happy in the happiness it gives.Enter the shrine, and bless her with thy presence.Enter IOLAUS.Iol.Joy to Macaria! if 'tis joy to hearHyllus has scaped the tyrant's treacherous wilesT' ensnare his honoured life.Mac.Blest be the tongueThat speaks the tidings! Come, my Hyllus come!Ready to fold thee to his friendly breastStands Acamas; and Demophon will joinHis godlike brother! Oh, we're blest indeed!Son, mother, daughter, blest in two such friends!Solemn Music. Enter THESTOR, and Priests.Thes.Pause ye, my reverend brethren? Let no thought,Ill-omen'd look, or word, this place profane;With solemn silence all ye priests of heavenAttend. Brief are the words, and terrible,Of the dread oracle!Mac.What oracle!Thes.No interruption, maid. At thy command,Oh king, did we proclaim a sacrifice:Wrapt in celestial musings then approachedThese reverend sages; and with solemn voiceChaunted their holiest hymn; the shrines burnt brightWith sacred fires; and every altar sentIts swelling incense, on a hallowed cloud,To him on high.Mac.This dreadful preparation—Thes.When thus burst forth the awful voice:—"No steer,"No blood of bulls will now propitiate heaven"To grant success. Would Athens stand secure—"Would Hyllus save his royal father's throne,"And his own life—The blood of Deianira—Mac.Horror of horrors!—Deianira's blood!Thes.The priest of Jove with pitying eye beholdsThy suffering soul.

I yet survive! the dreadful soundsStill thunder in my ears!—my mother's blood!Tell me, tremendous god! what unknown crimeProvokes such vengeance? Why is it decreed,That the whole race of Hercules must feelThy horrible displeasure?Thes.Ah! presume not,Rash virgin, heavenly wisdom to arraign!Just is the god, tho' terrible; his willMust be obeyed.

Wherefore, in the bloomOf youth, should such unblemish'd virtue die?—Ponder a moment.Mac.Interrupt not, Sir,The solemn offering; which, for worlds, I would notShould now be frustrate. Holy men, proceed:For me death has no terrors. I conjure you,Ye delegates of heaven! obey heaven's voice.Lead to the altar; I implore to die.Demo.It must not be.—Thes.Heaven's voice hath spoke! What mortalMay dare gainsay the sentence?

My own religious purpose,Yet unperformed, at present claims my care;
That done, ye sage interpreters of heaven!We'll commune further.[Exeunt Demophon and Priests.Mac.Look not, Iolaus,With eyes like those.

Let Hyllus treadUpon his crouching neck; thence mount thethrone,His father's great avenger, and his own!DEIANIRA speaks.To thee, thus round the altar's base,Lost Deianira, and her suppliant train,Sigh their sad souls! oh, must they sigh in vain!Avenge, avenge thy royal race!Enter ACAMAS.Aca.Forgive the intrusion, royal dame, if thouArt Deianira, as this suppliant trainBespeaks thee; and those strains, that thro' the domeSwell'd to Alcides' praise; but, more than all,The features of that venerable face,From whence Macaria drew her virgin charms.
If thou art she, may Acamas intreatAn audience with thy daughter?Deia.Godlike youth!(For Godlike ever, Acamas will seem,In Deianira's eyes) unknown to meMy daughter went to supplicate the king;Grant heaven! she finds in him the noble friendShe found in his brave brother!Aca.I am her friend;Yes, 'tis the boast of Acamas, his glory,To be Macaria's friend. Oh, Deianira!Thou hear'st a soldier—my soul is in my tongue;I love thy daughter:—not the wonders onlyOf her fair form; yet, oh!—but that high honour,The stamp of her great sire; and every virtue,More virtuous made by filial piety,Have fix'd my love. To her I dedicateMy life; and, on this sword, avow myselfThe champion of her wrongs, and Deianira's.Deia.She has been ever good, and heaven rewardsHer virtue, in the generous prince it raifesFor her, and my protector. Hapless Hyllus!He scarce hath been so fortunate. Where now,Friendless and comfortless, wanders my son?Aca.Hither I came, resolved on secrecy;But, oh! that anxious tenderness, that sigh,Heaved from the bottom of a mother's breast,Unfix my purpose. Know then, Hyllus lives;And, more to move thy wonder, he lives here,A soldier in th' Athenian camp, disguisedFrom every eye but mine: to me, this moment,The secret he entrusted.Deia.Quickly bear me,Oh bear me to my boy—Aca.A little longerBe mistress of yourself; this transport checkA little longer; till occasion callsThe gallant youth. By Demophon's commandThe priests prepare a sacrifice; that finished,
Hither will I conduct him. The meanwhileSafe let the secret in your bosom sleep,And trust the rest to Acamas.Deia.Oh, bornTo counteract the cruelty of fate,And make life worth a wish! in thee I'll trust;My son shall be thy soldier.Aca.He and IWill make Eurystheus shrink beneath our swords.The troops of Argos too, tho' now compelledTo rise 'gainst Hyllus in rebellious arms,Will drop their weapons, when their wondering eyesView their own hero, in th' Athenian ranks,Gaunt with revenge, and terrible in wrongs,Like a young son of Mars!Enter HYLLUS, like a Soldier.Hyl.The troops, my lord—Hah! Deianira here?—my honour'd mother!Deia.Dear to thy mother's heart!—oh let me thus,And thus enfold my Hyllus! how at sightOf my loved boy the sun of heaven resumesIts wonted glory! this is life indeed!This to a mother's winterly old ageRestores a youthful spring! tell, tell me all;Where, where hast thou been wandering? how cam'st hither,Oh too adventurous! to these longing arms?Hyl.Thou shalt hear all: to thy impatient earsMy heart I'll open; tell thee, thro' what perilsI reach'd th' Athenian camp; with AcamasTo make one last bold effort—but time flies;And dangerous is delay.—I now am hereTo tell thee, prince, Eurystheus' troops are onFull march to Athens.—Shall we give them battle?Blow loud the blast of war! let, let it rouzeThe spirit of its god within my breast!I burn for vengeance!Aca.Vengeance thou shalt have.But now, young soldier, temper this rash fire,Whose blaze may else betray thee: recollectA mother and a sister.Hyl.Dearer bothThan his own life to Hyllus!Deia.Yet thou hast notBeheld thy sister?Hyl.I beheld Macaria,(And my heart yearn'd to speak, as I beheld her)Move tow'rds the palace, with a suppliant train.Anxious her looks, and pale her languid cheeks:Th' admiring multitude, as she past on,Gazed with an eye that pity had suffusedWith many a tear. I stopt, with wonder struck.She enter'd then.—There is no mischief meant—No plot against her?—by th' immortal spiritOf great Alcides! I would fire the palace,And rescue her dear life!Aca.With DeianiraWait my return. Be cautious; Hyllus onlyCan betray Hyllus; warned again, beware.Hyllus is now my soldier.Exit.Deia.Oh, my son!I fear thy fortune yet, against Eurystheus,That bloody tyrant! who, by fire-eyed Mars,Horribly swears, his rage shall never die,Never know peace, till on thy neck he plantsHis mortal foot, and crushes all our race!Hyl.His foot on me! more safe might he bestrideThe angry surge, when tempests toss the seas.Deio. Oh, moderate thy rage, th' untimely deathOf many a gallant spirit!Hyl.He dies blest,Who, dying, slays the villain he detests.Deia.How wildly dost thou start! thy struggling soulShoots thro' thine eyes. Oh, with less horror look!Less fixed to rush on fate! pity thy mother!
She has no son but thee! oh, leave EurystheusTo Jove's dread bolt.Hyl.To Jove I offer himIn dreadful sacrifice. Jove smiles well pleased,When from his heaven the god beholds his altarSmoke with a tyrant's blood.Deia.My gallant boy!Alas, too noble!—let me gaze thee o'er;Let me find where that godlike spirit dwells,That lifts thee thus aloft. So frowned his sire,When with undaunted heart his young arm struckThe Cleonaean savage. Looks he notAs some superior power within movedEach animated grace?Enter ACAMAS.Aca.The king approaches.At once retire, so please you, to the altar,The inmost altar.Deia.Lead, my reverend friends.While Deianira retires, the Train sings,Vengeance on curst Eurystheus' head!God of the shrine! let Hyllus treadUpon his crouching neck: thence mount the throne,His father's great avenger, and his own!Exeunt Deianira, &c.HYLLUS and ACAMAS.Hyl.Thy looks are troubled! some accursed chance!What have they done? what dared?—By heaven, that silenceCasts on the heart of Hyllus more alarm,Than mortal man e'er gave it!Enter DEMOPHON.Demo.These are thy exploits!

I will rouzeAll Athens.—Hah! perhaps my own brave troops—The fate of Deianira and Macaria,Tyrant! shall seal thy own!Exit.Enter THESTOR and ALCANDER.Alcan.We marked this menace;His fiery visage grim with ire; like someDistemper'd sky before the bursting bolt.Demo.At the least check his lion-heart flies forth,And knows nor king, nor brother.Thes.It affrontsThe awful silence of the place, and makesThe altars tremble.Demo.What, if the rash youthShould, in his frenzy, make a desperate onsetWith his battalions!—Alcan.Therefore, without pause,The willing victim yield. We'll find a meansTo counteract him; only yield Macaria,Thy safety now the sacrifice requires.Thes.And heaven again demands it. We once moreInvoked the sacred oracle; once moreThe sacred oracle pronounced her doom.Tempt not the gods too far; be warned of heaven.Alcan.For if Macaria lives, she lives a brandTo fire thy kingdom. Acamas will wed her;And war with Argos, an eternal war,Shall Athens wage.Thes.A war, with gods averse.Oh tremble at the thought!Demo.With gods averse!—How weak is mortal wisdom, mortal might!Thes.Obedient then to heaven, the victim yield.Alcan.And lo, as hither brought by heaven's own hand,To force thee to thy good, Macaria comes.Enter MACARIA.Mac.Yet, I behold her not—celestial guardiansOf innocence, watch o'er her! Should her blood,Oh horrible! be shed for mine—oh king!Torn with a thousand terrors, from the palaceI've hurried to the temple—let me dieFor a loved parent!—hah! while thus thou turn'stFrom me, take heed, rash king! thou turn'st from Jove,Whose voice commands the victim.Demo.Lead along,Interpreters of heaven; and thou, Macaria,Wait here awhile.

Loud throbs? why rush my spirits thro' my breast?If innocence shake thus, what ribs of steelMay bide the beating of a guilty heart,When sounds the mortal summons?—hah, the gatesUnfold; and Deianira quits the temple!Enter DEIANIRA.Deia.It was her voice—hark, hark! I could not err.Mac.Heavens!Deia.Thro' the vaulted arch of this lone ilePlaintive it past along.Mac.Protect me! save,Oh save me from a mother's eye, that strikesAll resolution dead.Deia.Art thou return'd,My life? ah, what delay, this tedious hour,Has held thee from thy mother's heart, that longsThus eagerly to clasp thee?Mac.Oh, my mother!Close to thy bosom clasp thy child, who loves,For ever loves thee!Deia.The loud storm, that lateSo thunder'd in our ears, is rolling off;The troubled air's at rest; and every fearFlies before chearful hope. I've seen thy brother—Why dost thou sigh? thou too shalt see him; thouShalt soon embrace my boy.—How my heart triumphsAt thy approaching fortune! With what pride,What exultation; shall Mycenae welcomeHer favourite virgin! With what envious eyesBehold the mother of a child like thee!Mac.Thy virtues, Deianira, merit moreThan such a child can give.Deia.How faintly fallsEach accent from thy tongue; and sure thy eyesGlance on thy mother with a joyless smile,That hardly hides a tear?Mac.With the same eyes,Still, still do I behold thee; but so usedTo weep, involuntary tears will start.Deia.Come, let me kiss them dry. Perish Eurystheus!Whose cruelties have thus o'erpower'd thy spirits.Mac.His death will cost his conquerors a dear triumph!Deia.Yet let him die! barbarian! let him perish!How dear soe'er the purchase.Mac.Can I hear,And not forewarn her of th'impending ruin,Ready to rush upon her?Deia.Said they notThe priests prepare a sacrifice?—the bloodOf that, ye pitying powers! I hope will endThine and my sorrows. Are the rites begun?Soon will the victim bleed?Mac.Too soon thou'lt think it.Deia.Would heaven!

Is she to presideAt the high sacrifice?—Or, may it be!
To solemnize with her his brother's nuptials?Yet sure a mother would at such an hourProve no unwelcome guest?Mac.For heaven's sake, stir not;Quit not the temple; let me, let me go,Safe in this stranger's conduct.Deia.Stay one moment.Something I had to say—one little momentIndulge a mother's fondness. Ah, Macaria!How precious is one moment, when we partWith all that's dearest!—see these foolish tears!But my fond eyes, when next we meet, shall gazeWith double transport on thee!Mac.Death hath notA keener pang!Deia.This one embrace!—and now,Now, honoured stranger, to thy hands I trust—What words shall say how much! but on thy browThere is a virtue claims all trust.

Deianira here!—Deia.Heaven guard my son!What means that wild emotion? Speak, beforeMy apprehensive spirit—Enter ACAMAS.Hyl.Oh, Acamas!Aca.I know thy fears, and came-to check th' alarm.There is no danger, lady; be composed.It was Alcander's infamous device;But the king's undeceived.Deia.Oh, you have banishedA thousand terrors!—Aca.Demophon's our friend:Against Eurystheus he denounces war;And Acamas, by his command, even nowMarches to meet th' usurper.Deia.Thanks, kind gods!Protectors of my child!Hyl.Oh, there is lifeIn these great tidings!—Hyllus, Hyllus thenShall march to meet th' usurper!Aca.Hyllus shall:In all his guilty pomp, furious he comes,T' arrest the rolling thunder of our wrath,Or sink before it.Deia.Oh, tremendous hour!Hyl.Farewell! farewell, my mother! hence I go,At fate's high call.Deia.Go then, my only boy!Remember what Alcides was, and conquer![Exeunt Hyllus and Acamas.—How all on fire for fame his spirits flashedAs he shot forth! I tremble at his valour!Alas, his virtues are too terrible!—But he is gone to battle. Mighty Mars!Go with him forth!

Thou, in whose breastEternal hatred 'gainst Alcides' raceDwells unextinguished! To thy altar, queen,Lo, I devote his daughter! here, this hour,In spite of Acamas, Marcaria dies!Enter THESTOR from the Temple.Thes.Alcander's order Thestor has obeyed;Yet vainly sure the altars now must blaze,Without a victim; when thy mortal foeTh' Athenian army heads; when AcamasThe bold, th' intrepid, is gone forth to fight,Perhaps to slay Eurystheus. That, at once,Tumbles thy towering projects down; and allThy statesman's wiles are air.Alcan.And is AlcanderThus known? Vain augur, there will be no battle:I sent forth Acamas; by my instructionsHe heads th' Athenian army; at his will,Alcander this tremendous hero moves,The puppet of his pleasure. Demophon
Has fool'd his brother with a mock command;And after him sent orders, on his life,Not to engage Eurystheus. Now believ'st thouThy altars smoke in vain?Thes.That's a deviceOf policy indeed!Alcan.The same instructionsGo to each chief; while Conon, the king's son,I, for a special purpose, have dispatched,To make Eurystheus privy to the plot,And bid him in his own entrenchments keep.Thes.But still, should Acamas attack the ranks?—Alcan.They are too strong; he dares not. On the heightsEurystheus is well posted, and must baffleHis boldest efforts. There will be no battle.Thes.Meantime, Macaria—Alcan.True; while her mock heroVaunts it before the troops, Macaria diesAt Juno's altar. Speed thee to the king,Ere he finds time to cool; into his breastInfuse, as thou art wont, religious awe.Go then, without delay, his fancy frightWith slighted oracles, and vengeful godsReady to bolt their thunder.Exit Thestor.Triumph nowMy heart! now glory in a daring deed,Which fools call villainy, who want the spiritTo be successful villains. In my viewGlitters the crown of Argos; my hands nowThe sceptre seem to grasp; and by my sideEurystheus' sister sits in regal state:My hopes can soar no higher; one cloud onlyLours o'er my prospect. Hyllus!—curse uponThe forward stripling. Hyllus lives! were heOnce placed within my compass—but this handMust crush him, and it shall. I have alreadySent forth a secret sword.

That power I'll quickly furnish; play the sonAn engine on his sire.Enter IOLAUS.Iol.Behold the wretch,Whose footsteps I've been tracing.

But ruin gathersAlready o'er Eurystheus' head and thine.Prophetic are my words: and Hyllus, Hyllus,Comes to fulfil the prophecy.Alcan.AlcanderCan laugh alike at prophecy and prophet.He soars, officious babler, 'bove thy sphere,And the vain boy thou boast'st of: but go on;In blind security go dreaming on,Into the pit destruction digs.Exit.Iol.He's gone:A deep, determined villain, who would wadeThro' all the blood of all the royal race,T' usurp the throne of Argos. But oh, never,All-gracious Jove! let such a traitor wearThy own Alcides' crown. His black soul nowSits brooding over some new villainy.Alarming were his words—hold; let me ponder.[He retires.Enter DEIANIRA with an ATTENDANT.Atten.For worlds, my queen! for worlds, thou should'st not riskA second time such perils.

When the procession passed,At a small distance, I beheld the groveWith multitudes encircled; listening allTo hear the trumpet's signal, that devotedThe victim to the god. Along the vale,Broken, by fits, came floating on the airThe sound of solemn hymning; I beheldThe priest in purple vestment take his stand;I saw the sun beams glittering on his sword,Uplifted for the blow; I heard the trump:—Sudden 'twas all confusion!—Deia.Iolaus,Thou'st caught my fears: I read them in thy eyes,Alcander's ruffian band have crossed the rites—The populace call on the king to yield,Dread Jove! to yield my child!—But no; the ties,The sacred ties of friendship, of relation,He better knows—the debt of gratitudeHe owes Alcides, deeply is engraved,And to his race he'll pay it. Rest, poor heart!Safe in that hope—safe in his pietyTo heaven!—the best religion to the godsIs mercy to mankind.Haem.The king's thy shield;And every shaft the tyrant shoots shall backReturn to his own breast.Deia.It may be so.—But yet, but yet this horrible suspenseThe worst of apprehensions conjures up,In their worst forms—All dark where-e'er I turn!And dismal all!—on a lone rock I stand,The wild waves raving round me!Iol.Yet awhile,A little while endure—the thunder's o'er;And now the scattering rack flies harmless on.Deia.My heart will bear no more! I'll to the grove:Yet, to break in unbid!—a moment's pause—What, if I enter here; in Juno's temple,Try to propitiate the incensed power,And make her less my foe? I'll enter here;And try to deprecate her wrath.

In these our days, when men their object miss,There are who like to hear the serpent hiss.One thing there is, which I must not disguise;Tho' brave, heroic, generous, and wise,The lover, tam'd, aside his club could throw,Chain'd to the distaff, like a modern beau.Yet, all his toils and all his labours past,By death ev'n Envy was subdued at last.We read, (so says our bard) in Ovid's stileHow for himself he rais'd the funeral pile.There on his club reclining,—like a guestWith garlands crown'd—he sunk to endless rest.Yet even now, in these degenerate days,Heroic virtue still can merit praise.When round the ship, in the deep roaring tide,Devouring flames advance on ev'ry side;Lo! on the anchor where the hero lies,With look serene, and still the foe defies,He views the flame, he views the brawling wave,Then sinks—undaunted sinks in glory's grave.May his example every breast inspire,And kindle thro' the land our antient fire.For nought,—as Shakespeare sings, "can make us rue"If Britain to herself will prove but true."THE END.
