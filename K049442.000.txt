THE Fifteen COMFORTS OF A Scotch-Man. Written by Daniel D' Foe in Scotland.LONDON: Printed in the Year, MDCCVII.THE Fifteen Comforts, &c.The First Comfort.BE Dumb ye Beggars of the Rhiming TradeGeld the ose Wits, and let the Muse be SplaidCharge not the Parish with the Bastard PhraseOf Balm, Elixar, both the India's,Of Shrine, Saint, Sacriledge, and such as theseExpressions, common as their Mistresses.Of her I write, no Pen can reach her Worth,Nor find an Epithet to set her forth;I mean Heroick Anne, our Gracious Queen,In War Victorious, and in Pomp Serene;The Circle of whose Reign contains all Bliss,And daily studies Scotland's Happiness.The Second Comfort.Now Sacred Anne does wear the British Crown,The Church does flourish, and is lofty grown;The Laws are risen from a long, long Trance,And our uniting is a Check to France;
Which Union even would make our Foes BaptizeThemselves all Converts in our watry Eyes;Which we for very Joy do weep, to seeHow Anne designs to make Posterityor ever happy, whilst She's on the Throne,n making Scots and English both as One.The Third ComfortAmong the num'rous Throng, we Scots do come,To wish the grand Support of ChristendomHealth, that's the Joy of Life, and Soul of Mirth,Bane of  and Comfort of our Birth:May't with your Years, as clearly last and rise,As 'twas e'er Winds had blasted Paradise!Wealth! the Support of Pleasure and the Crown,The only Prop of Glory and Renown.May the same virtuous Temper, the same Fire,That never flags too low, nor do's mount higher,Enflame your Breast, and to't by Heaven be sentThat which all seek (but find not) true Content.May all your Aims atchieve their purpos'd End,Then Loyal Scotland ne'er will want a Friend,To be the Guardian of their Church and State,Whilst the Rose and Thistle do incorporate.The Fourth Comfort.Poor lousie, beggar'd France, & half-starv'd Spain,Durst not presume t' appear upon the Main;For now St. Andrew, and St. George do joyn,Upon the Ocean they'll in Glory shine.
Whose Union-Colours on the rolling Sea,Will shew the Force of British Heraldry:Thus on that Element the Scots too FameWill get, and to tho encient Scottish NameWill Honour add, by having such a FleetThat durst our Foe upon the Ocean meet,And make them low'r their Top-sails too at Sea,As owning that the only SovereigntyThereof is Sacred Anna's Lawful Right,For which Her Loyal Subjects too will Fight.The Fifth Comfort.In a Protestant Succession now the CrownIs fix'd, and none must mount the British Throne,But what will the reformed Faith defend,And to the Church of England be a Friend;For by her Grandeur we supported be,Whilst Conscience do's enjoy its Liberty.And that which also gives our Hearts Content,As that two Nations has one Parliament.The Sixth Comfort.As to our Comforts what can more be said?Freedom we have, and Intercourse of Trade,To any Port or Place the Kingdom round;Besides, all Scottish Ships that shall be found,At Signing of this Treaty, on the Sea,Of any sort of Foreign Built, shall beAs Ships of the Built of Great-Britain deem'd:So much is Scotland by the Queen esteem'd,That Her Indulgence makes us all conspireTo act, and to comply with Her Desire.The Seventh Comfort.Now, now, old Scotland is for ever made,Since (with the English) in the way of Trade,We have the same Allowances, Restitutions,Lawful Encouragements, and Prohibitions.No Article the Loyal Scots do blame,For Excise with us, as you, is all the same;For seven Years we shall be Duty-freeIn making Salt; and farthermore we see,The Land-Tax will be very easie here,The Yoak is light for any one to bear.The Eighth Comfort.Duties on Paper Stamp'd we shall not pay,Nor Duties which they do on Velome lay;And farther to confirm us in our Rights,We shall no Duty pay for Window-Lights;Nay, Royal Favours still are more enlarg'd,For Coals consum'd at Home we shan't be charg'd,Nor charg'd with any Duty laid on Malt,So if we won't unite, 'tis all our Fault:Both Nations will be one, and we shall beTo all Intents as Englishmen (Sir) free;All Animosities being laid aside,In Love and Unity we shall take Pride,And in Eternal Friendship so disposeOur selves, as to be dreadful to our Foes.The Ninth Comfort.One British Parliament will now be made,And we have an Equivalent in Trade:
The Coin of the united Kingdoms tooBe all alike, that all may have their Due:Our Weights and Measures too must be the same,That People may not diff'rent Measures b lame.The Tenth Comfort.The Laws concerning regulating Trade,In favour of our Constitution's made;The Court of Sessions must the same remainAs formerly, in this the present Reign;All Misdemeanours done upon the Sea,To be subject to the British Admiralty.Nay, further to encrease our Happiness,Men Offices for Life may still possess;And yet to make us happy o'er again,The Queen is pleas'd, that all the Rights remainOf Royal Scottish Burroughs, as they nowAt present are: What more can She allow?Or we from Royal Bounty still require,Since we have all as Subjects can desire.The Eleventh Comfort.We shall have Lords and Commons too to sitIn Parliament, where're the Queen thinks fit,Who will have all the Priviledges too,That's really to their noble Peerage due;The same as English Peers they will enjoy,Which Treaty will the Hopes of France destroyAnd that in time we may our Breaches heal,Great-Britain must but use one only Seal,Quartered with those Arms as best may sure,This Union, which makes ANNA absolute,
Empress Imperial over the Bless'd Realm,Of which She does so wisely rule the Helm.The Twelfth Comfort.All Laws and Statutes in each Realm, so farAs to the Union they contrary are,From and after it they cease, and shall be void,That Liberty by us may be enjoy'd.What can we then of England ask for more,No greater Blessings they can have in store,Than what are granted, so let's all sit down,And drink the Health of Anne, who wears the Crown,And wish Her long to Reign, that She may beA Terror to the Gallick Monarchy.The Thirteenth Comfort.The Scottish Parliament has done their best,That these two Kingdoms may be doubly blest;Upon the English Parliament we wait,With low Submission for to know our Fate,Hoping kind Heav'n will cause them to agreeTo this long wish'd and hop'd for Unity,Which surely will prove of such Consequence,That it will be a Thorn i' th' side of France,And make them rue the Day that e'er we cameTo be a People of one Crown, and Name:For our uniting makes the Frenchmen fear,Some dreadful Storm's to them approaching near.The Fourteenth Comfort.Now, now, the Scots with England do unite,Lewis and Maintenon are in a Fright;Ye Spaniards too, your drooping Kingdom drenchTill Tears the Flames of Purgatory quench:But you that can't cry, yet would seem to weepYour Hankerchiefs in Holy Water steep,Then Virgin Mary, and the Saints invoke,To keep your Kingdom from the Frenchmen YokeBut if ye'll still be Fools, and will not ownKing Charles, by Force we'll put on him a CrownThe Fifteenth Comfort.Glory and Honour Crown great Anna's NAnd let her Greatness shine with endless FamFor making such an Union that shall shakeProud France, and make its haughty Mon quaSo whilst we Praises to our Sovereign give,Let's pray that Anne a Nestor's Age may liveFINIS.
