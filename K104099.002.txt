THE PROGRESS of LOVE. IN Four ECLOGUES.UNCERTAINTY. ECLOGUE I. To Mr. POPE.POPE, to whose reed beneath the beechen shade,The Nymphs of Thames a pleas'd attention paid;While yet thy Muse, content with humbler praise,Warbled in Windsor's grove her sylvan lays,Though now sublimely borne on Homer's wing,Of glorious wars, and godlike chiefs she sing:Wilt thou with me re-visit once againThe crystal fountain, and the flow'ry plain?Wilt thou, indulgent, hear my verse relateThe various changes of a lover's state;And while each turn of passion I pursue,Ask thy own heart if what I tell be true?To the green margin of a lonely wood,Whose pendent shades o'erlook'd a silver flood,Young Damon came, unknowing where he stray'd,Full of the image of his beauteous maid:His flock far off, unfed, untended lay,To ev'ry savage a defenceless prey;No sense of int'rest could their master move,And ev'ry care seem'd trifling now but Love.Awhile in pensive silence he remain'd,But tho' his voice was mute his looks complain'd;At length the thoughts within his bosom pent,Forc'd his unwilling tongue to give them vent.Ye Nymphs, he cry'd, ye Dryads, who so longHave favour'd Damon, and inspir'd his song;For whom, retir'd, I shun the gay resortsOf sportful cities, and of pompous courts;In vain I bid the restless world adieu,To seek tranquillity and peace with you.Tho' wild Ambition and destructive Rage,No Factions here can form, no Wars can wage;Tho' Envy frowns not on your humble shades,Nor Calumny your innocence invades,Yet cruel Love, that troubler of the breast,Too often violates your boasted rest;With inbred storms disturb your calm retreat,And taints with bitterness each rural sweet.Ah luckless day! when first with fond surprizeOn Delia's face I fix'd my eager eyes;Then in wild tumults all my soul was tost:Then reason, liberty, at once were lost:And ev'ry wish, and thought, and care was gone,But what my heart employ'd on her alone.Then too she smil'd: can smiles our peace destroy,Those lovely children of Content and Joy?How can soft pleasure and tormenting woe,From the same spring at the same moment flow?Unhappy boy, these vain enquiries cease,Thought could not guard, nor will restore thy peace:Indulge the frenzy that thou must endure,And sooth the pain thou know'st not how to cure.Come, flatt'ring Memory, and tell my heartHow kind she was, and with what pleasing artShe strove its fondest wishes to obtain,Confirm her pow'r, and faster bind my chain.If on the green we danc'd, a mirthful band,To me alone she gave her willing hand;Her partial taste, if e'er I touch'd the lyre,Still in my song found something to admire.By none but her my crook with flow'rs was crown'd,By none but her my brows with ivy bound:The world that Damon was her choice believ'd,The world, alas! like Damon, was deceiv'd!When last I saw her, and declar'd my fireIn words as soft as passion cou'd inspire,Coldly she heard, and full of scorn withdrew,Without one pitying glance, or sweet adieu.The frighted hind, who sees his ripen'd cornUp from the roots by sudden tempests torn,Whose fairest hopes destroy'd and blasted lie,Feels not so keen a pang of grief as I.Ah, how have I deserv'd, inhuman maid,To have my faithful service thus repay'd?Were all the marks of kindness I receiv'd,But dreams of joy, that charm'd me and deceiv'd?Or did you only nurse my growing love,That with more pain I might your hatred prove?Sure guilty treachery no place cou'd findIn such a gentle, such a gen'rous mind:A maid brought up the woods and wilds among,Could ne'er have learnt the art of courts so young:No; let me rather think her anger feign'd,Still let me hope my Delia may be gain'd;'Twas only modesty that seem'd disdain,And her heart suffer'd when she gave me pain.Pleas'd with this flatt'ring thought the love-sick boyFelt the faint dawnings of a doubtful joy;Back to his flock more cheerful he return'd,When now the setting sun less fiercely burn'd:Blue vapours rose along the mazy rills,And light's last blushes ting'd the distant hills.HOPE. ECLOGUE II. To Mr. DODDINGTON.HEar, DODDINGTON, the notes that shepherds sing,Notes soft as those of nightingales in spring:Nor Pan, nor Phoebus tune the shepherd's reed:From Love alone our tender lays proceed:Love warms our fancy with enliv'ning fires,Refines our genius, and our verse inspires:From him Theocritus, on Enna's plains,Learnt the wild sweetness of his Doric strains;Virgil by him was taught the moving art,That charm'd each ear, and soften'd ev'ry heart:O would'st thou quit the pride of courts, and deignTo dwell with us upon the vocal plain,Thee too his pow'r should reach, and ev'ry shadeResound the praises of thy fav'rite maid;Thy pipe our rural concert wou'd improve,And we should learn of thee to please and love.Damon no longer sought the silent shade,No more in unfrequented paths he stray'd,But call'd the nymphs to hear his jocund song,And told his joy to all the rustic throng.Blest be the hour, he said, that happy hour▪When first I own'd my Delia's gentle pow'r;Then gloomy Discontent and pining CareForsook my breast, and left soft wishes there:Soft wishes there they left, and gay desires,Delightful languors, and transporting fires.Where yonder limes combine to form a shade,These eyes first gaz'd upon the charming maid;There she appear'd, on that auspicious day,When swains their sportive rites to Bacchus pay:She led the dance—heav'ns! with what grace she mov'd!Who cou'd have seen her then, and not have lov'd?I strove not to resist so sweet a flame,But glory'd in a happy captive's name;Nor wou'd I now, cou'd Love permit, be free,But leave to brutes their savage liberty.And art thou then, fond swain, secure of joy?Can no reverse thy flattering bliss destroy?Has treach'rous Love no torment yet in store?Or hast thou never prov'd his fatal pow'r?Whence flow'd those tears that late bedew'd thy cheek?Why sigh'd thy heart as if it strove to break?Why were the desart rocks invok'd to hearThe plaintive accents of thy sad despair?From Delia's rigour all those pains arose,Delia, who now compassionates my woes,Who bids me hope; and in that charming wordHas peace and transport to my soul restor'd.Begin, my pipe, begin the gladsome lay;A kiss from Delia shall thy musick pay;A kiss obtain'd 'twixt struggling and consent,Giv'n with forc'd anger, and disguis'd content:No laureat wreaths I ask to bind my brows,Such as the Muse on lofy bards bestows;Let other swains to praise or fame aspire:I from her lips my recompence require.Hark how the bees with murmurs fill the plain,While ev'ry flow'r of ev'ry sweet they drain:See, how beneath yon hillock's shady steep,The shelter'd herds on flow'ry couches sleep;Nor bees, nor herds, are half so blest as I,If with my fond desires my Love comply:From Delia's lips a sweeter honey flows,And on her bosom dwells more soft repose.Ah how, my dear, shall I deserve thy charms?What gift can bribe thee to my longing arms?A bird for thee in silken bands I hold,Whose yellow plumage shines like polish'd gold;From distant isles the lovely stranger came,And bears the Fortunate Canaries name;In all our woods none boasts so sweet a note,Not even the nightingale's melodious throat.Accept of this; and cou'd I add besideWhat wealth the rich Peruvian mountains hide;If all the gems in Eastern rocks were mine,On thee alone their glitt'ring pride shou'd shine.But if thy mind no gifts have pow'r to move,Phoebus himself shall leave th' Aonian grove;The tuneful Nine, who never sue in vain,Shall come sweet suppliants for their fav'rite swain.For him each blue-ey'd Naiad of the flood,For him each green-hair'd sister of the wood,Whom oft beneath fair Cynthia's gentle rayHis musick calls to dance the night away.And you, fair nymphs, companions of my Love;With whom she joys the cowslip meads to rove,I beg you recommend my faithful flame,And let her often hear her shepherd's name;Shade all my faults from her enquiring sight,And shew my merits in the fairest light;My pipe your kind assistance shall repay,And ev'ry friend shall claim a diff'rent lay.But see! in yonder glade the heav'nly fairEnjoys the fragrance of the breezy air—Ah, thither let me fly with eager feet;Adieu, my pipe, I go my Love to meet—O may I find her as we parted last,And may each future hour be like the past!So shall the whitest lamb these pastures feed,Propitious Venus, on thy altars bleed.JEALOUSY. ECLOGUE III. To Mr. EDWARD WALPOLE.THE gods, O WALPOLE, give no bliss sincere:Wealth is disturb'd by care, and pow'r by fear.Of all the passions that employ the mind,In gentle Love the sweetest joys we find;Yet e'en those joys dire Jealousy molests,And blackens each fair image in our breasts.O may the warmth of thy too tender heartNe'er feel the sharpness of his venom'd dart;For thy own quiet think thy mistress just,And wisely take thy happiness on trust.Begin, my Muse, and Damon's woes rehearse,In wildest numbers and disorder'd verse.On a romantick mountain's airy head(While browzing goats at ease around him fed)Anxious he lay, with jealous cares oppress'd;Distrust and anger lab'ring in his breast—The vale beneath a pleasing prospect yields,Of verdant meads and cultivated fields;Through these a river rolls its winding flood,Adorn'd with various tufts of rising wood;Here half conceal'd in trees a cottage stands,A castle there the op'ning plain commands,Beyond, a town with glitt'ring spires is crown'd,And distant hills the wide horizon bound:So charming was the scene, awhile the swainBeheld delighted, and forgot his pain;But soon the stings infix'd within his heart,With cruel force renew'd their raging smart:His flow'ry wreath, which long with pride he wore,The gift of Delia, from his brows he tore:Then cry'd; May all thy charms, ungrateful maid,Like these neglected roses droop and fade;May angry Heav'n deform each guilty grace,That triumphs now in that deluding face;Those alter'd looks may ev'ry shepherd fly,And ev'n thy Daphnis hate thee worse than I.Say, thou inconstant, what has Damon done,To lose the heart his tedious pains had won;Tell me what charms you in my rival find,Against whose pow'r no ties have strength to bind;Has he, like me, with long obedience stroveTo conquer your disdain, and merit love?Has he with transport ev'ry smile ador'd,And dy'd with grief at each ungentle word?Ah, no! the conquest was obtain'd with ease:He pleas'd you, by not studying to please:His careless indolence your pride alarm'd;And had he lov'd you more, he less had charm'd.O pain to think, another shall possessThose balmy lips which I was wont to press:Another on her panting breast shall lie,And catch sweet madness from her swimming eye!—I saw their friendly flocks together feed,I saw them hand in hand walk o'er the mead;Wou'd my clos'd eyes had sunk in endless night,Ere I was doom'd to bear that hateful sight!Where-e'er they pass'd, be blasted every flow'r,And hungry wolves their helpless flocks devour.—Ah wretched swain, could no examples moveThy heedless heart to shun the rage of love?Hast thou not hear'd how poor See Mr. GAY'S Dione. Menalcas dy'dA victim to Parthenia's fatal pride?Dear was the youth to all the tuneful plain,Lov'd by the nymphs, by Phoebus lov'd in vain:Around his tomb their tears the Muses paid,And all things mourn'd but the relentless maid.Wou'd I cou'd die like him and be at peace,These torments in the quiet grave would cease;There my vext thoughts a calm repose wou'd find.And rest as if my Delia still were kind.No, let me live her falshood to upbraid;Some god perhaps my just revenge will aid.—Alas what aid, fond swain, would'st thou receive?Cou'd thy heart bear to see its Delia grieve?Protect her, Heav'n, and let her never knowThe slightest part of hapless Damon's woe:I ask no vengeance from the pow'rs above;All I implore is never more to love—Let me this fondness from my bosom tear,Let me forget that e'er I thought her fair.Come, cool Indifference, and heal my breast;Wearied, at length, I seek thy downy rest:No turbulence of passion shall destroyMy future ease with flatt'ring hopes of joy.Hear, mighty Pan, and all ye Sylvans hear,What by your guardian deities I swear;No more my eyes shall view her fatal charms,No more I'll court the trayt'ress to my arms;Not all her arts my steady soul shall move,And she shall find that Reason conquers Love.—Scarce had he spoke, when through the lawn belowAlone he saw the beauteous Delia go;At once transported he forgot his vow,(Such perjuries the laughing gods allow)Down the steep hills with ardent haste he flew;He found her kind, and soon believ'd her true.POSSESSION. ECLOGUE IV. To the Lord COBHAM.COBHAM, to thee this rural lay I bring,Whose guiding judgment gives me skill to sing;Though far unequal to those polish'd strains,With which thy Congreve charm'd the list'ning plains,Yet shall its musick please the partial ear,And sooth thy breast with thoughts that once were dear;Recall those years which time has thrown behind,When smiling Love with Honour shar'd thy mind:The sweet remembrance shall thy youth restore,Fancy again shall run past pleasures o'er,And while in Stowe's enchanting walks you stray,This theme may help to cheat the summer's day.Beneath the covert of a myrtle wood,To Venus rais'd a rustick altar stood,To Venus and to Hymen, there combin'd,In friendly league to favour humankind.With wanton Cupids in that happy shade,The gentle Virtues, and mild Wisdom play'd.Nor there in sprightly Pleasure's genial train,Lurk'd sick Disgust, or late repenting Pain,Nor Force, nor Int'rest, join'd unwilling hands,But Love consenting ty'd the blissful bands.Thither with glad devotion Damon came,To thank the pow'rs who bless'd his faithful flame;Two milk-white doves he on their altar laid,And thus to both his grateful homage paid:Hail, bounteous god, before whose hallow'd shrineMy Delia vow'd to be for ever mine,While glowing in her cheeks, with tender love,Sweet virgin modesty reluctant strove:And hail to thee, fair queen of young desires,Long shall my heart preserve thy pleasing fires,Since Delia now can all its warmth return,As fondly languish, and as fiercely burn.O the dear gloom of last propitious night!O shade more charming than the fairest light!Then in my arms I clasp'd the melting maid,Then all my pains one moment overpaid;Then first the sweet excess of bliss I prov'd,Which none can taste but who like me have lov'd,Thou too, bright goddess, once in Ida's grove,Didst not disdain to meet a shepherd's love,With him while frisking lambs around you play'd,Conceal'd you sported in the secret shade;Scarce cou'd Anchises' raptures equal mine,And Delia's beauties only yield to thine.What are you now, my once most valu'd joys,Insipid trifles all, and childish toys—Friendship itself ne'er knew a charm like this,Nor Colin's talk could please like Delia's kiss.Ye Muses, skill'd in ev'ry winning art,Teach me more deeply to engage her heart;Ye Nymphs, to her your freshest roses bring,And crown her with the pride of all the spring;On all her days let health and peace attend;May she ne'er want, nor ever lose a friend;May some new pleasure ev'ry hour employ;But let her Damon be her highest joy.With thee, my Love, for ever will I stay,All night caress thee, and admire all day;In the same field our mingled flocks we'll feed,To the same spring our thirsty heifers lead,Together will we share the harvest toils,Together press the vine's autumnal spoils,Delightful state, where peace and love combine,To bid our tranquil days unclouded shine!Here limpid fountains roll through flow'ry meads,Here rising forests lift their verdant heads;Here let me wear my careless life away,And in thy arms insensibly decay.When late old age our heads shall silver o'er,And our slow pulses dance with joy no more;When time no longer will thy beauties spare,And only Damon's eye shall think thee fair;Then may the gentle hand of welcome death,At one soft stroke deprive us both of breath;May we beneath one common stone be laid,And the same cypress both our ashes shade.Perhaps some friendly Muse, in tender verse,Shall deign our faithful passion to rehearse,And future ages with just envy mov'd,Be told how Damon and his Delia lov'd.SOLILOQUY Of a BEAUTY in the COUNTRY. Written at ETON School.By the Same.'TWAS night; and FLAVIA to her room retir'd,With ev'ning chat and sober reading tir'd;There melancholy, pensive, and alone,She meditates on the forsaken town:On her rais'd arm reclin'd her drooping head,She sigh'd, and thus in plaintive accents said:"Ah, what avails it to be young and fair,"To move with negligence, to dress with care?"What worth have all the charms our pride can boast,"If all in envious solitude are lost?"Where none admire, 'tis useless to excel;"Where none are Beaus, 'tis vain to be a Belle:"Beauty, like wit, to judges should be shewn;"Both most are valu'd where they best are known."With ev'ry grace of nature, or of art,"We cannot break one stubborn country heart:"The brutes, insensible, our pow'r defy:"To love exceeds a 'Squire's capacity."The town, the court, is Beauty's proper sphere;"That is our heav'n, and we are angels There:"In that gay circle thousand Cupids rove,"The court of Britain is the court of Love."How has my conscious heart with triumph glow'd,"How have my sparkling eyes their transport shew'd,"At each distinguish'd birth-night ball, to see"The homage due to empire, paid to me!"When ev'ry eye was fix'd on me alone,"And dreaded mine more than the monarch's frown:"When rival statesmen for my favour strove,"Less jealous in their pow'r, than in their love."Chang'd is the scene; and all my glories die,"Like flow'rs transplanted to a colder sky;"Lost is the dear delight of giving pain,"The tyrant joy of hearing slaves complain."In stupid indolence my life is spent,"Supinely calm, and dully innocent:"Unblest I wear my useless time away;"Sleep (wretched maid!) all night, and dream all day;"Go at set hours to dinner and to prayer;"For dulness ever must be regular."Now with mamma at tedious whist I play;"Now without scandal drink insipid tea;"Or in the garden breathe the country air,"Secure from meeting any Tempter there:"From books to work, from work to books I rove,"And am (alas!) at leisure to improve!"Is this the life a Beauty ought to lead?"Were eyes so radiant only made to read?"These fingers, at whose touch ev'n age wou'd glow,"Are these of use for nothing but to sew?"Sure erring Nature never could design"To form a housewife in a mould like mine!"O Venus, queen and guardian of the fair,"Attend propitious to thy vot'ry's pray'r:"Let me revisit the dear town again:"Let me be seen!—cou'd I that wish obtain,"All other wishes my own pow'r would gain.BLENHEIM. Written at the University of OXFORD in the Year 1727.By the Same.PARENT of arts, whose skilful hand first taughtThe tow'ring pile to rise, and form'd the planWith fair proportion; architect divine,Minerva, thee to my advent'rous lyreAssistant I invoke, the means to singBLENHEMIA, monument of British fame,Thy glorious work! for thou the lofty tow'rsDidst to his virtue raise, whom oft thy shieldIn peril guarded, and thy wisdom steer'dThrough all the storms of war.—Thee too I call,Thalia, sylvan Muse, who lov'st to roveAlong the shady paths and verdant bow'rsOf Woodstock's happy grove: there tuning sweetThy rural pipe, while all the Dryad trainAttentive listen; let thy warbling songPaint with melodious praise the pleasing scene,And equal these to Pindus' honour'd shades.When Europe freed, confess'd the saving pow'rOf MARLB'ROUGH'S hand; Britain who sent him forthChief of confed'rate hosts, to fight the causeOf Liberty and Justice, grateful rais'dThis palace sacred to her Leader's fame;A trophy of success; with spoils adorn'dOf conquer'd towns, and glorying in the nameOf that auspicious field, where CHURCHILL'S swordVanquish'd the might of Gallia, and chastis'dRebel Bavar.—Majestick in its strengthStands the proud dome, and speaks its great design.Hail happy Chief, whose valour could deserveReward so glorious! grateful nation hail,Who paid'st his service with so rich a meed!Which most shall I admire, which worthiest praise,The Hero or the People? Honour doubts,And weighs their virtues in an equal scale.Not thus Germania pays th' uncancell'd debtOf gratitude to us.—Blush, Caesar, blush,When thou behold'st these tow'rs, ingrate to theeA monument of shame. Canst thou forgetWhence they are nam'd, and what an English armDid for thy throne that day? But we disdainOr to upbraid, or imitate thy guilt.Steel thy obdurate heart against the senseOf obligation infinite, and know,Britain, like Heav'n, protects a thankless worldFor her own glory, nor expects reward.Pleas'd with the noble theme, her task the MusePursues untir'd, and through the palace rovesWith ever-new delight. The tap'stry richWith gold, and gay with all the beauteous paintOf various-colour'd silks, dispos'd with skill,Attracts her curious eye. Here Ister rollsHis purple wave; and there the Granic floodWith passing squadrons foams: here hardy GaulFlies from the sword of Britain; there to GreeceEffeminate Persia yields.—In arms oppos'dMARLB'ROUGH and ALEXANDER vie for fameWith glorious competition; equal bothIn valour and in fortune, but their praiseBe diff'rent, for with diff'rent views they fought;This to subdue, and that to free mankind.Now through the stately portals issuing forth,The Muse to softer glories turns and seeksThe woodland shade, delighted. Not the valeOf Tempé fam'd in song, or Ida's groveSuch beauty boasts. Amid the mazy gloomOf this romantick wilderness once stoodThe bow'r of Rosamonda, hapless fair,Sacred to grief and love: the crystal fountIn which she us'd to bathe her beauteous limbsStill warbling flows, pleas'd to reflect the faceOf SPENCER, lovely maid, when tir'd she fitsBeside its flow'ry brink, and views those charmsWhich only Rosamond could once excel.But see where flowing with a nobler stream,A limpid lake of purest waters rollsBeneath the wide-stretch'd arch, stupendous work,Through which the Danube might collected pourHis spacious urn! Silent awhile and smoothThe current glides, till with an headlong forceBroke and disorder'd, down the steep it fallsIn loud cascades; the silver-sparkling foamGlitters relucent in the dancing ray.In these retreats repos'd the mighty soulOf CHURCHILL, from the toils of war and state,Splendidly private, and the tranquil joyOf contemplation felt, while BLENHEIM'S domeTriumphal, ever in his mind renew'dThe mem'ry of his fame, and sooth'd his thoughtsWith pleasing record of his glorious deeds.So by the rage of faction, home recall'd,Lucullus, while he wag'd successful warAgainst the pride of Asia, and the pow'rOf Mithridates, whose aspiring mindNo losses could subdue, enrich'd with spoilsOf conquer'd nations, back return'd to Rome,And in magnificent retirement pastThe evening of his life.—But not alone,In the calm shades of honourable ease,Great MARLB'ROUGH peaceful dwelt: Indulgent heav'nGave a companion to his softer hours,With whom conversing, he forgot all changeOf fortune, or of taste, and in her mindFound greatness equal to his own, and lov'dHimself in her.—Thus each by each admir'd,In mutual honour, mutual fondness join'd:Like two fair stars with intermingled light,In friendly union they together shone,Aiding each other's brightness, till the cloudOf night eternal quench'd the beams of one.Thee CHURCHILL first the ruthless hand of deathTore from thy consort's side, and call'd thee henceTo the sublimer seats of joy and love;Where Fate again shall join her soul to thine,Who now, regardful of thy fame, erectsThe column to thy praise, and sooths her woeWith pious honours to thy sacred nameImmortal. Lo! where tow'ring on the heightOf yon aërial pillar proudly standsThy image, like a guardian god, sublime,And awes the subject plain: beneath his feet,The German eagles spread their wings, his handGrasps Victory, its slave. Such was the browMajestick, such thy martial port, when GaulFled from thy frown, and in the Danube soughtA refuge from thy sword.—There, where the fieldWas deepest stain'd with gore, on Hochstet's plain,The theatre of thy glory, once was rais'dA meaner trophy, by th' Imperial hand;Extorted gratitude; which now the rageOf Malice impotent, beseeming illA regal breast, has levell'd to the ground:Mean insult! this with better auspicesShall stand on British earth, to tell the worldHow MARLB'ROUGH fought, for whom, and how repay'dHis services. Nor shall the constant loveOf her who rais'd the monument be lostIn dark oblivion: That shall be the themeOf future bards in ages yet unborn,Inspir'd with Chaucer's fire, who in these grovesFirst tun'd the British harp, and little deem'dHis humble dwelling should the neighbour beOf BLENHEIM, house superb; to which the throngOf travellers approaching, shall not passHis roof unnoted, but respectful hailWith rev'rence due. Such honour does the MuseObtain her favourites.—But the noble pile(My theme) demands my voice.—O shade ador'd,MARLB'ROUGH! who now above the starry sphereDwell'st in the palaces of heav'n, enthron'dAmongst the demi-gods, deign to defendThis thy abode, while present here below,And sacred still to thy immortal fame,With tutelary care. Preserve it safeFrom Time's destroying hand, and cruel strokeOf factious Envy's more relentless rage.Here may, long ages hence, the British youth,When Honour calls them to the field of war,Behold the trophies which thy valour rais'd;The proud reward of thy successful toilsFor Europe's freedom, and Britannia's fame:That fir'd with gen'rous envy, they may dareTo emulate thy deeds.—So shall thy name,Dear to thy country, still inspire her sonsWith martial virtue: and to high attemptsExcite their arms, till other battles won,And nations sav'd, new Monuments require,And other BLENHEIMS shall adorn the land.TO THE Reverend Dr. AYSCOUGH at OXFORD. Written from PARIS in the Year 1728.By the Same.SAY, dearest friend, how roll thy hours away?What pleasing study cheats the tedious day?Dost thou the sacred volumes oft exploreOf wise Antiquity's immortal lore,Where virtue by the charms of wit refin'd,At once exalts and polishes the mind?How diff'rent from our modern guilty art,Which pleases only to corrupt the heart;Whose curs'd refinements odious Vice adorn,And teach to honour what we ought to scorn!Dost thou in sage Historians joy to seeHow Roman Greatness rose with Liberty;How the same hands that tyrants durst controul,Their empire stretch'd from Atlas to the Pole;Till wealth and conquest into slaves refin'dThe proud luxurious masters of mankind?Dost thou in letter'd Greece each charm admire,Each grace, each virtue Freedom could inspire;Yet in her troubled states see all the woesAnd all the crimes that giddy Faction knows;Till rent by parties, by Corruption sold,Or weakly careless, or too rashly bold,She sunk beneath a mitigated doom,The slave and tut'ress of protecting Rome?Does calm Philosophy her aid impart,To guide the passions, and to mend the heart?Taught by her precepts, hast thou learnt the endTo which alone the wise their studies bend;For which alone by nature were design'dThe pow'rs of thought—to benefit mankind?Not like a cloyster'd drone, to read and doze,In undeserving, undeserv'd repose;But reason's influence to diffuse; to clearTh' enlighten'd world of ev'ry gloomy fear;Dispel the mists of error, and unbindThose pedant chains that clog the freeborn mind,Happy who thus his leisure can employ!He knows the purest hours of tranquil joy;Nor vex'd with pangs that busier bosoms tear,Nor lost to social Virtue's pleasing care;Safe in the port, yet lab'ring to sustainThose who will float on the tempestuous main.So Locke the days of studious quiet spent;So Boyle in wisdom found divine content;So Cambray, worthy of a happier doom,The virtuous slave of Louis and of Rome.Good Dr. HOUGH. Wor'ster thus supports his drooping age,Far from court-flatt'ry, far from party rage;He, who in youth a tyrant's frown defy'd,Firm and intrepid on his country's side,Her boldest champion then, and now her mildest guide.O gen'rous warmth! O sanctity divine!To emulate his worth, my friend, be thine:Learn from his life the duties of the gown;Learn not to flatter, nor insult the crown;Nor basely servile court the guilty great,Nor raise the Church a rival to the State:To Error mild, to Vice alone severe,Seek not to spread the law of Love by Fear.The priest, who plagues the world, can never mend:No foe to Man was e'er to God a friend:Let reason and let virtue faith maintain,All force but theirs is impious, weak, and vain.Me other cares in other climes engage,Cares that become my birth, and suit my age;In various knowledge to improve my youth,And conquer Prejudice, worst foe to Truth;By foreign arts domestick faults to mend,Enlarge my notions, and my views extend;The useful science of the world to know,Which books can never teach, or pedants shew.A nation here I pity, and admire,Whom noblest sentiments of glory fire,Yet taught by custom's force, and bigot fear,To serve with pride, and boast the yoke they bear:Whose Nobles born to cringe, and to command,In courts a mean, in camps a gen'rous band;From each low tool of pow'r content receiveThose laws, their dreaded arms to Europe give.Whose people vain in want, in bondage blest,Though plunder'd, gay; industrious, though oppress'd;With happy follies rise above their fate,The jest and envy of each wiser state.Yet here the Muses deign'd awhile to sportIn the short sun-shine of a fav'ring court:Here Boileau strong in sense, and sharp in wit,Who from the ancients, like the ancients writ,Permission gain'd inferior vice to blame,By flatt'ring incense to his Master's fame.Here Moliere, first of comick wits, excell'dWhate'er Athenian theatres beheld;By keen, yet decent satire skill'd to please,With morals mirth uniting, strength with ease.Now charm'd, I hear the bold Corneille inspireHeroick thought with Shakespear's force and fire;Now sweet Racine with milder influence moveThe soften'd heart to Pity and to Love.With mingled pain and pleasure I surveyThe pompous works of arbitrary sway;Proud palaces, that drain'd the subject store,Rais'd on the ruins of th' oppress'd and poor;Where ev'n mute walls are taught to flatter state,And painted triumphs stile Ambition GREAT The victories of LOUIS XVI. painted in the galleries of Versailles..With more delight those pleasing shades I view,Where Condé from an envious court withdrew Chantilly.;Where, sick of glory, faction, pow'r and pride,(Sure judge how empty all, who all had try'd)Beneath his palms the weary Chief repos'd,And life's great scene in quiet Virtue clos'd.With shame that other fam'd retreat I seeAdorn'd by Art, disgrac'd by Luxury St. Cloud.;Where Orleans wasted ev'ry vacant hourIn the wild riot of unbounded pow'r.Where feverish Debauch and impious LoveStain'd the mad table and the guilty grove.With these amusements is thy friend detain'd,Pleas'd and instructed in a foreign land;Yet oft a tender wish recalls my mindFrom present joys to dearer left behind:O native isle, fair Freedom's happiest feat!At thought of thee my bounding pulses beat;At thought of thee my heart impatient burns,And all my country on my soul returns.When shall I see the fields, whose plenteous grainNo pow'r can ravish from th' industrious swain?When kiss with pious love the sacred earth,That gave a BURLEIGH, or a RUSSEL birth?When, in the shade of laws, that long have stood,Prop'd by their care, or strengthen'd by their blood,Of fearless independence wisely vain,The proudest slave of Bourbon's race disdain?Yet oh! what doubt, what sad presaging voiceWhispers within, and bids me not rejoice;Bids me contemplate ev'ry state around,From sultry Spain to Norway's icy bound;Bids their lost rights, their ruin'd glories see;And tells me, These, like England, once were Free.To Mr. POYNTZ, Ambassador at the Congress of SOISSONS, in the Year 1728. Written at PARIS.By the Same.O Thou whose friendship is my joy and pride,Whose virtues warm me, and whose precepts guide;Thou, to whom greatness rightly understood,Is but a larger power of being good;Say, Poyntz, amidst the toils of anxious state,Does not thy secret soul desire retreat?Dost thou not wish (the task of glory done)Thy busy life at length might be thy own;That to thy lov'd Philosophy resign'd,No care might ruffle thy unbended mind?Just is the wish. For sure the happy meed,To favour'd man by smiling heav'n decreed,Is to reflect at ease on glorious pains,And calmly to enjoy what Virtue gains.Not him I praise, who from the world retir'd,By no enliv'ning gen'rous passion fir'd,On flow'ry couches slumbers life away,And gently bids his active pow'rs decay;Who fears bright Glory's awful face to see;And shuns Renown as much as Infamy:But blest is he, who exercis'd in cares,To private Leisure publick Virtue bears;Who tranquil ends the race he nobly run,And decks Repose with trophies Labour won.Him Honour follows to the secret shade,And crowns propitious his declining head:In his retreats their harps the Muses string,For him in lays unbought spontaneous sing;Friendship and Truth on all his moments wait,Pleas'd with Retirement better than with State;And round the bow'r where humbly great he lies,Fair olives bloom, or verdant laurels rise.So when thy Country shall no more demandThe needful aid of thy sustaining hand;When Peace restor'd shall on her downy wingSecure Repose and careless Leisure bring;Then to the shades of learned ease retir'd,The world forgetting, by the world admir'd,Among thy books and friends, thou shalt possessContemplative and quiet happiness;Pleas'd to review a life in honour spent,And painful merit paid with sweet content.Yet though thy hours unclogg'd with sorrow roll,Tho' wisdom calm, and science feed thy soul;One dearer bliss remains to be possess'd,That only can improve and crown the rest—Permit thy friend this secret to reveal,Which thy own heart perhaps would better tell;The point to which our sweetest passions move;Is to be truly lov'd, and fondly love.This is the charm that sooths the troubled breast,Friend to our health, and author of our rest,Bids every gloomy vexing passion fly,And tunes each jarring string to harmony.Ev'n while I write; the name of Love inspiresMore pleasing thoughts, and more enliv'ning fires;Beneath his pow'r my raptur'd fancy glows,And ev'ry tender verse more sweetly flows.Dull is the privilege of living free;Our hearts were never form'd for Liberty:Some beauteous image well imprinted there,Can best defend them from consuming care.In vain to groves and gardens we retire,And nature in her rural works admire;Tho' grateful these, yet these but faintly charm,They may Delight us, but can never Warm.May some fair eyes, my friend, thy bosom fireWith pleasing pangs of ever gay desire;And teach thee that soft science, which aloneStill to thy searching mind rests slightly known.Thy soul, though great, is tender and refin'd,To friendship sensible, to love inclin'd;And therefore long thou canst not arm thy breastAgainst the entrance of so sweet a guest.Hear what th' inspiring Muses bid me tell,For Heav'n shall ratify what they reveal.A chosen bride shall in thy arms be plac'd,With all attractive charms of beauty grac'd;Whose wit and virtue shall thy own express,Distinguish'd only by their softer dress:Thy greatness she, or thy retreat shall share,Sweeten tranquillity, or soften care:Her smiles the taste of ev'ry joy shall raise,And add new pleasure to renown and praise;Till charm'd you own the truth my verse would prove,That Happiness is near allied to Love.VERSES to be written under a Picture of Mr. POYNTZ.By the Same.SUCH is thy form, O Poyntz! but who shall findA hand, or colours, to express thy mind?A mind unmov'd by ev'ry vulgar fear,In a false world that dares to be sincere;Wise without art; without ambition great;Tho' firm, yet pliant; active, tho' sedate;With all the richest stores of Learning fraught,Yet better still by native Prudence taught;That, fond the griefs of the distress'd to heal,Can pity frailties it could never feel;That, when Misfortune su'd, ne'er sought to knowWhat sect, what party, whether friend or foe;That, fix'd on equal Virtue's temp'rate laws,Despises calumny, and shuns applause;That, to its own perfections singly blind,Would for another think this praise design'd.An Epistle to Mr. POPE. From ROME, 1730.By the Same.IMmortal bard! for whom each Muse has woveThe fairest garlands of th' Aonian grove;Preserv'd, our drooping genius to restore,When Addison and Congreve are no more.After so many stars extinct in nightThe darken'd ages last remaining light!To thee from Latian realms this verse is writ,Inspir'd by memory of ancient wit;For now no more these climes their influence boast,Fall'n is their glory, and their virtue lost;From Tyrants and from Priests the Muses fly,Daughters of Reason and of Liberty:Nor Baioe now, nor Umbria's plain they love,Nor on the banks of Var, or Mincius rove;To Thames's flow'ry borders they retire,And kindle in thy breast the Roman fire.So in the shades, where cheer'd with summer raysMelodious linnets warbled sprightly lays,Soon as the faded, falling leaves complainOf gloomy Winter's unauspicious reign,No tuneful voice is heard of joy or love,But mournful silence saddens all the grove.Unhappy Italy! whose alter'd stateHas felt the worst severity of fate:Not that Barbarian hands her Fasces broke,And bow'd her haughty neck beneath their yoke;Not that her palaces to earth are thrown,Her cities desart, and her fields unsown;But that her ancient spirit is decay'd,That sacred Wisdom from her bounds is fled,That there the source of Science flows no more,Whence its rich streams supply'd the world before.Illustrious names! that once in Latium shin'd,Born to instruct and to command mankind;Chiefs, by whose virtue mighty Rome was rais'd,And Poets, who those Chiefs sublimely prais'd!Oft I the traces you have left explore,Your ashes visit, and your urns adore;Oft kiss, with lips devout, some mould'ring stone,With ivy's venerable shade o'ergrown;Those hallow'd ruins better pleas'd to seeThan all the pomp of modern luxury.As late on Virgil's tomb fresh flow'rs I strow'd,While with th' inspiring Muse my bosom glow'd,Crown'd with eternal bays my ravish'd eyesBeheld the poet's aweful form arise;Stranger, he said, whose pious hand has paidThese grateful rites to my attentive shade,When thou shalt breathe thy happy native air,To Pope this message from his Master bear:'Great Bard, whose numbers I myself inspire,To whom I gave my own harmonious lyre,If high exalted on the throne of Wit,Near me and Homer thou aspire to sit,No more let meaner Satire dim the raysThat flow majestick from thy nobler bays;In all the flow'ry paths of Pindus stray,But shun that thorny, that unpleasing way;Nor when each soft engaging Muse is thine,Address the least attractive of the Nine.Of thee more worthy were the task, to raiseA lasting column to thy Country's praise;To sing the land, which yet alone can boastThat Liberty corrupted Rome has lost;Where Science in the arms of Peace is laid,And plants her Palm beside the Olive's shade.Such was the theme for which my lyre I strung,Such was the people whose exploits I sung;Brave, yet refin'd, for arms and arts renown'd,With diff'rent bays by Mars and Phoebus crown'd;Dauntless opposers of tyrannick sway,But pleas'd a mild Augustus to obey.If these commands submissive thou receive,Immortal and unblam'd thy name shall live;Envy to black Cocytus shall retire,And howl with Furies in tormenting fire;Approving Time shall consecrate thy lays,And join the Patriot's to the Poet's praise.'To my LORD — In the Year 1730.

To be fair:For this the toilet ev'ry thought employs,Hence all the toils of dress, and all the joys:For this, hands, lips, and eyes are put to school▪And each instructive feature has its rule;And yet how few have learnt, when this is giv'n.Not to disgrace the partial boon of heav'n?How few with all their pride of form can move?How few are lovely, that were made for love?Do you, my fair, endeavour to possessAn elegance of mind as well as dress;Be that your ornament, and know to pleaseBy grateful Nature's unaffected ease.Nor make to dang'rous Wit a vain pretence,But wisely rest content with modest Sense;For wit, like wine, intoxicates the brain,Too strong for feeble women to sustain;Of those who claim it, more than half have none,And half of those who have it, are undone.Be still superior to your sex's arts,Nor think Dishonesty a proof of Parts;For you the plainest is the wisest rule,A CUNNING WOMAN is a KNAVISH FOOL.Be good yourself, nor think another's shameCan raise your merit, or adorn your fame.Prudes rail at whores, as statesmen in disgraceAt ministers, because they wish their place.Virtue is amiable, mild, serene,Without all beauty, and all peace within:The honour of a prude is rage and storm,'Tis ugliness in its most frightful form:Fiercely it stands defying gods and men,As fiery monsters guard a giant's den.Seek to be good, but aim not to be great:A woman's noblest station is Retreat;Her fairest virtues fly from publick sight,Domestick worth, that shuns too strong a light.To rougher man Ambition's task resign:'Tis ours in Senates or in Courts to shine,To labour for a sunk corrupted state,Or dare the rage of envy, and be great.One only care your gentle breasts should move,Th' important business of your life is Love:To this great point direct your constant aim,This makes your Happiness, and this your Fame.Be never cool reserve with passion join'd;With caution chuse; but then be fondly kind.The selfish heart, that but by halves is giv'n,Shall find no place in Love's delightful heav'n;Here sweet extremes alone can truly bless,The virtue of a lover is excess.A maid unask'd may own a well-plac'd flame,Not loving first, but loving wrong is shame.Contemn the little pride of giving pain,Nor think that conquest justifies disdain;Short is the period of insulting Pow'r;Offended Cupid finds his vengeful hour,Soon will resume the empire which he gave,And soon the Tyrant shall become the Slave.Blest is the maid, and worthy to be blest,Whose soul, entire by him she loves possess'd,Feels ev'ry vanity in fondness lost,And asks no pow'r, but that of pleasing most:Her's is the bliss in just return to proveThe honest warmth of undissembled Love;For her, inconstant man might cease to range,And Gratitude forbid Desire to change.But lest harsh Care the lover's peace destroy,And roughly blight the tender buds of joy,Let Reason teach what Passion fain would hide,That Hymen's bands by Prudence should be ty'd,Venus in vain the wedded pair would crown,If angry Fortune on their union frown:Soon will the flatt'ring dream of bliss be o'er,And cloy'd imagination cheat no more.Then waking to the sense of lasting pain,With mutual tears the nuptial couch they stain;And that fond love, which should afford relief,Does but increase the anguish of their grief;While both could easier their own sorrows bear,Than the sad knowledge of each other's care.Yet may you rather feel that virtuous pain,Than sell your violated charms for gain;Than wed the wretch whom you despise, or hate,For the vain glare of useless wealth or state.The most abandoned prostitutes are they,Who not to Love, but Av'rice fall a prey:Nor aught avails the specious name of WIFE;A maid so wedded, is a WHORE FOR LIFE.Ev'n in the happiest choice, where fav'ring Heav'nHas equal love, and easy fortune giv'n,Think not, the husband gain'd, that all is done;The prize of Happiness must still be won;And oft, the careless find it to their cost,The Lover in the Husband may be lost;The Graces might alone his heart allure;They and the Virtues meeting must secure.Let ev'n your Prudence wear the pleasing dressOf care for him, and anxious tenderness.From kind concern about his weal or woe,Let each domestick duty seem to flow;The HOUSHOLD SCEPTRE, if he bids you bear,Make it your pride his servant to appear;Endearing thus the common acts of life,The Mistress still shall charm him in the Wife;And wrinkled age shall unobserv'd come on,Before his eye perceives one beauty gone:Ev'n o'er your cold, and ever-sacred urn,His constant flame shall unextinguish'd burn.Thus I, Belinda, would your charms improve,And form your heart to all the arts of Love;The task were harder to secure my ownAgainst the pow'r of those already known;For well you twist the secret chains that bindWith gentle force the captivated mind,Skill'd ev'ry soft attraction to employ,Each flatt'ring hope, and each alluring joy;I own your genius, and from you receiveThe rules of Pleasing, which to you I give.SONG.

On her pleading want of TIME.I.ON Thames's bank, a gentle youthFor LUCY sigh'd with matchless truth,Ev'n when he sigh'd in rhyme;The lovely maid his flame return'd,And wou'd with equal warmth have burn'd,But that she had not Time.II.Oft he repair'd with eager feetIn secret shades this fair to meetBeneath th' accustom'd lyme;She would have fondly met him there,And heal'd with love each tender care,But that she had not Time.IV."It was not thus, inconstant maid,"You acted once (the shepherd said)"When love was in its prime:She griev'd to hear him thus complain,And would have writ to ease his pain,But that she had not Time.IV.How can you act so cold a part?No crime of mine has chang'd your heart,If Love be not a crime.—We soon must part for months, for years—She would have answer'd with her tears,But that she had not Time.To the Same.YOUR shape, your lips, your eyes are still the same,Still the bright object of my constant flame;But where is now the tender glance, that stoleWith gentle sweetness my enchanted soul?Kind fears, impatient wishes, soft desires,Each melting charm that love alone inspires,These, these are lost; and I behold no moreThe maid, my heart delighted to adore.Yet still unchang'd, still doating to excess,I ought but dare not try to love you less;Weakly I grieve, unpity'd I complain;But not unpunish'd shall your change remain;For you, cold maid, whom no complaints can move,Were far more blest, when you like me cou'd love.To the Same.I.WHEN I think on your truth, I doubt you no more,I blame all the fears I gave way to before,I say to my heart, "Be at rest, and believeThat whom once she has chosen she never will leave.II.But ah! when I think on each ravishing graceThat plays in the smiles of that heavenly face,My heart beats again; I again apprehendSome fortunate rival in every friend.III.These painful suspicions you cannot remove,Since you neither can lessen your charms nor my love;But doubts caus'd by passion you never can blame;For they are not ill founded, or you feel the same.To the same with a NEW WATCH.WITH me while present, may thy lovely eyesBe never turn'd upon this golden toy:Think ev'ry pleasing hour too swiftly flies,And measure time, by joy succeeding joy.But when the cares that interrupt our blissTo me not always will thy sight allow,Then oft with kind impatience look on this,Then every minute count—as I do now.An Irregular ODE written at Wickham, in 1746. To the Same.I.YE sylvan scenes with artless beauty gay,Ye gentle shades of Wickham say,What is the charm that each successive year,Which sees me with my LUCY here,Can thus to my transported heart,A sense of joy unfelt before impart?II.Is it glad Summer's balmy breath that blowsFrom the fair jess'mine, and the blushing rose?Her balmy breath, and all her blooming store,Of rural bliss was here before:Oft have I met her on the verdant sideOf Norwood-hill, and in the yellow meads,Where Pan the dancing Graces leads,Array'd in all her flow'ry pride.No sweeter fragrance now the gardens yield,No brighter colours paint th' enamel'd field.III.Is it to Love these new delights I owe?Four times has the revolving sunHis annual circle thro' the zodiac run;Since all that Love's indulgent pow'rOn favour'd mortals can bestow,Was giv'n to me in this auspicious bow'r.IV.Here first my LUCY, sweet in virgin charms,Was yielded to my longing arms;And round our nuptial bed,Hov'ring with purple wings, th' Idalian boyShook from his radiant torch the blissful firesOf innocent desires,While Venus scatter'd myrtles o'er her head.Whence then this strange increase of joy?He, only he can tell, who match'd like me,(If such another happy man there be)Has by his own experience try'dHow much the Wife is dearer than the Bride.To the MEMORY of the same LADY, A MONODY. A. D. 1747.Ipse cavâ solans aegrum testudine amorem,Te dulcis conjux, te solo in littore secum,Te veniente die, te decedente canebat.By the Same.I.AT length escap'd from ev'ry human eye,From ev'ry duty, ev'ry care,That in my mournful thoughts might claim a share,Or force my tears their flowing stream to dry,Beneath the gloom of this embow'ring shade,This lone retreat, for tender sorrow made,I now may give my burden'd heart relief,And pour forth all my stores of grief,Of grief surpassing ev'ry other woe,Far as the purest bliss, the happiest loveCan on th' ennobled mind bestow,Exceeds the vulgar joys that moveOur gross desires, inelegant, and low.II.Ye tufted groves, ye gently-falling rills,Ye high o'ershadowing hills,Ye lawns gay-smiling with eternal green,Oft have you my LUCY seen!But never shall you now behold her more:Nor will she now with fond delightAnd taste refin'd your rural charms explore.Clos'd are those beauteous eyes in endless night,Those beauteous eyes where beaming us'd to shineReason's pure light, and Virtue's spark divine.III.Oft would the Dryads of these woods rejoiceTo hear her heav'nly voice,For her despising, when she deign'd to sing,The sweetest songsters of the spring:The woodlark and the linnet pleas'd no more;The nightingale was mute,And ev'ry shepherd's fluteWas cast in silent scorn away,While all attended to her sweeter lay.Ye larks and linnets now resume your song,And thou, melodious Philomel,Again thy plaintive story tell.For death has stopt that tuneful tongue,Whose musick could alone your warbling notes excel.IV.In vain I look aroundO'er all the well-known groundMy LUCY'S wonted footsteps to descry;Where oft we us'd to walk,Where oft in tender talkWe saw the summer sun go down the sky;Nor by yon fountain's side,Nor where its waters glideAlong the valley, can she now be found:In all the wide-stretch'd prospect's ample boundNo more my mournful eyeCan aught of her espy,But the sad sacred earth where her dear relicks lie.V.O shades of H—y, where is now your boast?Your bright inhabitant is lost.You she preferr'd to all the gay resortsWhere female vanity might wish to shine,The pomp of cities, and the pride of courts.Her modest beauties shun'd the publick eye:To your sequester'd dalesAnd flow'r-embroider'd valesFrom an admiring world she chose to fly;With Nature there retir'd, and Nature's GOD,The silent paths of wisdom trod,And banish'd every passion from her breast,But those, the gentlest and the best,Whose holy flames with energy divineThe virtuous heat enliven and improve,The conjugal, and the maternal love.VI.Sweet babes, who, like the little playful fawns,Were wont to trip along these verdant lawnsBy your delighted Mother's side,Who now your infant steps shall guide?Ah! where is now the hand whose tender careTo ev'ry Virtue would have form'd your Youth,And strew'd with flow'rs the thorny ways of Truth?O loss beyond repair!O wretched Father left aloneTo weep their dire misfortune, and thy own!How shall thy weaken'd mind, oppress'd with woe,And drooping o'er thy LUCY'S grave,Perform the duties that you doubly owe,Now she, alas! is gone,From folly, and from vice, their helpless age to save?VII.Where were ye, Muses, when relentless FateFrom these fond arms your fair disciple tore,From these fond arms that vainly stroveWith hapless ineffectual LoveTo guard her bosom from the mortal blow?Could not your fav'ring power, Aonian maids,Could not, alas! your pow'r prolong her date,For whom so oft in these inspiring shades,Or under Campden's moss-clad mountains hoar,You open'd all your sacred store,Whate'er your ancient sages taught,Your ancient bards sublimely thought,And bade her raptur'd breast with all your spirit glow?VIII.Nor then did Pindus' or Castalia's plain,Or Aganippe's fount your steps detain,Nor in the Thespian vallies did you play;Nor then on The Mincio runs by Mantua, the birth-place of VIRGIL. Mincio's bankBeset with osiers dank,Nor where The Clitumnus is a river of Umbria, the residence of PROPERTIUS. Clitumnus rolls his gentle stream,Nor where through hanging woodsSteep The Anio runs through Tibur or Tivoli, where HORACE had a villa. Anio pours his floods,Nor yet where The Meles is a river of Ionia, from whence HOMER, supposed to be born on its banks, is called Melisigenes. Meles, or The Ilissus is a river at Athens. Ilissus stray,Ill does it now beseem,That, of your guardian care bereft,To dire disease and death your darling should be left.IX.Now what avails it that in early bloom,When light fantastic toysAre all her sex's joys,With you she search'd the wit of Greece and Rome?And all that in her latter daysTo emulate her ancient praiseItalia's happy genius could produce;Or what the Gallic fireBright-sparkling could inspire,By all the Graces temper'd and refin'd;Or what in Britain's isle,Most favour'd with your smile,The pow'rs of reason and of fancy join'dTo full perfection have conspir'd to raise?Ah what is now the useOf all these treasures that enrich'd her mind,To black oblivion's gloom for ever now consign'd?X.At least, ye Nine, her spotless name'Tis yours from death to save,And in the temple of immortal FameWith golden characters her worth engrave.Come then, ye virgin sisters, come,And strew with choicest flow'rs her hallow'd tomb.But foremost thou, in sable vestment clad,With accents sweet and sad,Thou, plaintive Muse, whom o'er his Laura's urnUnhappy Petrarch call'd to mourn,O come, and to this fairer Laura payA more impassion'd tear, a more pathetick lay.XI.Tell how each beauty of her mind and faceWas brighten'd by some sweet, peculiar grace!How eloquent in ev'ry lookThro' her expressive eyes her soul distinctly spoke!Tell how her manners by the world refin'dLeft all the taint of modish vice behind,And made each charm of polish'd courts agreeWith candid Truth's simplicity,And uncorrupted Innocence!Tell how to more than manly senseShe join'd the soft'ning influenceOf more than female tenderness:How in the thoughtless days of wealth and joy,Which oft the care of others' good destroy,Her kindly-melting heart,To ev'ry want, and ev'ry woe,To guilt itself when in distressThe balm of pity would impart,And all relief that bounty could bestow!Ev'n for the kid or lamb that pour'd its lifeBeneath the bloody knife,Her gentle tears would fall,Tears from sweet Virtue's source, benevolent to all.XII.Not only good and kind,But strong and elevated was her mind:A spirit that with noble prideCould look superior downOn Fortune's smile, or frown;That could without regret or painTo virtue's lowest duty sacrificeOr int'rest's or ambition's highest prize;That injur'd or offended never try'dIts dignity by vengeance to maintain,But by magnanimous disdain,A wit that temperately bright,With inoffensive lightAll pleasing shone, nor ever pastThe decent bounds that Wisdom's sober hand,And sweet Benevolence's mild command,And bashful Modesty before it cast.A prudence undeceiving, undeceiv'd,That nor too little, nor too much believ'd,That scorn'd unjust Suspicion's coward fear,And without weakness knew to be sincere.Such LUCY was, when in her fairest daysAmidst th' acclaim of universal praise,In life's and glory's freshest bloomDeath came remorseless on, and sunk her to the tomb.XIII.So where the silent streams of Liris glide,In the soft bosom of Campania's vale,When now the wintry tempests all are fled,And genial Summer breathes her gentle gale,The verdant orange lifts its beauteous head:From ev'ry branch the balmy flow'rets rise,On ev'ry bough the golden fruits are seen;With odours sweet it fills the smiling skies,The wood-nymphs tend it, and th' Idalian queen:But in the midst of all its blooming prideA sudden blast from Apenninus blows,Cold with perpetual snows:The tender blighted plant shrinks up its leaves, and dies.XIV.Arise, O Petrarch, from th' Elysian bowers,With never-fading myrtles twin'd,And fragrant with ambrosial flowers,Where to thy Laura thou again art join'd;Arise, and hither bring the silver lyre,Tun'd by thy skilful hand,To the soft notes of elegant desire,With which o'er many a landWas spread the same of thy disastrous love;To me resign the vocal shell,And teach my sorrows to relateTheir melancholy tale so well,As may ev'n things inanimate,Rough mountain oaks, and desart rocks, to pity move.XV.What were, alas! thy woes compar'd to mine?To thee thy mistress in the blissful bandOf Hymen never gave her hand;The joys of wedded love were never thine,In thy domestic careShe never bore a share,Nor with endearing artWould heal thy wounded heartOf ev'ry secret grief that fester'd there:Nor did her fond affection on the bedOf sickness watch thee, and thy languid headWhole nights on her unwearied arm sustain,And charm away the sense of pain:Nor did she crown your mutual flameWith pledges dear, and with a father's tender name.XVI.O best of wives! O dearer far to meThat when thy virgin charmsWere yielded to my arms,How can my soul endure the loss of thee?How in the world to me a desart grown,Abandon'd, and alone,Without my sweet companion can I live?Without thy lovely smile,The dear reward of ev'ry virtuous toil,What pleasures now can pall'd Ambition give?Ev'n the delightful sense of well-earn'd praise,Unshar'd by thee, no more my lifeless thoughts could raise,XVII.For my distracted mindWhat succour can I find?On whom for consolation shall I call?Support me ev'ry friend,Your kind assistance lendTo bear the weight of this oppressive woe.Alas! each friend of mine,My dear departed love, so much was thine,That none has any comfort to bestow.My books, the best reliefIn ev'ry other grief,Are now with your idea sadden'd all:Each fav'rite author we together readMy tortur'd mem'ry wounds, and speaks of LUCY dead.XVIII.We were the happiest pair of human kind!The rolling year its varying course perform'd,And back return'd again,Another and another smiling came,And saw our happiness unchang'd remain;Still in her golden chainHarmonious Concord did our wishes bind:Our studies, pleasures, taste, the same.O fatal, fatal stroke,That all this pleasing fabrick Love had rais'dOf rare felicity,On which ev'n wanton Vice with envy gaz'd,And ev'ry scheme of bliss our hearts had form'd,With soothing hope, for many a future day,In one sad moment broke!Yet, O my soul, thy rising murmurs stay,Nor dare th' all-wise Disposer to arraign,Or against his supreme decreeWith impious grief complain.That all thy full-blown joys at once should fadeWas his most righteous will, and be that will obey'd.XIX.Would thy fond love his grace to her controul,And in these low abodes of sin and painHer pure exalted soulUnjustly for thy partial good detain?No—rather strive thy grov'ling mind to raiseUp to that unclouded blaze,That heav'nly radiance of eternal light,In which enthron'd she now with pity seesHow frail, how insecure, how slightIs ev'ry mortal bliss,Ev'n love itself, if rising by degreesBeyond the bounds of this imperfect state,Whose fleeting joys so soon must end,It does not to its sov'reign Good ascend.Rise then, my soul, with hope elate,And seek those regions of serene delight,Whose peaceful path and ever open gateNo feet but those of harden'd Guilt shall miss.There Death himself thy LUCY shall restore,There yield up all his power e'er to divide you more.VERSES Making PART of an EPITAPH on the same LADY.By the Same.MADE to engage all hearts, and charm all eyes:Tho' meek, magnanimous; tho' witty, wise;Polite, as all her life in courts had been;Yet good, as she the world had never seen;The noble fire of an exalted mind,With gentle female tenderness combin'd.Her Speech was the melodious voice of Love,Her Song the warbling of the vernal Grove;Her Eloquence was sweeter than her Song,Soft as her Heart, and as her-Reason strong;Her Form each beauty of her mind express'd.Her Mind was Virtue by the Graces dress'd.ON THE ABUSE of TRAVELLING. A CANTO, In Imitation of SPENSER. By GILBERT WEST, EsqThe ARGUMENT.Archimage tempts the Red-Cross KnightFrom love of Fairy-land,With show of foreign pleasures all,The which he doth withstand.I.WISE was that Spartan Law-giver of old,Who rais'd on Virtue's base his well-built state,Exiling from her walls barbaric gold,With all the mischiefs that upon it wait,Corruption, luxury, and envious hate;And the distinctions proud of rich and poor,Which among brethren kindle foul debate,And teach Ambition, that to Fame would soar,To the false lure of wealth her stooping wing to low'r.II.Yet would Corruption soon have entrance found,And all his boasted schemes eftsoon decay'd,Had not he cast a pow'rful circle round,Which to a distance the arch felon fray'd,And ineffectual his foul engines made:This was, to weet, that politic command,Which from vain travel the young Spartan stay'd,Ne suffer'd him forsake his native land,To learn deceitful arts, and science contraband.III.Yet had the ancient world her courts and schools;Great Kings and Courtiers civil and refin'd;Great Rabbins, deeply read in Wisdom's rules,And all the arts that cultivate the mind,Embellish life, and polish human kind.Such, Asia, birth-place of proud monarchy,Such, elder Aegypt, in thy kingdoms shin'd,Mysterious Aegypt, the rank nurseryOf superstitions fond, and learned vanity.IV.But what accomplishments, what arts polite,Did the young Spartan want his deeds to grace,Whose manly virtues, and heroic spright,Check'd by no thought impure, no falsehood base,With nat'ral dignity might well out-faceThe glare of manners false, and mimic prideAnd wherefore should they range from place to place,Who to their country's love so firm were ty'd,All homely as she was, that for her oft they dy'd?V.And Truth. sooth it is (with rev'rence may ye hear,And honour due to passion so refin'd)The strong affection which true patriots bearTo their dear country, zealous is and blind,And fond as is the love of womankind,So that they may not her defects espy,No other rival, or one to compare with her. paragone may ever find,But gazing on her with an aweful eyeAnd superstitious zeal, her learn to deify.VI.And, like as is the faith unsound, untrue,Of him, who wand'ring aye from fair to fair,Conceiveth from each object passion new,Or from his heart quite drives the troublous care;So with the patriot-lover doth it fare,Who through the world delighting aye to rove,His country changeth with each change of air,Or weening the delights of all to prove,On none, or all alike bestows his vagrant love.VII.moreover, besides.Als doth corruption in a distant soil,With double force assault. assay the youthful heart,Expos'd suspectless to the traytor's wile,Expos'd unwarn'd to Pleasure's poison'd dart,Expos'd unpractis'd in the world's wide mart,Where each one lies, imposes, and betrays,Without a friend due counsel to impart,Without a parent's awe to rule his ways,Without the check of shame, or spur of public praiseVIII.therefore.Forthy, false Archimago, traytor vile,Who burnt 'gainst Fairy-land with ceaseless ire,'Gan cast with foreign pleasures to beguileHer faithful knight, and quench the heav'nly fireThat did his virtuous bosom aye inspireWith zeal unfeigned for her service true,And send him forth in chivalrous attire,Arm'd at all points adventures to pursue,And wreak upon her foes his vowed vengeance due.IX.So as he journeyed upon the way,Him soon the sly enchaunter overtook. over-hent,Clad like a Fairy knight in armour gay,With painted shield, and spear right forward bent,In knightly fashion. guise and shew of courage. hardiment,That aye prepared was for bloody fight.Whereat the fairy. Elfin knight with speeches gentHim first saluted, who, well as he might,Him fair salutes again, as beseemeth. seemeth courteous knight.X.Then 'gan he discourse, or argument. purpose frame of valiant deedsAtchiev'd by foreign knights of might, valour. prowess great,And mighty fame which emulation breedsIn virtuous breast, and kindleth martial heat;Of arts and sciences for warriour proper, fit. meet,And knights that would in feats of arms excel,Or him, who rather. liefer choosing calm retreat,With Peace and gentle Virtue aye would dwell,Who have their triumphs, like as hath Bellona fell.XI.These, as he said, beseemed knight to know,And all be they in Fairy-lond y-taught,Where ev'ry art and all fair virtues grow;Yet various climes with various fruits are fraught,And such in one hath full perfection reach'd. raughtThe which no skill may in another rear,So gloz'd th' enchaunter till he hath him broughtTo a huge rock, that clomb so high in air,That from it he hardly. uneath the murmuring surge mote hear.XII.Thence the salt wave beyond in prospect wideA spacious plain the false enchaunter show'd,With goodly castles deck'd on ev'ry side,And silver streams, that down the champain flow'd,And wash'd the vineyards that beside them stood,And groves of myrtle; als the lamp of dayHis orient beams display'd withouten cloud,Which lightly on the glist'ning waters play,And tinge the castles, woods, and hills with purple ray.XIII.So fair a landscape charm'd the wond'ring knight;And eke the breath of morning fresh and sweetInspir'd his jocund spirit with delight,And ease of heart for soft pursuasion meet.Then him the traytor base 'gan fair entreat,And from the rock as downward they descend,Of that blest lond his praises 'gan repeat,Till he him moved hath with him to to go. wend;So to the billowy shore their hasty march they bend.XIV.There in a painted bark all trim and gay,Whose sails full glad embrac'd the wanton wind,There sat a stranger man or woman. wight in quaint array,That seem'd of various garbs together. attone combin'd,Of Europe, Afric, east and western Inde.Als round about him many creatures stood,Of several nations and of divers kind,Apes, serpents, birds with human speech endow'd,And monsters of the land, and wonders of the flood.XV.He was to weet a mighty traveller,Who Curiosity thereafter was called. hight,And well he knew each coast and harbour fair,And ev'ry nation's latitude and site,And how to steer the wand'ring bark aright.So to him strait the false enchaunter bore,And with him likewise brought the red-cross knight.Then fairly him besought to waft them o'er;Swift flew the dauncing bark, and reach'd the adverse shore.XVI.There when they landed were, them ran to greetA bevy of bright damsels gent and gay,Who with soft smiles, and salutation sweet,And courteous violence would force them stay,And rest them in their bow'r not far away;Their bow'r that most luxuriously was adorned, set forth. dightWith all the dainties of air, earth and sea,All that mote please the taste, and charm the sight,The pleasure of the board, and charm of beauty bright.XVII.Als might he therein hear a mingled soundOf feast and song and laughing jollity,That in the noise was all distinction drown'dOf graver sense, or musick's harmony.Yet were there some in that blithe companyThat aptly could discourse of virtuous lore,Of manners, wisdom and sound policy;Yet would not. nould they often ope their sacred store,Ne might their voice be heard mid riot and uproar.XVIII.Thereto the joys of idleness and love,And luxury, that besots the noblest mind,And custom prevalent at distance droveAll sense and relish of a higher kind,Whereby the soul to virtue is refin'd.Instead whereof the arts of slaveryWere taught, of slavery perverse and blind,That vainly boasts her native liberty,Yet wears the chains of pride, of lust, and gluttony.XIX.Of which the red-cross knight right well aware,Would in no wise agree with them to go,Albeit with courtly glee their leader fair,called.Hight Politessa, him did kindly woo.But all was false pretence, and hollow show,False as the flow'rs which to their breasts they ty'd,Or those which seemed in their cheeks to glow,For both were false, and not by Nature dy'd,False rivals of the spring, and beauty's rosy pride.XX.Then from behind then straightway 'gan advanceAn uncouth stripling quaintly habited,As for some revel mask, or antick daunce,All chequer'd o'er with yellow, blue, and red;Als in a vizor black he shrouds his head,The which he tossed to and fro amain,And often. eft his lathy falchion brandished,As if he meant fierce battle to attempt. darrain,And like a wanton ape eft skip'd he on the plain.XXI.And eft about him skip'd a gaudy throngOf youthful gallants, frolick, trim, and gay,Chanting in careless notes their amourous song,Match'd with like careless gests, like amourous play.Als were they gorgeous, dress'd in rich array,And well accepted of that female train,Whose hearts to joy and mirth devoted aye,Each proffer'd love receive without disdain,And part without regret from each late-favour'd swain.XXII.And now they do accord in wanton daunceTo join their hands upon the flow'ry plain;The whiles with amourous leer and eyes askaunceEach damsel fires with love her glowing swain;Till all-impatient of the tickling pain,In sudden laughter forth at once they break,And ending so their daunce, each tender twainTo shady bow'rs forthwith themselves betake,Deep hid in myrtle groves, beside a silver lake.XXIII.Thereat the red-cross knight was much enmov'd,And 'gan his heart with indignation swell,To view in forms so made to be belov'd,Ne faith, ne truth, ne heav'nly virtue dwell;But lust instead, and falshood, child of hell;And glutton sloth, and love of gay attire:And sooth to say, them well could parallelTheir lusty lovers. paramours in vain desire;Well fitted to each dame was ev'ry gallant squire.XXIV.Yet when their sov'reign calls them forth to arms,Their sov'reign, whose commands. behests they most revere,Right wisely can they menage war's alarms,And wield with valour great the martial spear,So that their name is dreaded far and near.Oh! that for Liberty they so did fight!Then need no Fairy-land their prowess fear,Ne give in charge to her advent'rous knightTheir friendship to beware, and sense-deluding sleight.XXV.But not for liberty they wagen war,But solely to please. aggrate their mighty lord,For whom their dearest blood they will not. nillen spare,Whenso him listeth draw the conqu'ring sword;So is that idol vain of them ador'd,Who ne with might beyond his meanest thrallEndued, ne superior wisdom stor'd,Sees at his feet prostrated millions fall,And with religious drad obey his princely call.XXVI.Thereto so high and stately was his port,That all the petty kings him sore envy'd,And would him imitate in any sort,With all the mimick pageantry of pride,And worship'd be like him, and deify'dOf courtly sycophants and scoundrels. caitifs vile,Who to those services themselves apply'd,And in that school of servitude ere whileHad learn'd to bow and grin, and flatter, and beguile.XXVII.For to that seminary of fashions vainThe rich and noble from all parts repair,Where grown enamour'd of the gaudy train,And courteous haviour gent and debonair,They cast to imitate such semblaunce fair;And deeming meanly of their native lond,Their own rough virtues they disdain to wear,And back returning drest by foreign hond,Ne other matter care, ne other understond.XXVIII.Wherefore th' enchaunter vile, who sore was griev'dTo see the knight reject those damsels gay,Wherewith he thought him sure to have deceiv'd,Was minded to that court him to convey,And daze his eyen with Majesty's bright ray:So to a stately castle he him brought,Which in the midst of a great garden lay,And wisely was by cunning craftsmen wrought,And with all riches deck'd surpassing human thought.XXIX.There underneath a sumptuous canopy,That with bright ore and diamonds glitter'd far,Sate the swoln form of royal pride. surquedry,And deem'd itself by all means; omnino. allgates some creature rare,While its own haughty state it mote compareWith the base count'nance of the vassal fry,That seem'd to have nor eye, nor tongue, nor ear;Ne any sense, ne any faculty,That did not to his throne owe servile ministry.XXX.Yet wist he not that half that homage lowWas at a wizard's shrine in private pay'd,The which conducted all that goodly show,And as he list th' imperial puppet play'd,By secret springs and wheels right wisely made,That he the subtle wires mote not discover, perceive. avize,But deem in sooth that all he did or said,From his own motion and free grace did rise,And that he justly hight immortal, great, and wise.XXXI.And eke to each of that same gilded train,That meekly round that lordly throne did stand,Was by that wizard ty'd a magick chain,Whereby their actions all he mote command,And rule with hidden influence the land.Yet to his lord he outwardly did bend,And those same magick chains within his handDid seem to place, albeit by the endHe held them fast, that none them from his gripe mote rend.XXXII.He was to weet an old and wrinkled mage,Deep read in all the arts of policy,And from experience grown so crafty sage,That none his secret counsels mote descry,Ne search the mines of his deep subtlety.Thereto fair peace he

King John came into England in 1357. I have taken the advantage of the licence usually allowed to poets, of departing a little from chronology; and have postponed for a few years the institution of this order, for the sake of rendering that solemnity more august, by introducing king John of France, who, though a prisoner, was treated both by Edward and his son the prince of Wales with all the regard due to the quality and virtue of so great a prince. To alleviate his captivity, Edward entertained him and the other French prisoners with diversions of various kinds: among which a tournament he held at Windsor on the 23d of April, to solemnize the feast of St. George, the patron of the order of the GARTER, held the chief place; and was, as Rapin tells us, the most sumptuous and magnificent that had ever been seen in England.

Before they appear, they sing the chorus, and afterwards, as they descend, the following songs; at the last stanza of which, the chariot of the GENIUS appears, and descends gradually all the while that and the grand chorus is singing.CHORUS of BARDS.Gentle Spirit, we obey;Thus along th' aetherial way,We attend our monarch's car;Thus we charm the silent air.SONG.First BARD.Ye southern gales, that ever flyIn frolic April's vernal train,Who, as ye skim along the sky,Dip your light pinions in the main,Then shake them fraught with genial show'rs,O'er blooming Flora's primrose bow'rs:2.Now cease awhile your wanton sport,Now drive each threat'ning cloud away;Then to the flow'ry vale resort,And hither all its sweets convey;And ever as ye dance along,With soft murmurs aid our song.SONG II.Second BARD.But lo! fair Windsor's tow'rs appear,And hills with spreading oaks imbrown'd!Hark! hark! the voice of joy I hear,Sung by a thousand echoes round;And now I view a glitt'ring train,In triumph march o'er yonder plain.Grand CHORUS of SPIRITS and BARDS.Hail mighty nation! ever fam'd in war!Lo! heav'n descends thy festivals to share;To view those heroes, whose immortal praiseCelestial bards shall sing in living lays.At the conclusion of this chorus, the GENIUS alights from his chariot, the front of which resembling the head of a man of war, is adorned with a carved lion, holding before his breast the arms of England, as they were borne by Edward. Behind, on a rais'd seat, sits the GENIUS, leaning upon an anchor of silver, and bearing in his right hand the vindicta, or wand of enfranchisement, and in his left a roll of parchment, upon which is written, in large letters of gold, MAGNA CHARTA. On his head is a corona rostrata, or naval crown; and his robe, of a sea-green colour, is embroidered with cornucopia's and golden tridents.GENIUS.Disdain not, ye blest denizens of air,To breathe this grosser atmosphere awhile,Your service I shall need; mean time resortTo yon imperial palace, and in airDraw up your squadrons in a radiant orb,Suspended o'er those lofty battlements,Like the bright halo that invests the moon,Or Saturn's lucid ring: thence shed benignYour choicest influence on the noble train,There on this solemn day assembled roundThe throne of British Edward: I awhileMust here await th' approach of other spirits,Sage Druids, Britain's old philosophers;Fetch'd by my summons from the western isles,That, scatter'd o'er the rough Hibernian flood,Seem like huge fragments by the wild wave tornFrom stormy Scotland, and the Cambrian shore.There, from the world retir'd in secret shades,Chiefly where Breint and Meinai wash'd the oaksOf ancient Mona, their academiesAnd schools of sage and moral disciplineThey held; and to the neighb'ring Britons round,From their rever'd tribunals, holy mounts,Dispens'd at once their oracles and laws.'Till fierce Paulinus, and his Roman bands,Them and their gods defying, drove them thenceTo seek for shelter in Hibernian shades.Yet still enamour'd of their ancient haunts,Unseen of mortal eyes, they hover roundTheir ruin'd altars, consecrated hillsOnce girt with spreading oaks, mysterious rowsOf rude enormous obelisks, that riseOrb within orb, stupendous monumentsOf artless architecture, such as nowOft times amaze the wand'ring traveller,By the pale moon discern'd on Sarum's plain.But hence, aërial spirits: lo, they come!Here the SPIRITS and BARDS, together with the chariot of the GENIUS, reascend, and at the same time the DRUIDS enter, cloath'd in dark-colour'd coarse stuff gowns

which before hang no lower than the knee, but behind almost touch the ground. The sleeves of these gowns reach down below the elbow, and from behind comes up a sort of hood or cowle, which hangs loose about the head and forehead. From the left shoulder hangs in a string a kind of pouch, or scrip, and rests on the right hip. In their right hand they hold a staff, and in their left an oaken branch. Their beards are very large and long, reaching below their waists. Their legs are naked, and their feet shod with sandals, which are fastened by thongs wound about the foot and the small of the leg.See a cut of the chief Druid in Rowland's Mona Antiqua restaurata, taken from a statue, p. 65.Enter DRUIDS.Chief DRUID.Inform us, happy spirit, protecting pow'rOf this our ancient country, wherefore nowFrom our sequester'd vallies, pensive grovesAnd dark recesses, thou hast summon'd usTo wait thy orders on this flow'ry hill?GENIUS.A great event, sage Druids, that no lessImports than this your ancient country's fame,From contemplation, and your silent shades,Calls you to meet me on this flow'ry hill.Know, in yon castle, whose proud battlementsSit like a regal crown upon the browOf high-climbing lawn, doth Edward holdThis day his solemn session to receiveThe pleas of all th' aspiring candidates,Who, summon'd by the Edward having communicated his intention of instituting the order of the GARTER to the great council of his realm, and having receiv'd their approbation, dispatch'd his heralds to severals parts of Europe, to invite all that were eminent for military virtue, &c. to be present at its institution. And his queen Philippa, on her part, assembled a train of 300 of the fairest ladies to grace the solemnity, and add to its magnificence. herald's publick voice,To Windsor, as to Fame's bright temple, hasteFrom ev'ry shore; the noble, wise, and brave,Knights, senators, and statesmen, lords and kings;Ambitious each to gain the splendid prize,By Edward promis'd to transcendent worth.For who of mortals is too great and highIn the career of virtue to contend?Of these selecting the most glorious names,Doth England's monarch purpose to composeA princely brotherhood, himself the chief,And worthy sov'reign of th' illustrious band;A band of heroes, listed in the causeOf honour, virtue, and celestial truth,Under the name and holy patronageOf Cappadocian GEORGE, Britannia's saint.Such is the plan by gen'rous Edward form'd;A plan of glory, that beyond the reachOf his own conquering arms, shall propagateThe sov'reignty of Britain, and erectHer monarchs into judges of mankind.But from this day's decisions, from the choiceOf his first collegues, shall succeeding timesOf Edward judge, and on his fame pronounce.For dignities and titles, when misplac'dUpon the vicious, the corrupt and vile,Like princely virgins to low peasants match'd,Descend from their nobility, and soil'dBy base alliance, not their pride aloneAnd native splendor lose, but shame retortEv'n on the sacred throne, from whence they sprung.So may the lustre of this order bright,This eldest child of chivalry be stain'd,If at her first espousals, her great sire,Caught by the specious outsides, that deceiveAnd captivate the world, admit the suitOf vain pretenders void of real worth;Light empty bubbles, by the wanton galeOf fortune swell'd, and only form'd to danceAnd glitter in the sun-shine of a court.Begin we then with Edward; first let himAt his own high tribunal undergoThe rigid inquisition—I for thisHave left my lucid star-encircled throne:For this, immortal sages have requir'dYour wise and prudent ministry, well skill'dIn various science and the human heart.Search Edward's to the bottom: sound the depthsAnd shallows of his soul; if he possessThat first of regal talents, to discernWith quick-ey'd penetration, thro' the veilOf art, each character's intrinsick worth,And all the labyrinths of the human mind.Nor blush for this good end yourselves to wearFallacious forms to plead the cause of falseBut specious merit; at his throne appearIn borrow'd shapes, and there with artful guile,When the shrill trumpet cites the candidates,Urge your pretensions: all the pow'r employOf wit and eloquence: Edward, I trust,The trial shall abide; which shall but tendTo manifest, that not from arrogance,But conscious virtue, hath he thus assum'dAbove all other kings, to be the judgeAnd great rewarder of heroic deeds.Nor wholly unassisted will I leaveMy royal charge, but with blest influence clearHis intellectual eye from the dim mistsIt haply hath contracted from a longUnebbing current of felicity,Unhop'd, unequall'd triumphs, from the viewOf captive monarchs, and the glitt'ring throng,Who at his summons from all climates come,To take, as from their sov'reign, honours new.When heav'n tries mortals in unusual ways,'Tis fit it should afford unusual aid.Now, sages, to yon spreading oaks retireThere wait my summons; and mean time adviseHow best to execute the task enjoin'd.Ex. Gen. and Druids.The SCENE changes to a large room in the castle (St. George's Hall) at the upper end of which is a royal canopy with the figure of St George, and the motto of the Garter, HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE, beneath it embroider'd in gold. Under this canopy appears seated on an elevation of two or three steps, king Edward, in the habit of the order of the Garter, with a sceptre in his right hand, and a globe in his left. On his left hand is seated queen Philippa, with a crown upon her head, and dress'd in a royal mantle of crimson velvet, powder'd with embroider'd garters, and an enamel'dThat the ladies of the knights of the Garter wore this ensign of the order upon their left arms, may be seen in Ashmole's History of the Garter.garter bound like a bracelet upon her left arm. By her stand a great number of ladies very richly dress'd. On Edward's right hand is seated king John, in the imperial robes of France; and on the same side, but a step lower, sits Edward the Black Prince, in the robes belonging to the Prince of Wales. Next to queen Philippa are seated the rest of Edward's children; and next to the Black Prince, on the other side, stand the French prisoners, and a great number of lords, &c. richly dress'd.On the floor, at some distance, stands Garter king at arms in the habit of his office, holding in his hand a Garter, with the grand collar of the order. Near him stand other heralds, ushers, attendants, &c.Flourish of trumpets, kettle-drums, &c. After which Edward rising up from his throne, addresses himself to the assembly.EDWARD.That hither from your distant residence,By solemn invitation, noble guests,I have entreated your illustrious train,Misconstrue not to levity and pride,Or ostentatious vain magnificence,Unworthy the grave majesty of kings,Unworthy your atention, my renown.This bright assemblage of the wise, the brave,The noble, the magnificent, the fair,The ornaments of Europe, have I soughtTo grace the pomp of Virtue, to adornWith noblest off'rings her unspotted shrine,Attracting thus to her divine commandsThe aweful veneration of mankind.This was the cause, great princes, this the call,The voice of Virtue, not of England's king,That with respectful zeal ye hear'd and follow'd:From Burgundy's rich vineyards, from the meadsOf Hainault and Brabant, the rocky waveOf Danube, from Germania's warlike tow'rs,Imperial mother of an hundred states;From Spain, long exercis'd by Moorish arms,From Italy's fair princedoms, and the wallsOf sea-wash'd Venice, Adria's haughty spouse.With me then, all ye virtuous, by what stileRecorded in the registers of fame,Knights, senators, or soldiers, ermin'd lords,Or scepter'd princes; from whatever climeYe come, ennobled by heroic acts,With me unite the splendor of your namesTo dignify th' erection of a newAnd noble order, which to heav'n's high praise,And to heav'n's champion Cappadocian GEORGE,On this his holy festival I meanTo found a recompence for worthiest deeds.Thus as the orient sun, ador'd of oldBy prostrate Persia, ow'd his deityLess to that genial and benignant heatThat cherishes and warms the seeds of life,Than to those gorgeous beams, that deck with goldAnd crimson the gay portals of the morn;So shall this rising order owe its fameAnd brightest lustre to the splendid trainOf lords and purpled princes, who are metThis day to usher and adorn its birth.Nor deem that to allure heroic minds,My private int'rests partially to serve,To lift the valiant in ambition's cause,And form a league of conquest, I have laidIn subtle policy this great design:ASHAM'D BE HE WHO WITH MALIGNANT EYESO READS MY PURPOSE: and be he accurs'dWhoe'er in after-times shall so pervertThis sacred institution. To the worldI here consign it, to the good and greatOf every age and clime, and them alone.
Edward being engaged in a war with France, for the obtaining that crown, in order to draw into England great multitudes of foreigners, with whom he might negotiate either for their personal service, or aids of troops to assist him in that undertaking, ordered, during the truce that then subsisted between the two crowns, publication to be made of a great tournament, to be held at Windsor; an expedient, says Rapin, which could not fail of success, because it was entirely agreeable to the taste of that age. Accordingly many persons of distinction came over, to all of whom he gave an honourable reception, caressing them in such a manner that they could never sufficiently admire his politeness, magnificence, and liberality. To render these entertainments the more solemn, and to free himself also from the ceremonies, to which the difference of rank and condition would have subjected him, he caused a circular hall of boards to be run up at Windsor, 200 feet in diameter. There it was that he feasted all the knights at one table, which was called the Round Table, in memory of the great Arthur, who, as it is pretended, instituted an order of knighthood by that name. Next year he caused a more solid building to be erected, that he might continue yearly the same diversions. During that time he treated with these several lords about the aids, wherewith each could furnish him, in proportion to his forces. His rival king Philip could not see without jealousy, Spaniards, Italians, Germans, Flemings, and Frenchmen themselves flock to England to assist at these tournaments. He suspected some hidden design in these ntertainments, and to break Edward's measures, caused the like to be published in his dominions; which meeting with success, proved a countermine to Edward's main design, so that he did not long continue to keep up his round table. From thence, however, it is generally agreed, he took the first hint of instituting the order of the Garter. But as his purpose in erecting this order was very different from that which had induced him to revive Arthur's round table, as he had in this no private views, no ambitious scheme of engaging such as should be admitted into this fraternity to assist him in his wars, he thought proper, in order to obviate the like jealousies and suspicion as had alarmed king Philip, to signify by his motto the purity of his intentions, and to retort shame upon all those who should put any malignant construction upon his design in instituting this order. This therefore I take to be the true meaning and import of the famous motto, HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE. The not understanding the purport of which, gave rise, in all probability, to that vulgar story of the countess of Salisbury's garter, rejected by all the best writers.Now sound the trumpet; bid the candidatesWith confidence appear, and urge their claims.Flourish of trumpets, &c. which is answered by another trumpet from without; then enter a grandee of Spain, magnificently attir'd in the Spanish habit, holding in his hand the pedigree of his family, and preceded by heralds, &c. bearing atchievements, banners, coats of armour, helmets, gauntlets, spurs, &c.SPANIARD.Illustrious monarch! emp'ror of the isles!My name is Guzman—from those heroes sprung,Who with Pelagio 'mid th' Asturian rocksAgainst th' invasion of unnumber'd Moors,Maintain'd the same and empire of the Goths,And founded at Oviedo once againThe Spanish monarchy and cath'lick faith,Transporting from the mountain's dreary wombTo glitt'ring temples her most holy altars.Thence on the bordering Moor their valiant sonsWaging incessant war, ere long regain'dTheir ancient realms of Leon, Arragon,And rich Castilia: in which great exploitsMy brave progenitors, by valour, zeal,And loyalty distinguish'd, from their kingsGain'd those high honours, princely signories,And proud prerogatives, which have extoll'dThe name of Guzman to such envy'd grandeur,That scarce above it towers the regal throne.These honours undiminish'd, undefil'd,To me deliver'd down, might well contentA vulgar mind; but spirits highly bornAre full of gen'rous and aspiring thoughts;And use the vantage ground of rank and pow'rBut to ascend still higher. Thus I comeThy GARTER to sollicit; pleas'd, great prince,With thee to be enroll'd thy brother knight,And fearing no repulse. Nobility,As nearest in her orbit, first receivesThe beams of majesty; alone can bearThe fulness of that glory, which o'erpow'rsInferior natures. Virtue's self would blush,Did she at once approach too near the throne.But the young eagle borne amid the blazeOf glancing lightnings, with undazzled eyeSoars to the courts of heav'n, and perches boldOn the bright sceptre of imperial Jove.The greatest king is he, who is the kingOf greatest subjects. Seek'st thou to advanceThe glory of thy order? To thy selfAssociate those, whose high-exalted namesFor ages past from Envy's self have forc'dHabitual veneration, never paidTo new and upstart merit.

View this scroll,The faithful blazon of my ancient line,A line of potentates, whose ev'ry sonDeserv'd to wear the GARTER I demand.In me their representative, the heir,Of all their honours, son of their renown,Do thou reward their virtues: in their namesI claim, and on hereditary right,The right of monarchs, Edward, rest my plea.EDWARD.The high desert of thy renown'd forefathersWell hast thou shewn; but hast thou therefore prov'dThy self deserving to be call'd their son?To thee their prosp'rous virtues have indeedTransmitted lineal rank, and titles proud,By them more hardly gain'd; for which thou stand'stTo custom and th' indulgence of thy countryIndebted, Guzman, in a large account;Which thou must first discharge by noble deeds,Ere thou canst stile those dignities thine own.This if thou hast not paid, why dost thou seek,Like thriftless prodigals, to swell the debt,And overwhelm thy self with obligations?Virtue is honour, and the noblest titlesAre but the public stamps set on the oreTo ascertain its value to mankind.It were a kind of treason to my crown,To mark base metal with the royal impress,And put off lazy pride in virtue's name.Wou'dst thou attain my GARTER? Seek it thereWhere thy heroic ancestors acquir'dTheir glorious honours, in th' embattled fieldAmong the squadrons of the warlike Moors:Or in the council of thy king, by truthAnd wisdom equal to th' important trust.Be what thy fathers were, and then returnTo ask the pledge of merit from my hand,And be the fit companion of a king.
Exit Spaniard.Flourish of trumpets, &c. which, as before, is answered by another trumpet from without; then enter an usurer and senator of Genoa (at that time the bank of Europe) dress'd in his senatorial gown of black velvet, profusely, but aukwardly adorn'd with jewels, pearls and diamond necklaces, pendents, bracelets, rings, such as he may be supposed to have received as pawns, and to wear rather as marks of his great riches, than as ornaments of his dress. He is attended by a large train of people of every profession, appearing to be his debtors, by their abject and timid countenances, at the head of whom, and next to the usurer, marches a scrivener, bearing a large bundle of bonds, mortgages, &c.GENOESE.From Genoa the opulent, the bankAnd treasury of the world, most puissant king,Invited by thy heralds, am I comeTo claim the honour by thy promise due,Due by thy justice to superior worth;Due then to me, great Edward, who possessThat object of the toils, the cares, the vowsOf all mankind, that comprehensive good,Source of all pow'r and grandeur, boundless wealth.Behold yon glitt'ring train, whose sumptuous pride,Bright with the treasures of each precious mine,Invests with glory thy imperial throne:Whence is their dignity? The ray august,That awes and dazzles the respectful crowd,Proceeds it from nobility, from virtue,Their wisdom, or their valour, or their fame?Comes it not rather from the beaming ore?The diamond's star-like radiance? Wealth, O king,Wealth is the sun that decks the gorgeous scene;That cherishes, adorns, and calls to viewThese princely flowers of honour, virtue, fame,Which in the shades of poverty were lost.Whatever men desire or venerate,On wealth attends; ev'n empire's self is bought.Nor cou'd the mighty Julius have attain'dBy wisdom or by valour sov'reign pow'r,Had not the gold of vanquish'd Gaul subdu'dThe liberties of Rome. On wretched want,Contempt and narrow-soul'd dependence wait.Ev'n kings, of necessary wealth depriv'd,In powerless indigence lose all respect,All homage from their subjects: while the rich,Like gods ador'd, o'er ev'ry neck extendTheir potent sceptres, and in golden chainsFierce Faction and rebellious Freedom bind.The glory, strength, importance of a realmIs measur'd by its riches: Venice thus,Thus Genoa's petty state out-balances,In Europe's scale, the boundless wilds that cloathWith tributary furs the Russian Czar.With like pre-eminence exalted shinesIn ev'ry land above the proudest names,The blest possessor of all-worship'd gold.My birth or rank I boast not here, though bornA senator of Genoa. The desert,On which I found my claim, is all my own;To have adorn'd and dignify'd the stateOf my declining house with greater wealthThan e'er my thriftless ancestors possess'd;Whose richest acquisitions were but sprigsOf barren laurel, or the flaunting ragsOf some torn ensign, to their needy sonA worthless heritage. Yet not to swellMy narrow fortunes wou'd my soul descendTo the base methods of ignoble trade,And vulgar mercantile pursuit of gain.Mine were the noble arts of raising goldFrom gold, of nursing and improving wealthBy gainful use; arts practis'd heretoforeBy senators and sages of old Rome,Illustrious Crassus, and wise Seneca.Thus have I grac'd the splendor of my nameWith suitable possessions; thus I holdIn firm subjection to my will the poorOf ev'ry rank and order, soldier, priest,The vent'rous merchant, and the sumptuous lord,Who in a lower vassalage to me,Than to thy sceptre, Edward, bow their heads,Pledging their lands and liberties for gold.Hence am I bold to stand before thy throneA candidate for glory's highest prize:And let me add, that policy aloneShou'd teach thy prudence to approve my claim;Shou'd teach thee in thy subjects to excite,By honours on superior wealth bestow'd,An useful emulation to be rich:Which once inspir'd, thy Albion shall becomeThe first of nations, thou the first of kings.EDWARD.Hadst thou by op'ning to thy native landThe golden veins of commerce, by employingThe useful hands of industry in worksOf national advantage, by unitingRemotest regions in the friendly bandsAnd honest intercourse of mutual trade;Hadst thou by these humane and generous arts,Which thy mistaken pride so much disdains,Enrich'd at once thy country and thy self,Then not unworthy hadst thou been to wearThe brightest marks of honour; but thy wealth,The base-born child of sordid usury,That foe to commerce, nurse of idleness,Stains and degrades thee from thy noble birth;Nor in the usurer can I discernThe senator of Genoa.—To enlargeThe mind with gen'rous sentiments, to raiseIts aims by virtuous emulation, hereI sit; but not to gild with honour's beamsThat selfish passion which congeals the heart,And stops the streams of sweet benevolence,Mean avarice, the vice of narrowest souls,Incapable of glory.—Wealth, thou say'st,Can buy ev'n empire, and to Julius gaveDominion o'er his country—Fatal gift,And ruinous to both! But what to Rome,What to that Caesar's successors avail'dThe boundless treasures of the ravag'd world,When they had lost their virtue? Did not soonThe valiant sons of poverty, the Goths,The Huns and Vandals, from their barren hillsAnd rugged woods descending, to their steelSubject the Roman gold? Yet I deny notThe pow'r and use of riches: to the wiseAnd good, in publick or in private life,They are the means of virtue, and best serveThe noblest purposes; but in the use,Not in the bare possession, lies the merit.Shew me thy merit then, thy bounteous acts,Publick munificence, or private alms,The hungry and the naked, and the sick,Sustain'd and cherish'd by thy saving hand;Plead this, and I allow thy worthy claim,For this is virtue, and deserves reward.Ex. Gen.Flourish of trumpets, &c. which is answered by a symphony of flutes, violins, &c. playing a light amorous air; then appears a Neapolitan courtier, a favourite of queen Joan, who then reign'd at Naples, and whose court was the most debauch'd and dissolute of that age. He comes in with a gay and affected gesture, and is dress'd in loose silken robes, rich, but finical and esseminate; on his hair, which is curl'd and spread all over his shoulders down to the middle of his back, he wears a chaplet of roses, and is attended by a train of beautiful boys, habited like Cupids, and musicians, who, as he marches towards the throne, continue playing their soft and wanton airs.NEAPOLITAN.Not on my wealth, nor on my noble blood,Shall I presume to claim thy royal gift,Auspicious prince, but on the skill to giveThat splendor to nobility and wealth,That elegance of taste, from which aloneTheir value they derive; of this to judge,This to direct, I boast, fit arbiterOf all refin'd delights.—But chief to kingsMy happy talents I devote; on themMy genius waits with duteous care, and waftsThe golden cup of pleasure to their lips,Like Ganymede before the throne of Jove.And who indeed would wish to be a godOnly to thunder, and to hear the pray'rsOf clam'rous suitors? 'Tis the nectar'd feast,The dance of Graces, and the wanton charmsOf Venus, sporting with the Smiles and Loves,That make the court of heav'n a blest abode.Far happier were the meanest peasant's lotWho sleeps or sings in careless ease beneathThe sun-burnt hay-cock, or the flow'ry thorn,Than to be plac'd on high in anxious pride,The purple drudge and slave of tiresome state,If to superior pow'r superior meansOf joy were not annex'd, and larger scopeFor ev'ry wish the lavish heart can form:If the soft hand of pleasure did not wreatheAround the royal diadem, whose weightOppressive loads the monarch's aching brow,Her fairest growth of ever-blooming flow'rs.On thee, victorious prince, propitious FortuneHath pour'd her richest gifts, renown and wealth,And greatness equal to thy mighty mind;One only bliss is wanting to thy court,Voluptuous elegance, the lovely childOf ease and opulence; that never comes,But like a bird of summer to attendThe brightest sun-shine of a glorious state.To her, and her alone belongs the task,By learned delicacy to removeWhat yet remains in this thy ancient realmOf Gothick barbarism, the rust of war,And valiant ignorance.—Her artful handThy rugged Britons shall refine, and teachMore courtly manners, to their sov'reign's willPolitely pliant: do but thou commandThy willing servant, with thy favours grac'd,From fair Joanna's ever-smiling court,Under whose happy influence I was train'd,From polish'd Naples, her delightful seat,The blooming goddess to transport, with allHer train of joys, and fix them here beneathThy great protection.—But perhaps thou fear'stThe voice of censure, and the grave reproofOf moralizing dullness: idle fear!The vulgar herd, indeed, religious craftAnd policy of state have well confin'dWith wise severity to rigid laws:Else would that headstrong beast the multitudeForget obedience, and its rider's voiceDisdain. But shall the rider put a curbIn his own mouth? The laws that kings have madeShall they restrain the makers? Edward, no!For thee indulgent justice shall relaxHer harsh decrees, and piety shall waitTo give her rev'rend sanction to thy will.'Tis thine to rove at large thro' nature's field,Crop ev'ry flow'r, and taste of ev'ry fruit;By sweet variety provoking stillThe languid appetite to new desires.Nor useless to thy pleasures, happy prince,Shall be my faithful service; nicer joys,Joys of a quicker, more exalted taste,Than ever ripen'd in this northern clime,The growth of softer regions, shall my handBy skilful culture in thy Britain raise.To them, whose gross and dull capacitiesAre fit to bear the burthens of the state,The lab'ring mules, that thro' the mire of formsDraw the slow car of government along,Gladly the task of bus'ness I resign.Be mine the brighter province, to directThy pleasures, Edward, minister supremeOf all thy softer hours: to serve the kingBe theirs the glory, let me serve the man.But shou'd thy sterner Genius, only pleas'dWith arms and royalty's important cares,The duties of a king, my gentle artsToo lightly prize, and thence reject my suit:Permit at least, that to Philippa's ear,Divine Philippa, thine and beauty's queen,And her attendant graces, I may pleadThe cause of bliss, a cause so much their own:They will approve my claim, to whom the cares,The labours of my life, my head, my heartAre all devoted—Let me from their handsReceive the GARTER, and be call'd their knight.PHILIPPA.Permit me, gracious Edward, to replyTo this irreverent flatt'rer, who presumesBefore a matron and a queen to pleadThe cause of vice, and impudently hopesTo find in her a fautress of his suit.But know, pernicious sophister, my heartHath learn'd from Edward's love, and this high rankWhich I partake with him, a noble pride,That ill can brook the too familiar eyeAnd saucy tongue of riot and debauch;In whose unmanner'd light society,Nor majesty, nor virtue can maintainThat dignity, which is their proper guard.Thy vile refinements, and luxurious arts,Miscall'd politeness, I detest; and feel,In the soft duties of a virtuous love,Such pure, serene delight, as far transcendsWhat thou styl'st pleasure, the delirious joyOf an intoxicated feverish brain.Behold my royal lord, the first and bestOf kings, the love and wonder of mankind!Behold my children, worthy their great sire,The gen'ral theme of praise and benediction!These are my pleasures; can thy skill bestowSuperior bliss? Ah no, the vain attempt.Wou'd only bring disgust, remorse, and shame.EDWARD.That I have lov'd, Philippa, and esteem'd theeMore for thy virtues than those female charms,Which this vile flatterer deems singly worthHis panegyrick, be thy happinessAnd glory, as it is thy Edward's pride.With the like spirit have I also woo'dAnd wedded sov'reign power; nor weakly caughtWith outward pomp, or seeking to myselfA privilege to riot uncontroul'dIn sensual pleasures, and behind the throneTo laugh securely at restraint and law.No: I embrac'd her as the child of heav'n,Dowr'd with the ample means of doing good;From whose espousals I might hope to raiseAn offspring, worth th' ambition of a king,Immortal glory; to a gen'rous mindAs far surpassing all the wanton toys,Which he calls pleasure, as thy faithful love(The sweet o'erflowing of heart-felt delight)Excels, Philippa, the lascivious smileOf common prostitutes, caress'd and loath'd.Hence from my sight with thy detested arts,Base minister of luxury, the baneOf ev'ry flourishing and happy state:Presume no more within my court to singThy Syren-song, nor soften into slavesAnd cowards my brave subjects.—I disdainThat elegance, which such as thou can teach.Virtue alone is elegant, alonePolite; vice must be sordid and deform'd,Tho' to adorn her ev'ry art contend.And rather wou'd I see my Britons roamUntutor'd savages, among the woods,As once they did, in naked innocence,Than polish'd like the vile degenerate raceOf modern Italy's corrupted sons.Exit Neap.Trumpet sounds, and is answer'd from without by another trumpet, which sounds a march, accompanied by kettledrums, and other warlike instruments: Then enters, preceded by soldiers playing upon fifes, and others bearing tatter'd ensigns, standards and trophies, a leader of mercenary bands, compleatly arm'd from head to foot, and carrying in his right hand a baton or truncheon. On each side of him march his 'squires, one bearing his lance, the other his shield. Behind him, as his attendants, comes a train of officers and soldiers maimed, and their faces all seam'd with scars.SOLDIER.Nor riches, nor nobility of birth,Nor the soft arts of base effem'nate ease,Which justly thou rejectest, valiant prince,But thy own darling attribute I boast,Undaunted courage, try'd in many a field,In ev'ry clime, and under ev'ry banner,That for these forty summers have been wav'dO'er Europe's plains, by Ister, Rhine, and Po,Hungarian and Bohemian, Flemish, French,Venetian, Spanish, Guelph and Gibbeline:Whence in just confidence secure I comeThis military honour to demand,Due to my toils and service, to my wounds,My laurels, and that generous love of glory,Which without any call, or publick cause,Or private animosity, aloneRais'd my strong arm, and drew my dreadful sword.Wherever Mars his crimson flag display'd,That was my country, thither swift I boreMy ready valour, and the dauntless bandOf various nations, under my command,Prepar'd to sell their blood, their limbs, their lives:Nor where the right, nor where the justest cause,Deign'd we to ask—those intricate debatesWe left to lazy penmen in the shadeOf coward ease; while our impetuous fireStill bore us forward, ardent to pursueThro' danger's roughest paths the steps to fame.On such a spirit should thy favour smile.But let me wonder, Edward, that so longThy ear the vain pretensions cou'd endureOf men unknown to war, attendants meetOf some luxurious Asiatic court,Or female distaff-reign; but suiting illThe presence of a monarch great in arms.Hadst thou to those inglorious sons of peaceThy martial order giv'n, the warrior-saintHad blush'd to see his image so profan'd,Which on my manly breast, indented o'erWith many a noble scar, will fitly shine.But wherefore stand I thus haranguing here,Unskilful as I am in smooth discourse,The coward's argument? On force aloneI rest my title: let the glorious prizeBe hung on high amid the listed field,And let me there dispute it; there my lanceShall plead my cause far better than my tongue,If any dare deny my rightful claim.EDWARD.Not for the brave alone have I ordain'dThis institution, but for all desert,All publick virtue, wisdom, all that serves,Improves, defends, or dignifies a state:Tho' first indeed to valour, as the guardOf all the rest, when in the publick cause,With justice and benevolence employ'd.But thou, base mercenary, canst thou dareThe glorious name of valour to usurp,Who know'st no publick cause, no sense of right,Nor pity, nor affection, nor remorse?Who under any chief, in any quarrel,Canst stain with gore thy prostituted arms?Call it not love of glory; that is builtOn acts for the deliv'rance of mankind;On gen'rous principles, and noble scornOf sordid int'rest: call it cruel pride,And savageness of nature, that delightsTo conquer, and oppress, afflict, insult;Or call it love of plunder, that can drawUnauthoris'd, uninjur'd, unprovok'd,The sword of war; that bravo-like can liftFor hire the venal hand to perpetrateAssassinations, murders, massacres.But thou hast serv'd with courage: be it so—Thou hast thy pay, and with it thy reward;Pretend no farther, nor compare thy deeds,Dishonour'd by the mean desire of gain,With his, who for his country and his kingResigns his ease, his fortune, or his life.Those battles thou hast fought, those forty yearsOf blood and horror, which thy vaunting tongueSo high hath sounded, are indeed thy crimes,Flagitious crimes; for which th' impartial barOf reason wou'd condemn thee, as the foeOf human nature, did not custom screenBy her unjust esteem thy guilty head.But hope not honour or employment here.Unsafe and wretched is that monarch's stateWho weakly trusts to mercenary bands,The guard or of his person, or his realm:Unfaithful, insolent, rapacious, baseHe soon shall prove them, and become himselfTheir slave, to hold his kingdom at their will.For this within my Britain have I soughtTo raise a martial spirit, and ordain'dThese new incitements, honours, and rewards,To virtuous chivalry, that never kingWho wears hereafter my imperial crown,May need to stoop to the precarious aidOf venal foreign swords; but in the heartsOf his brave subjects find a stronger guard,Prepar'd with zeal unbought, and English valour,His rights to vindicate, and save their own.Exit Soldier.Trumpet sounds, to which another from without replies: Then enters an Italian politician, habited like a Venetian nobleman, who advancing with a solemn and important air towards the throne, makes a low reverence to king Edward, and proceeds.POLITICIAN.Well has thy sovereign wisdom, royal judge,The suit refus'd of these pretenders vain,And, by rejecting them, embolden'd me.For valour, and nobility, and wealth,Though by their proud possessors vaunted high,Are but subordinate, the slaves and tools,Not the companions, and the counsellorsOf godlike monarchy; whose aweful throneBy darksome clouds envelop'd, far beyondThe ken of vulgar eyes, supported standsOn that deep-rooted prop, the craft of state,Mysterious policy.—Who best hath learn'dHer wily lessons, best deserves to shareThe honours, counsels, and the hearts of kings.By him instructed, ev'n the meanest princeShall rise to envy'd greatness, shall advanceHis dreaded pow'r above restraint and fear,And all the rules that in fantastic chainsInferior minds confine. Thus Milan's dukes,Thus Padua's lords above their country's lawsHave rais'd their heads, and trampled to the dustThe pride of freedom, that essays in vainTheir high superior genius to controul.These were my masters, mighty prince; beneathTheir rule, and in their councils was I form'dTo know the false corrupted heart of man,His ev'ry weakness, ev'ry vice, and thenceTo tempt, or break his passions to the yoke:To scorn the publick as an empty name,And on the helpless multitude imposeThe adamantine bonds of fraud and force.Thus was I train'd, thus fitted to conductThe fate of proudest empires; thus I comeTo claim thy GARTER, Edward, the just meedOf worth praeeminent, and in returnMy services to offer, which no doubtThy wisdom gladly will accept: for whoSo fit to serve the majesty of kings,As he, who slighting ev'ry meaner tye,Friends, parents, country, to advance their pow'rDevotes his toil, experience, fortune, fame,Nor other favour courts, nor refuge hopesBut in their high protection? — Led by me,Thou, royal Edward, shalt attain that height,That glorious summit of imperial pow'r,Which not thy mighty ancestors have reach'd;Where in a freer air, a more enlarg'dHorizon, bounded only by thy will,Thou shalt exalted sit, and view beneath,In humbler distances and safer bounds,Those subjects, who presumptuous now approachToo near, and with rude hands profane thy throne.Nor let weak scruples check thy manly soulIn the bright task of glory; know, great prince,A king's divinity is sov'reign pow'r,The only god, before whose shrine the wiseTheir incense offer, whence inspir'd, they drawDivine ambition, and heroic scornOf vulgar prejudices, vulgar fears.Virtue's the people's idol, and by themRewarded well with popular applause,That idle breath, the gift and prize of fools.'Tis thine to govern, not to court mankind,Nor on their smiles precarious to depend,But nobly force them to depend on thine.O sacred sir, can virtue give thee this,This bright supremacy? Trust not her boasts,Her idle pageanty of barren praise:Reject her saucy claims, importunate,And self-supported; nor admit her train,Proud independency, and publick zeal,Those factious demagogues, the foes of kings.EDWARD.Are virtue then, and love of publick good,The foes of monarchy? and are deceit,Injustice and oppression, qualitiesBecoming and expedient in a king?Then know I not to govern; but have nurs'dFor twice these fifteen years ev'n in my heart,A pois'nous viper; nay unking'd myself,By yielding to restrain my sov'reign pow'rWith laws and charters of enfranchisement,Not due, it seems, from monarchs to their slaves.But know, vile counsellor of infamy,That I disdain thy politics, those falseAnd shallow politics, by which my sire,Weak judging Edward, was betray'd to shameAnd foul destruction, while to such as theeHis ear and heart incautious he resign'd,And was indeed their slave, not England's king.By maxims different far have I sustain'dThe strength and splendor of my regal state,On the broad basis of true wisdom fix'dWith solid firmness. By encouragingThe gen'rous love of virtue and of fame,That source of valour, pledge of victory.By granting to my subjects, what indeedIs their inherent right, security,The cheerful father of content and peace,Of industry and opulence, which fillsWith smiling multitudes the land, and paysIn willing subsidies that prince's care,Who lays up treasure in his people's hearts.By holding with a firm impartial handThe sleddy scale of justice; not aloneBetwixt my subjects in their private rights,But in the gen'ral, more important cause,Betwixt the crown and them, the diff'rent claimsOf freedom and of just prerogative:Transgressing not myself by boundless pow'r,Nor suff'ring others to transgress those laws,That in their golden chain together bind▪For common good, the whole united state.But more than all, by guarding from contempt,Or impious violation, that supremeProtrectress of all government and law,Religion; in whose train for ever waitObedience, order, justice, mercy, love,A guard of angels plac'd around the throne.Her sacred counsels have I still rever'd,Her high commands enforc'd, her pow'r implor'd,O'er all my subject nations to call downFrom heav'nly wisdom, her eternal fire,A fix'd secure felicity, beyondThe force of human prudence to attain.These are my arts of government, those artsBy which my British crown I have advanc'dAbove th' imperial diadem, aboveThe pride of Afric's, or of Asia's thrones.I wou'd not tell thee this, but that thou seem'stA stranger to my fame, as to my realm,And to the real greatness of a king:Whose sacred dignity, by thee traduc'd,Much it behoves a king to vindicate;Not by rejecting only with disdainThy arrogant pretensions, but in theeDishonouring and branding with reproachThy tenets also, the pernicious loreOf tyrants and usurpers, which thy tongue,Blaspheming justice, government, and law,Hath in a land of freedom dar'd to vent.Hence! from my kingdom, with thy quickest speed,Lest the revenge of an insulted kingWith sudden ruin intercept thy flight.
Exit Politician.King JOHN.Permit me, Edward, to thy royal voiceTo add my suffrage also, and with theeProtest against this coward policy,That meanly skulks behind opprobrious fraud,And low unprincely artifice; I feelA virtue in my heart, a gen'rous pride,That tells me kings were cloath'd with majesty,Encircled with authority, rever'dAnd almost deify'd, to teach them thenceThat goodness and the saving attributesOf heav'n become their office, justice chief,And truth, the virtue of heroic minds,Which, were it banish'd from all other breasts,Should dwell for ever in the hearts of kings.Aërial musick, upon which re-enter the five Druids who personated the Grandee, &c. in their original characters and habits of Druids, the chief of whom advancing towards the throne, addresses himself to king Edward.Chief DRUID.Behold in us, great king, the ancient priestsAnd judges of this land, the Druids old:Who late in borrow'd characters have stoodBefore thy sage tribunal, to preferThe claims of valour, wealth, nobility,And those soft specious flatt'rers, who beneathThe rosy wreath of pleasure and of loveConceal the sickly and disgustful browOf riot and debauch, and often winFrom weak unmanly princes the rich prizeTo virtue due and wisdom, not to theseThe cankers of a state; but least of allDue to that traytor of his king and country,Who lab'ring to build up the regal throneBeyond its due proportion, and the strengthOf those foundations which the laws have laid,O'erwhelms the people, and at once o'erturnsHis royal master, places him at bestOn an uneasy tott'ring pinnacle,The mark of execration and reproach.These claims hast thou rejected; like a kingDiscerning in mankind, and knowing wellThe value of his favours: like a kingDeserving the high office of the judgeAnd arbiter of Europe: like a kingEqual to his great fame, and worth the careOf those immortal spirits, who this dayHave quitted their celestial residence,To view and to approve thy glorious deeds.But, Edward, be not thou amaz'd to findThat those who lately for thy favour su'dWere not the personages they assum'd.O king! thou art beset with counterfeitsThe very opposites to us, who seemFar better than they are. For Flattery,Cameleon-like, accommodates with careTo the court-hue his changeful countenance.And when a prince is brave, magnanimous,And high in spirit, then Ambition wearsA face of dignity, and nothing breathesBut lofty enterprizes, conquest, pow'r,And schemes of glory to the sov'reign ear,Pretending love and care for his renownWith more than duteous zeal.—Of these beware!For as the Theban queen, in fables old,Was, by the specious guile of fraudful Jove,In her Amphitryon's form to guilt betray'd,So by these counterfeits are kings seduc'd,Ev'n in the most belov'd suspectless shapes,To take a traytor to their royal arms.But thou shalt know them, Edward, by their works,And of this truth be most assur'd, that he,Who in his private commerce with mankindIs mean, dishonest, interested, false,Can ne'er be true to thee; nor can he loveHis prince, who feels not for his country's good.Thus warn'd we leave thee, mighty prince: be firm,Be constant in the paths of fair renown.Think it thy duty to revere thyselfThe sacred laws of chivalry, the wiseInjunctions by thy order laid on allThe GARTER'D KNIGHTS; so shall thy fame remainThe great example of all future kings.Farewell! for lo! the Genius of thy realmWith all his pomp attended, comes to share,And grace the glories of this signal day.These clouds of fragrance, that far-beaming blazeOf heav'nly brightness, his approach declare.Druids vanish.Flashes of light, and symphony of aërial musick. Genius of England descends in his chariot attended by spirits and bards; then alighting, he advances towards the throne, and addresses himself to Edward.GENIUS.From the gay realms of cloudless day I come,Where in the glitter of unnumber'd worlds,That like to isles of various magnitudesFloat in the ocean of unbounded space;On my invisible aërial throneI sit, attended with a radiant bandOf spirits immortal, whose pure essences,While clad in human shapes on earth they dwelt,Thro' the dull clay of gross mortalityDisclos'd their heav'nly vigour, and burst forthIn godlike virtues and heroic deeds,Their Albion gracing with as fair a growthOf fame, as e'er enrich'd imperial Rome.Thence ripe for heav'n and immortality,To me, the Genius of this happy isle,They fly, and claim the meed of their desert,Celestial crowns, and ever-living praiseRecorded in the songs of heav'nly bards,That round my throne their hymns of triumph sing,Attuning to the sweet harmonious spheresTheir undiscording lyres and voice divine.Nor thus remov'd to heav'n, and thus employ'dIn careless raptures, wont they to forgetTheir native country, and the public weal,To which on earth their labours and their livesThey once devoted; but pursuing stillThe bent and habit of their souls, with meThey watch the British empire, still intentTo check alternately th' incroaching wavesOf regal pow'r and popular liberty:I, chief attentive near the royal throne,Take up my watchful station, to infuseMy sage and mod'rate counsels in those ears,Which wisdom hath prepar'd and purify'dTo relish honest, tho' unpleasing truth.Thus am I always, tho' invisible,Attendant, Edward, on thy glorious deeds.But on this solemn day have I vouchsaf'dTo manifest my presence; to declare,Not in those whispers which have often spokePeace to thy conscious heart, but audiblyAnd evident to all, th' assent of heav'nTo the great business, which hath gather'd hereThis troop of princes from all nations round.Hence all may know that virtue hath a trainMore bright than earthly empire can command:Know, that those actions which are great and good,Receive a nobler sanction from the freeAnd universal voice of all mankind,Which is the voice of heav'n, than from the highest,The most illustrious act of regal pow'r.This nobler sanction, Edward, in the nameNot of this age alone, but latest time,Here do I solemnly annex to eachOf thy great acts, but chief to this most wise,Most virtuous institution, which extendsWide as thy fame, beyond thy empire's bound,A prize of virtue publish'd to mankind.Ye registers of heav'n, record the deed.BARDS.Now tune, ye bards, the British lyre;Now wake the vocal string;While heav'n and earth in Edward's praise conspire,Join to the gen'ral voice your sacred choir,And on your soaring wing,From time and envy waft his glorious name,And place it in the shrine of incorruptive fame.Begin: the list'ning echoes roundShall catch with joy the long-forgotten sound,And warbling thro' each grove the British strainTo Windsor's smiling nymphs, recall their Arthur's reign.Ye nymphs of Windsor's bow'ry woods,Ye pow'rs who haunt yon glist'ning floods,That with reluctant fond delayAround yon flow'ry valley stray;Say, from your minds hath time eras'dThe pleasing images of glory pass'd?Review ye now those scenes no more?When nobly stain'd with Saxon gore,From Badon's long-contended plainGreat Arthur with his martial trainTo Windsor's chosen shades repair'd,And with his knights the festive banquet shar'd.Then first exulting Thames beheldThe triumphs of the listed field;Beheld along his level meadsCareering knights, encount'ring steeds,Heroic games, whose toils inspireThe thirst of praise, and kindle martial fire.Fair Peace in war's bright mail array'd,With smiles the glorious lists survey'd;So shou'd the brave (she cry'd) prepareTheir hearts and sinewy arms for war:Such combats break not my repose,Such sons best guard my rights from daring foes.Then too in feastful hall or bow'r,Attendant on the genial hour,The British harp sweet lyrists strung,And Albion's generous victors sung:While valiant Arthur's copious fameIncessant fed the bright poetic flame.But mortals erring in excess,O'erwhelm the virtue they caress.Thus Arthur his great story mourn'd,By too fond praise to fable turn'd:Mourn'd the companions of his toils,Mock'd with false glory and fantastic spoils.'Till thro' the dark romantic tale,Thro' superstition's magic veil,Sage Edward piercing view'd, and own'dThe chief with genuine lustre crown'd:View'd the great model, and restor'dThe long-lost honours of his martial board.Hail British prince! these faithful lays,Eternal records of heroic worth,Shall reassert thy ancient praise,And from the cloud of fiction call thee forth,In glory's sphere thy orbit to reclaim,And at great Edward's beam relume thy darken'd fame.But see in heav'nly panoply array'd,Whose streaming radiance skirts the clouds with gold,I view Pendragon burst the veiling shade,And all his blazing magnitude unfold!O'er yon broad tow'r he takes his airy stand,And pointing, Edward, towards the royal throne,To his fam'd knights around, a laurel'd band,Shews on thy knee the bright sky-tinctur'd zone.Virtue, he cries, (th' aetherial soundThy gross material organ cannot hear)Virtue on earth by British Edward crown'd.Her rev'rend throne once more shall rear.To her own self-applauding breastForc'd for reward no longer to retreat,She sees her aweful charms by kings caress'd,Sees honour woo her for his mate.Honour, her heav'n-elected spouse,From her embrace by lawless pow'r with-held,Now at yon altar plights his holy vows,Vows by assenting Edward seal'd.And now the fair angelic brideGath'ring her noble train from ev'ry land,To her late wedded lord with decent pridePresents the venerable band.The great procession Edward leads;I see yon hallow'd dome with heroes throng'd:Incessant still the white-plum'd pomp proceeds,Thro' time's eternal course prolong'd.And you, dear partners of my fame,Your ancient honours now again shall boast;This noble ORDER shall retrieve our name,In visionary fables lost.This from our martial board deriv'd,These for our brethren let us proudly own,More pleas'd to view our deeds by thee reviv'd,Then griev'd, great king, to be outdone.CHORUS.Hail British prince! these faithful laysShall reassert thy ancient praise.Nor thee, O Windsor, shall I pass unsung,Mansion of princes, and fit haunt of gods,Who frequent shall desert their bright abodes,To view thy sacred walls with trophies hung:Thy walls by British Arthur first renown'd,The early seat of chivalry and fame;By Edward now with deathless honours crown'd,Illustrious by his BIRTH, his GARTER, and his NAME.GENIUS.Conferring just rewards, most worthy prince,Is the first attribute of sov'reign pow'r,And that which best distinguishes a king:For punishment, and all the nice awardsOf civil justice, by the laws are fix'd,And kings but execute what they decree.While in rewarding merit, uncontroul'd,Unguided, unassisted is the handOf majesty; the prince himself aloneThere judges, and his wisdom is the law.Well does thy court, great king, with ev'ry worthAnd ev'ry virtue fill'd, this wisdom shewIn thee transcendent: well hast thou approv'dIts force in this great trial, which my pow'rCommanded, in no common ways to proveThy royal mind.—But that a father's nameMay not restrain thy justice in the choiceOf the first knights-companions of St. GEORGE,Myself here take upon me to presentA candidate, whom, were he not thy son,Thou wouldst thyself select from all mankind.His modesty compels me to declareThat candidate is Edward, prince of Wales.Prince EDWARD.Inhabitant of heav'n! I not presumeTo deprecate or question that high will,To which it best becomes me to submit.But, gentle spirit, be propitious to me;And thou, my gracious liege, if I requestThat this illustrious monarch, whose desertIs equal to the grandeur of his crown,May stand before me in this list of fame.King JOHN.O generous youth! in vain thy goodness strivesTo raise thy captive thus above his fortune.The king that is not free, is not a king;Nor can thy bounteous favour reconcileHonour and bondage.—To thy conqu'ring sonDo thou, great Edward, give this noble markOf prosp'rous virtue; ill becomes it me,To wear at once thy GARTER and thy chains.Though by my former dignity I swear,That were I reinstated in my throne,The thronc of Capet and of Charlemagne,Thus to be join'd in fellowship with thee,Would be the first ambition of my soul;A ray of glory I would sue to gain,And prize it equal with my diadem.GENIUS.Wisely thou hast determin'd, worthy prince,For thine and Edward's honour, and hast fix'dIts proper value on his royal gift,Which as the meed of merit, may becomeThe proudest monarchs, by this GARTER mark'dFor something more than monarchs, virtuous men.This be the glory of thy order, Edward.And Besides the great persons of our own nation, that have been admitted of this order, the English reader may be glad to be informed, that in the annals of the Garter are found the names of Charles V. emperor of Germany; of Francis I. and Henry IV. kings of France; and of Gustavus Adolphus king of Sweden. never shall it want the greatest namesOf all succeeding times to grace its annals.France, Sweden, Poland, Germany, and Spain,Each realm of Europe's wide-extended bounds,Shall count among thy knights its mightiest lords,And see, in emulation of thy fame,New royal founders of like orders rise.Proceed then, mighty king, and set the worldThe precedent of glory: thou beginThe radiant list of Sov'reigns, while thy son,Like a young bride, that on her nuptial mornLeads on with modest pride the virgin-choir,Herself the brightest, heads the shining bandOf knights-companions, nobly secondingHis father's glorious deeds with equal fame.EDWARD.The testimony of heav'n to thee, my son,Thus gloriously accorded, renders vainAll farther trial.—To my people's voice,By this their tutelary pow'r declar'd,With pleasure I consent, directing stillBy theirs my choice, my judgment, my desires.Approach then, my belov'd, my noble son,Strength of my crown, and honour of my realm;In whom my heart more joys, and glories more,Than in the highest pride of sov'reign pow'r.The prince of Wales advances to his father, and kneels; while the king, taking the Garter from the herald, buckles it round his left leg.Thus I admit thee, Edward prince of Wales,First founder of the order of St. GEORGE;In evidence whereof, about thy kneeI bind this mystic GARTER; to denoteThe bond of honour that together tiesThe brethren of St. GEORGE in friendly league,United to maintain the cause of truthAnd justice only— The sense, and almost the words in the verses of this speech, mark'd thus "are taken from the admonition read to the knights, at the time of their receiving the GARTER and the RIBBON or COLLAR of the order. Vide Ashmole's History of the order of the GARTER. "May propitious heav'n"Grant thou may'st henceforth wear it to his praise,"The exaltation of this noble order,"And thy own glory."—With like reverence,My son receive and wear this golden chain,"Grac'd with the image of Britannia's saint,"Heav'n's valiant soldier, CAPPADOCIAN GEORGE;"In imitation of whose glorious deeds"May'st thou triumphant in each state of life,"Or prosperous or adverse, still subdue"Thy spiritual and carnal enemies;"That not on earth alone thou may'st obtain"The guerdon of thy valour, endless praise,"But with the virtuous and the brave above,"In solemn triumph, wear celestial palms,"To crown thy final noblest victory."Embraces Pr. EDW.Prince EDWARD.Accept, my sovereign liege, my grateful thanks,That thou hast thus vouchsaf'd to place thy sonFirst next thyself upon the roll of fame,As he indeed is first in filial love,And emulation of thy royal virtuesAnd may thy benediction, gracious lord,May thy paternal vows be heard in heav'n!That he, whom thou hast listed in the causeOf truth and virtue, never may forgetHis vow'd engagements, nor defraud thy hopes,By soiling with dishonourable deedsThe lustre of that ORDER, which thy nameShou'd teach him to respect and to adorn.ODE.STROPHE I. BARDS.Celestial maid!Bright spark of that aetherial flame,Whose vivid spirit thro' all nature spread,Sustains and actuates this boundless frame!O by whatever stile to mortals known,Virtue, benevolence, or public zeal,Divine assessor of the regal throne,Divine protectress of the common weal,O in our hearts thy energy infuse!Be thou our Muse,Celestial maid,And, as of old, impart thy heav'nly aidTo those, who warm'd by thy benignant fire,To public merit and their country's goodDevoted ever their recording lyre,Wont along DEVA'S sacred flood,Or, beneath Mona's oak retir'd,To warble forth their patriot lays,And nourish with immortal praiseThe bright heroic flames by thee inspir'd.ANTISTROPHE I.I feel, I feelThy soul-invigorating heat;My bounding veins distend with fervent zeal,And to Britannia's fame responsive beat.—Hail Albion, native country! but how chang'dThy once grim aspect, how adorn'd and gayThy howling forests! where together rang'dThe naked hunter and his savage prey:Where amid black inhospitable woodsThe sedge-grown floodsAll cheerless stray'd.Not in their lonely wand'ring course survey'd,Or tow'r, or castle, heav'n-ascending fane,Or lowly village, residence of peaceAnd joyous industry, or furrow'd plain,Or lowing herd, or silver fleeceThat whitens now each verdant vale;While laden with their precious storeFar trading barks to every shore,Swift heralds of Britannia's glory, sail.EPODE I.These are thy shining works: this smiling faceOf beauteous nature thus in regal state,Deck'd by each handmaid art, each polish'd grace,That on fair liberty and order wait.This pomp, these riches, this repose,To thee imperial Britain owes.To thee, great substitute of heav'n,To whom the charge of earthly realms was giv'n;Their social systems by wise nature's planTo form and rule by her eternal laws;To teach the selfish soul of wayward manTo seek the publick good, and aid the common cause.So didst thou move the mighty heartOf Alfred, founder of the British state:So to Matilda's scepter'd son,To him whose virtue and renownFirst made the name of Edward great,Thy ample spirit so didst thou impart:Protecting thus in every age,From greedy pow'r and factious rage,The law of freedom, which to Britain's shoreFrom Saxon Elva's many-headed flood,The valiant sons of Odin with them bore,Their national, ador'd, inseparable good.STROPHE II.Runny Mead near Stains, where the Grand Charter was signed by king John. On yonder plain,Along whose willow-fringed sideThe silver-footed Naiads, sportive train,Down the smooth Thames amid the cygnets glide,I saw, when at thy reconciling word,Injustice, anarchy, intestine jar,Despotick insolence, the wasting sword,And all the brazen throats of civil war,Were hush'd in peace; from his imperious throneHurl'd furious down,Abash'd, dismay'd,Like a chas'd lion to the savage shadeOf his own forests, fell oppression fled,With vengeance brooding in his sullen breast.Then justice fearless rear'd her decent head,Heal'd every grief, each wrong redress'd;While round her valiant squadrons stood,And bade her aweful tongue demand,From vanquish'd John's reluctant hand,The deed of freedom purchas'd with their blood.ANTISTROPHE II.O vain surmise!To deem the grandeur of a crownConsists in lawless pow'r! to deem them wifeWho change security and fair renown,For detestation, shame, distrust, and fear!Who, shut for ever from the blissful bow'rs,With horror and remorse at distance hearThe musick that inchants th' immortal pow'rs,The heav'nly musick of well-purchas'd praise,Seraphick lays,The sweet rewardOn heroes, patriots, righteous kings conferr'd.For such alone the heav'n-taught poets sing.Tune ye for Edward, then, the mortal strain,His name shall well become your golden string,Begirt with this aetherial train,Seems he not rank'd among the gods?Then let him reap the glorious meedDue to each great heroic deed,And taste the pleasures of the blest abodes.EPODE II.Hail, happy prince! on whom kind Fate bestowsSublimer joys, and glory brighter farThan Cressy's palm, and every wreath that growsIn all the blood-stain'd field of prosp'rous war;Joys that might charm an heav'nly breast,To make dependent millions blest,A dying nation to restoreAnd save fall'n liberty with kingly pow'r;To quench the torch of discord and debate,Relume the languid spark of publick zeal,Repair the breaches of a shatter'd state,And gloriously compleat the plan of England's weal;Compleat the noble Gothick pile,That on the rock of justice rear'd shall standIn symmetry, and strength, and fame,A rival of that boasted frameWhich virtue rais'd on Tiber's strand.This, Edward, guardian, father of our isle,This god-like task, to few assign'd,Exalts thee above human-kind,And from the realms of everlasting dayCalls down celestial bards thy praise to sing;Calls this bright troop of spirits to surveyThee, the great miracle of earth, a PATRIOT-King.GENIUS.Now reascend your skies, immortal spirits!Th' important act, that drew ye down to earth,s finish'd. Spare we now their mortal sense,That cannot long endure th' unshrouded beamOf higher natures. Well hath Edward laid,nder your happy auspices, the baseOf his great ORDER: let him undisturb'd,But not unaided by the heav'nly powers,Compleat th' illustrious work, which future kings,Struck with the beauty of the noble plan,Shall emulously labour to maintain.And may thy spirit, Edward, be their guide!In every chapter, thou henceforth preside,In every breast infuse thy virtuous flame,And teach them to respect their country's fame.Genius and Spirits reascend to a loud sympony of musick.An Epistle to the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount CORNBURY.By — EsqWHILE you, my Lord, alas! amidst a few,With generous warmth your country's good pursue;While to the center all your wishes tend,Accept the zeal that prompts a willing friend.Others like you heaven's hallow'd spark inspir'd,Whom soon the blaze of selfish passion fir'd,Soon ruder flames extinguish'd reason's light,While prejudices foul'd their jaundic'd sight.Such thro' false opticks every object prove,And try the good and bad, by hate and love.All-powerful means each virtue to supply,All-powerful means each virtue to deny;To Wyndham strength, and grace, and fire, and weight;To Granville parts, to save a sinking state,Hence various judgments form the madden'd throng,Only in this alike, they all are wrong.Hence to false praise shall blame unjust succeed,And cherubs fall, and gods unpity'd bleed.Wou'd you, my friend, not mix the purer flame,Nor lose the patriot in a baser name;Nor factious rage mistake for publick zeal,Nor private int'rest for the gen'ral weal?By truth's sure test let ev'ry deed be try'd,And justice ever be th' unerring guide.Her rules are plain, and easy is her way,And yet how hard to find if once we stray!All lost alike the maze perplex'd we tread,However prompted, whether drove or led;Whether false honour or ambition goad,Or sneaking av'rice wind the miry road,Or whether sway'd by passions not our own,And the weak fear of being right alone.Alone in such a cause is base to fear,Tho' fools suspect, and knaves designing sneer.Sneer, villains, sneer! th' avenging time is nigh,When Balbo scourg'd shall weep the taunting lie;When Stopus foul with each imputed crime,Shall dread false prose repaid with honest rhyme.'Tis not enough you scorn a private claim,And to your country's good direct your aim.Wrong is still wrong, however great the end,Tho' all the realm were brother, father, friend;Justice regards not these—where right prevails,A nation is an atom in her scales.Heaven means not all the good which man can gain,But that which truth can earn, and right maintain.However fair the tempting prize may be,If guilt the price, it is not meant for thee.Succeeding times may claim the just design,Or other means, or other powers than thine.Each part's connected with the gen'ral plan,The weal of Britain with the weal of man.Justice the scale of interest for the whole,The same in Indies as beneath the pole;Sure rule by which heaven's blessings to dispense,Unerring light of guiding providence.Others may fail.—If wrongly understood,How fatal is the thirst of publick good!No heavier curse almighty vengeance brings,Nor plagues, nor famine, nor the lust of kings.Fir'd by this rage the frantick sons of Rome,The suff'ring world to death and bondage doom;Nations must sink to raise her cumb'rous frame,And millions bleed to eternize her name.But lo! her glories fade, her empire's past,She madly conquer'd but to fall the last.Nor would I here the patriot's views reprove,Or damp the sacred flame of social love.Still may that portion of th' eternal raySublime our sense, and animate our clay;Above low self exalt th' immortal frame,And emulate that heaven from whence it came.Oh! would it never be confin'd to place,But beam extensive as the human race:Be, as it was design'd, the world's great soul,Connect its parts, and actuate the whole,So each should think himself a part alone,And for a nation's welfare stake his own!Yet farther still, tho' dearest to the breast,That nation think but part of all the rest.For this let equal justice poise the ball,Her swaying force unites us all to all;Of manners, worship, form, no diff'rence knows,Condemns our friends, and saves our better foes.Confess the heavenly power! nor need you fearLet Britain suffer, while you follow her.Tho' prosp'rous crimes some daring villains raise,Nor life's short date my halting vengeance seize;A nation cannot 'scape — the destin'd ragePursues her ceaseless to some future age;Speeds the sure ruin from the conqueror's hand,Or spreads corruption o'er a pining land.Ask hoary time, what nation is most blest?For sage experience shall this truth attest:"Where freedom sleeps secure from lawless wrath,"Where commerce shelter'd flows thro' publick faith,"Where fell ambition lights no foreign wars,"Nor discord rages with intestine wars;"Where justice reigns."—Immortal were that state,If aught immortal here were giv'n by Fate.Such, lost Iberia! were those happy reigns,When liberty sat brooding o'er thy plains.The rich in plenteous peace their stores enjoy'd,By cares unvex'd, by luxury uncloy'd.Hope sooth'd the poor with promises of gain,And paid with future joys their present pain;Shew'd the full bowl amidst their sultry toil,While those who prun'd the olive drank the oil;By night of all the fruits of day possess'd,Labour soft-clos'd the eye, and sweeten'd rest.Such was thy state all gay in nature's smiles!And such is now the state of Britain's isles.Hence o'er the ocean's waste her sail unfurl'd,Wide wafts the tribute of a willing world.Hence trusting nations treasure here their wealth,Safe from tyrannick force or legal stealth:And hence the injur'd exile doom'd to roam,Shall find his country here and dearer home.Still be this truth, this saving truth confess'd,Britain is great, because with freedom blest;Her prince is great, because her people free,And power here springs from publick liberty.Hail mighty monarch of the free and great!Firm on the basis of a prosp'rous state.The wealth, the strength of happy millions thine,United rise, united shall decline.For time will come, sad period of the brave,When Britain's humble prince shall rule the slave;When traffick vile shall stain the guilty throne,And kings shall buy our ruin and their own.But long, O long th' inglorious doom suspend!What virtue gain'd may virtue still defend!Thrice sacred spirit, never may you cease,But as you blaz'd in war, shine forth in peace!Dauntless with all the force of truth engageThe headlong tide of each corrupted age.O ever wake around one favour'd throne,Nor let our guardian monarch wake alone!Tho' oft defeated and tho' oft betray'd,Numbers shall rise in sacred freedom's aid.Far as her all-enlivening influence reigns,Heroic ardour beats in gen'rous veins.Now bids learn'd Greece barbarian might defy,Now the soft arts of polish'd tyranny;Now to no stock, or sect, or place confin'd,She takes adopted sons from human kind;While denizen'd by her eternal laws,They all are Britons who shall serve her cause.Lo! to the banner crowds a youthful band;Form'd for the glorious task by nature's hand;Wisdom unclogg'd by years, with toil unbought,A zeal by vigour kindled, rul'd by thought.Such gifts she to the happy few imparts,To judging heads and to determin'd hearts;To heads unfir'd by youth's tumultuous rage,To hearts unnumb'd by the chill ice of age;And while they both preserve a sep'rate claim,Their passions reason, and their reasons flame.Proceed brave youths! Let others court renownIn hostile fields, be yours the olive crown:And trust to fame, those heroes brighter shoneWho sav'd a nation, than who nations won.Nor let assuming age restrain your flight,Fearful to tempt the yet unpractis'd height;Deceitful counsel lurks in hoary hairs,And the last dregs of life are sordid cares.Objects are clear proportion'd in degree,To gen'ral use, or strong necessity,Nor are two things so plainly understood,As the worst evil and the greatest good;If rescu'd from the misty breath of schools;Men will but feel without the help of rules.So unbewilder'd in the crooked maze,Where guilt low sculks, and reptile cunning strays,A nation's interest, and a people's rights,Distinctly shine in nature's simple rights,And claim in him who fairly acts his part,Before a Lonsdale's head, a Lonsdale's heart.But chief when snatch'd by heaven's preserving hand,From the fell contests of each hostile land,A happy island to th' incircling mainTrusts for a sure report and honest gain.The just are heaven's, earth is for heaven ordain'd,Form'd by its laws, and by its laws maintain'd.These one true int'rest, one great system frame,Political and moral are the same.Guilt toils for gain at honour's vast expence,Heaven throws the trifle in to innocence;And fixes happiness in hell's despite,The necessary consequence of right.Proceed, ye deists! blindfold rage employ,And prove the sacred truths ye would destroy.Prove christian faith the wisest scheme to bind,In chains of cordial love, our jarring kind;And thence conclude it human, if you can,The perfect produce of imperfect man!While prostrate we adore that pow'r divine,Whose simple rule connects each great design;Bids social earth a type of heaven appear,Where justice tastes those joys which wait her there.But tho' self-int'rest follow virtue's train!Yet selfish think not virtue's end is gain!Older than time, ere int'rest had a name,Justice existed, and is still the same;Alike the creature's and creator's guide,His rule to form, the law by which we're ty'd:In reason's light, eternal word, express'd,Stamp'd with his image in the creature's breast.Thus speaks the sage, who skill'd in nature's laws,Deep from effects high-trac'd th' all-ruling cause."Before creation was, th' almighty mind"In time's abyss the future world design'd;"Did the great system in its parts survey,"And fit the springs, and regulate their play;"In meet gradations plan'd th' harmonious round,"These links by which depending parts are bound."All these he knew, ere yet the things he made,"In types which well the mimick world display'd."The types are real, since from them he drew"The real forms of whatsoe'er we view."Made to their 'semblance, heaven and earth exist,"But they unmade eternally subsist."For if created, we must sure suppose"Some other types whence their resemblance flows;"While these on others equally depend,"Nor ever shall the long progression end."God ere it was, the future being saw,"Or blindfold made his world, and gave his law."But chance cou'd never frame the vast design,"Where countless parts in justest order join."The types eternal just proportions teach,"Greater or less, more or less perfect each."These ever present power omniscient sees,"On them he forms his ever-made decrees;"Nor can he better love what merits least,"Man than an angel, or than man a beast."Hence Reason, hence immortal Order springs,"Knowledge and Love adapted to the things,"And thence th' unerring rule of justice flows,"To act what Order prompts, and Reason shows."What man in nature's purity remain'd,"By pain untroubled, and by sin unstain'd;"Fair image of the God, and close conjoin'd,"By innate union with the heavenly mind;"In the pure splendor of substantial light,"The beam divine of Reason bless'd his sight;"Seraphick Order in its fount he view'd,"Seeing he lov'd, and loving he pursu'd;"Nor dar'd the body, passive slave, controul"The sovereign mandates of the ruling soul."But soon by sin the sacred union broke,"Man bows to earth beneath the heavy yoke."The darkling soul scarce feels a glimm'ring ray,"Shrouded in sense from her immortal day."Vengeance divine offended Order arms,"And cloaths in terrors her celestial charms."Now grosser objects heav'n-born souls possess,"Passions enslave, and servile cares oppress."Fraud, rapine, murder, guilt's long horrid train,"Distracted nature's anarchy maintain."No more pure Reason earthly minds can move,"No more can Order's charms persuasive prove."But as the moon reflecting borrowed day,"Sheds on our shadow'd world a feeble ray;"Some scatter'd beams of Reason law contains,"While Order's rule must be inforc'd by pains."Hence death's black scroll, dire tortures hence are giv'n;"Hence kings, the necessary curse of heaven."And just the doom of an avenging God,"Who spurn'd his scepter, feel the tyrant's rod."Blind by our fears we meet the ills we fly,"In rule oppression, want in property."So spoke the sage, and if not learn'd in vain,If spotless truth in sacred books remain;Dearly the child hath paid the parent's pride,And ill hath Law the heavenly rule supply'd.Thus boasts some leech with unavailing art,To mend the tainted lungs and wasting heart;Bids the loose springs with wonted vigour play,And sprightly juices warm in cold decay.Or wou'd imperious reason deign to own,The world not made for sovereign man alone;Some things there are for human use design'd,And these in common dealt to human kind.To mortal wants is giv'n a power to use,What to th' immortal part just heaven might well refuse.This faithful instinct in each breast implants,All know their rights, for all must feel their wants.But soon began the rage of wild desire,To thirst for more than use could o'er require.Ere stung by luxury's unsated call,And ere ambition madly grasp'd the ball,Vain restless man in busy search employ'd,Saw somewhat still beyond the bliss enjoy'd,Press'd eager on; the lowly and the great,Alike their wish beyond their destin'd state;Alike condemn'd, whatever Fortune grant,To real poorness in phantastic want.And now some sages high by others deem'd,For virtue honour'd, and for parts esteem'd;Call'd forth to judge where dubious claims are try'd,Convince with reason, and with counsel guide;Fix'd rules devise to sway th' assenting throng,And marks distinct impress on right and wrong.The simple precept subtle wiles invade,And statutes as our crimes increas'd were made,These were at first unwritten, plain and few,'Till swell'd by time the law's vast volume grew;And grown with these, to sway th' unwieldy trust,Thousands we chose to keep the millions just,Some plac'd o'er others, others plac'd o'er these,Thus government grew up by slow degrees;Higher the pile arose, and still more high,When lo! the summit ends in monarchy.There plac'd, a man in gorgeous pomp appears,And far o'er earth his tow'ring aspect rears;While prostrate crowds his sacred smile implore,And what their crimes had form'd, their fears adore.Low from beneath they lift their servile eyes,And see the proud colossus touch the skies.So at some mountain's foot have children gaz'd,While close to heaven they view the summit rais'd,Eager they mount, new regions to explore,But heaven is now as distant as before.Thus views the crowd a throne, while those who riseClaim not a nearer kindred to the skies;Earth is their parent, thither kings should bend,From thence they rise, and not from heaven descend.Happy, had all the royal sons of earthThus sprung, nor guilt had claim'd the monstrous birth.Where from the fire descending thro' the line,Rapine and fraud confer a right divine.Ye mortal gods, how vainly are ye proud?If just your title, servants to the crowd;If wide your sway, if large your treasur'd store,These but increase your servitude the more;A part is only yours, the rest is theirs,And nothing all your own, except your cares.Shall man, by nature free, by nature madeTo share the feast her bounteous hand display'd,Transfer these rights? as well he may dispenseThe beam of reason, or the nerve of sense;With all his strength the monarch's limbs invest,Or pour his valour in the royal breast.Take the starv'd peasant's taste, devouring lord!Ere you deprive him of the genial board.And if you wou'd his liberty controul,Assume the various actings of his soul!So shall one man a people's powers enjoy,Thus Indians deem of wretches they destroy.Thus in old tales the fabled monster stands,Proud of a thousand eyes, a thousand hands.Thus dreams the sophist, who with subtle artWou'd prove the whole included in a part,A people in their king; and from the throng,Transfer to him their rights in nature's wrong;Those sacred rights in nature's charter plain,By wants that claim them, and by powers that gain.Tho' sophists err, yet stand confess'd thy claim,And be the king and multitude the same,Whose deeds benevolent his title prove,And royal selfishness, in publick love;Nor, draining wasted realms for sordid pelf,O scepter'd suicide! destroy thy self.Where fails this proof, in vain would we uniteThe ruler's int'rest with the people's right.Frantick ambition has her sep'rate claim,The dropsy'd thirst of empire, wealth, or fame;Pride's boundless hope, valour's enthusiast rant,With the long nameless train of fancy'd want.Urg'd on by these, all view the magick prize,The prospect widening as they higher rise;For him who seeks a limited command,To him whose wish devours air, sea, and land.Alike all foes to freedom's holy cause,For freedom ties unbounded will with laws,Alike all foes to ev'ry publick gain,For publick blessings loose the bond-man's chain.Ill-fated slaves of arbitrary sway!Where trusted power seduces to betray;Makes private failings rage a gen'ral pest,And taints even virtue in the social breast;Bids friendship plunder, charity undoThe blameless MANY, for the favour'd FEW.'Till guilt high rear'd on crimes protecting crime,Fills the heap'd measure of predestin'd time.Far others, ye, O wealthy, wise, and brave!Tho' subject, free; more freedom wou'd enslave.Bless'd with a rule by long experience try'd,Unwarp'd by faction's rage, or kingly pride;Bless'd with the means, whene'er this rule shall bend,Again to trace it to its glorious end;And bless'd with proofs, the proofs are seal'd with blood,Whate'er the form, the end is publick good.But yet admit the sire his right fore-goes!Can he his children's separate claim dispose?Whate'er the parent gave, whate'er he give,They who have right to life, have right to live.And spite of man's consent, or man's decree,A right to life, is right to liberty.Tho' for convenience fram'd the laws should shine,Pure emanation from the source divine;Such as can pierce the gloom of pagan night,And untaught savages in woods enlight;Such as on scaffolds can the guiltless save,And torture on his throne the scepter'd slave;Such as th' offending wretch reluctant owns,And hails its beauty with his dying groans:In such fair laws the will of heaven impress'd,Shines to all eyes, and rules the conscious breast.Tho' tortures cease, tho' night's thick-mantling vailFrom mortal ken the secret deed conceal;Reason and conscience shall awake within,And light the shade, and loud proclaim the sin."But should the universal voice combine,"To cloath injustice in a robe divine?"Let the same breath divest the day of light,To blazon forth the dusky face of night.Then shall the laws of sainted evil bind,And human will subvert th' all-ruling mind;That sacred fount whence lawful rule must spring,And diff'rent from the robber marks the king.Yet vainly wou'd despotick will conclude,That force may sway the erring multitude,Justice, 'tis own'd, should ever guide the free,But pow'r of wrong, in all, is liberty;And for whatever purposes restrain'd,A nation is enslav'd that may be chain'd.Heaven gives to all a liberty of choice,A people's good requires a people's voice;Man's surest guide, where diff'rent views agree,From private hate, and private int'rest free.Fatal their change from such who rashly fly,To the hard grasp of guiding tyranny;Soon shall they find, when will is arm'd with might,Injustice wield the sword, tho' drawn for right.Blind to these truths who fond of boundless sway,Bids trembling slaves implicitly obey;Tho' by a long descent from Adam downThro' scepter'd heirs, he boasts his ancient crown,Great nature's rebel forfeits ev'ry claim,And loads the tyrant with th' usurper's name;While with each lawless act of proud command,He stands proscrib'd by his own guilty hand.Bow, Filmer, bow! to hell's tremendous throne,And bid thy fellow-damn'd suppress each groan!There sits a king whom pow'r divine hath giv'n,Nor earth boasts one so surely sent from heav'n.And thou, blest martyr in fair freedom's cause,Thou great asserter of thy country's laws;Vainly oppression stopp'd thy potent breath;Truth shone more powerful thro' the vail of death;Example mov'd whom precept cou'd not save,And lifted axes wak'd each drowsy slave.Yet magistrates must rule, they're useful things,Our guilt the vengeance, and avenger brings.Whate'er more perfect heaven might first create,A state well-governed, now, is nature's state;For law from reason springs, spontaneous fruit,And reason sure is man's first attribute.Let visionary schoolmen toil in vain,Who seek in anarchy for nature's reign;Wretched alike the slaves of lawless will,Whether the savage, or the tyrant kill;Unjust alike all rule, where publick choiceSpeaks not thro' laws a willing people's voice.Nor freedom suffers when the guilty fall,'Tis nature's doom, 'tis self-defence in all.Such now is man deprav'd that fear must sway,To tread the paths where duty points the way;The wretch must suffer to forewarn the rest,And some must fall to stop the spreading pest.Alone the gen'ral welfare can demandThe bleeding victim from th' unwilling hand.Hence publick pains—what to the crime is due,O Judge supreme! must be reserv'd for you.To you alone, whose all-pervading eyeDeep in the breast can latent thought espy;Try ev'ry action by the known intent,And to each crime adapt its punishment;While men, misled by erring lights, dispenseThe doom of guilt to injur'd innocence;Or tho' repentance cleanse the moral stain,Inflict on crimes atton'd avenging pain.Yet blameless they who act sincere their part,Faultless he errs who cannot read the heart.Not such fierce flames the mad enthusiast's zeal,On errors harmless to the gen'ral weal,Whether false notions wander far from truth,Or age retain'd the trace impress'd in youth.While int'rest prompts the holy murd'rer's hand,In sacred fires to light th' unhallow'd brand;To draw destruction from heaven's saving page,And bid sweet mercy breathe relentless rage.Accurs'd all such! and he with joy elate,Whose baleful breath embitters certain fate;Who on th' imploring face malignant smiles,And sentenc'd wretches wantonly reviles.Better, far better in the savage den,Let the robb'd lion judge o'er prostrate men:Better let pow'r the lawless faulchion draw,Than coward cruelty disgrace the law.This well you know, O —! whose righteous seatGives to the innocent a sure retreat;Severely just, and piously humane,The wretch you punish, while you share his pain.Tears with the dreadful words of sentence flow,Nor does the rigid judge the man forego.So feels the breast humane, ye truly brave!And such is thine, my friend, intent to save!Whether thy bounty pining want relieve,Or lenient pity sooth the hearts that grieve;Whether thy pious hand due bounds prescribeTo little tyrants, o'er the lesser tribe;Or whether noble warmth expand thy soul,And huge leviathan unaw'd controul.Nor Britain only claims thy gen'rous plan,Thy rule is justice, and thy care is man.And may this truth thy fair example prove,Justice shall fan the flame of social love.An EPISTLE.By the Same.THro' the wild maze of life's still varying plan,Bliss is alone th' important task of man.All else is trifling, whether grave or gay,A Newton's labours, or an infant's play;Whether this vainly wastes th' unheeded sun,Or those more vainly mark the course it run;For of the two, sure smaller is the fault,To err unthinking, than to err with thought;But if, like them, we still must trifles use,Harmless at least, like theirs, be those we chuse.Enough it is that reason blames the choice,Join not to her's the wretch's plaintive voice;Be folly free from guilt: let foplings play,Or write, or talk, or dress, or die away.Let those, if such there be, whose giant-mindSuperior tow'rs above their pigmy kind,Unaided and alone, the realms explore,Where hail and snow renew their treasur'd store. Joh, chap. xxxviii.Lo! heav'n spreads all its stars; let those explain,What balanc'd pow'rs the rolling orb sustain;Nor in more humble scales, pernicious weighSense, justice, truth, against seducing pay.So distant regions shall employ their thought,And spotless senates here remain unbought.Well had great Charles V. Emperor of Germany, who in his retirement amus'd himself with puppets. See Strada de bello Belgico. Charles, by early want inspir'd,With warring puppets, guiltless praise acquir'd;So wou'd that flame have mimick fights engag'd,Which fann'd by pow'r, o'er wasted nations rag'd.Curs'd be the wretch, should all the mouths of fameWide o'er the world his deathless deeds proclaim,Who like a baneful comet spreads his blaze,While trembling crowds in stupid wonder gaze;Whose potent talents serve his lawless will,Which turns each virtue to a publick ill,With direful rage perverted might employs,And heav'n's great ends with heav'n's best means destroys.The praise of power is his, whose hand suppliesFire to the bold, and prudence to the wise;While man this only real merit knows,Fitly to use the gifts which heaven bestows:If savage valour be his vaunted fame,The mountain-lion shall dispute his claim:Or, if perfidious wiles deserve applause,Thro' slighted vows, and violated laws;The subtle plotter's title stands confess'd,Whose dagger gores the trusting tyrant's breast.And sure the villain less deserves his fate,Who stabs one wretch, than he who stabs a state.Now, mighty hero! boast thy dear delights,The price of toilsome days and sleepless nights;Say, canst thou aught in purple grandeur find,Sweet as the slumbers of the lowly hind?Better are ye, the youthful and the gay,Who jocund rove thro' pleasure's flow'ry way!Yet seek not there for bliss! your toil were vain,(And disappointed toil is double pain)Tho' from the living fount your nectar-bowlsPour the soft balm upon your thirsty souls;Tho' pure the spring, tho' every draught sincere,By pain unbitter'd, and unpall'd by fear;Tho' all were full as high as thought can soar,Till fancy fires, and wishes crave no more:Let lovely woman artless charms display,Where truth and goodness bask in beauty's ray;Let heavn'ly melody luxuriant floatIn swelling sounds, and breathe the melting note;Let gen'rous wines enliv'ning thoughts inspire,While social converse sooths the genial fire:If aught can yet more potent charms dispense,Some stronger rapture, some sublimer sense;Be these enjoy'd.—Then from the crowd ariseSome chief, in life's full pride maturely wise.Ev'n you, my Lord, with titles, honours grac'd,And higher still by native merit plac'd;By stinted talents to no sphere confin'd,Free ranging every province of the mind:Equally fit, a nation's weight to bear,Or shine in circles of the young and fair;In grave debates instructed senates move,Or melt the glowing dame to mutual love.To heighten these, let conscious worth infuseSweet ease, and smiling mirth th' inspiring Muse.Then answer, thou of ev'ry gift possess'd,Say, from thy soul, art thou sincerely blest!To various subjects wherefore dost thou range?Pleasure must cease, ere man can wish to change.Hast thou not quitted Flaccus' sacred lay,To talk with Bavius, or with Flavia play;When wasted nature shuns the large expenceOf deep attention to exalted sense!Precarious bliss! which soon, which oft must cloy,And which how few, how very few enjoy!Say, is there aught, on which, completely blest,Fearless and full the raptur'd mind may rest?Is there aught constant? Or, if such there be,Can varying man be pleas'd with constancy?Mark then what sense the blessing must employ!The senses change, and loath accustom'd joy:Eden in vain immortal sweets displays,If the taste sickens, or our frame decays.The range of life contracted limits bound;Yet more confin'd is pleasure's faithless round:Fair op'ning to the sight, when first we run,But, ah! how alter'd, when again begun!When tir'd we view the same known prospect o'er,And lagging, tread the steps we trod before.Now clogg'd with spleen, the lazy current flows,Thro' doubts, and fears, and self-augmenting woes;Till sated, loathing, hopeless here of bliss,Some plunge to seek it into death's abyss.Of all superfluous wealth's unnumber'd stings,The sharpest is that knowledge which it brings;Enjoyment purchas'd makes its object known,And then, alas! each soft illusion's flown:Love's promis'd sweet, ambition's lofty scheme,The painter's image, and the poet's theme.These, in perspective fair exalted high,Attract with seeming charms the distant eye;But when by envious Fortune plac'd too near,Mis-shapen forms, and grosser tints appear:Where lovely Venus led her beauteous train,Some fiend gigantic holds her monstrous reign;Crowns, scepters, laurels are confus'dly strow'd,A wild, deform'd, unmeaning, heavy load.Some pleasures here with sparing hand are giv'n,That sons of earth should taste their promis'd heav'n:But what was meant to urge us to the chace,Now stops, or sideway turns our devious race:Tho' still to make the destin'd course more plain,Thick are our erring paths beset with pain;Nor has one object equal charms to proveThe fitting center of our restless love.And when the great Creator's will had join'd,Unequal pair! the body and the mind,Lest the proud spirit should neglect her clay,He bad corporeal objects thought convey;Each strong sensation to the soul impartEcstatic transport or afflicting smart:By that entic'd, the useful she enjoys;By this deterr'd, she flies whate'er destroys:Hence from the dagger's point sharp anguish flows,And the soft couch is spread with sweet repose.In something frail, tho' gen'ral this design,For some exceptions ev'ry rule confine:Yet few were they, while nature's genuine storeSupply'd our wants, nor man yet sought for more;Ere diff'rent mixtures left no form the same,And vicious habits chang'd our sickly frame.Now subtle art may gild the venom'd pill,And bait with soothing sweets destructive ill.To narrow self heav'n's impulse unconfin'dDiffusive reigns, and takes in all our kind.The smile of joy reflected joy imparts;The wretch's groans pierce sympathizing hearts.Yet not alike are all conjoin'd with all,Nor throng with rival heat to nature's call:By varying instinct different ties are known,While love superior points to each his own;Those next the reach of our assisting hands,And those to whom we're link'd by kindred bands;Those who most want, and best deserve our care,In warmer streams the sacred influence share;Ambrosial sweets her infant's lip distils,While through the mother's heart quick rapture thrills.The social fires friend, servant, neighbour claim,Which blaze collected in the patriot's flame:Hence Britain throbs superior in thy soul,Nor idly wak'st thou for the distant pole.Yet farther still the saving instinct moves,And to the future wide extends our loves;Glows in our bosom for an unborn race,And warms us mutual to the kind embrace,For this, to man was giv'n the graceful air;For this, was woman form'd divinely fair.But now to pleasure sensual views confin'd,Reach not the use, for which it was design'd;To this one point our hopes, our wishes tend,And thus mistake the motive for the end.Whate'er sensations from enjoyment flow,Our erring thought to matter's force would owe;To that ascribe our pleasures and our pains,And blindly for the cause mistake the means;In od'rous meads the vernal gale we praise,Or dread the storm, that blows the wintry seas;While he's unheeded, who alone can move,Claims all our fears, and merits all our love;Alone to souls can sense and thought convey,Thro' the dark mansions of surrounding clay.Man, part from heav'n, and part from humble earth,A motley substance, takes his various birth;Close link'd to both, he hangs in diff'rent chains,The pliant fetter length'ning as he strains.If, bravely conscious of her native fires,To the bold height his nobler frame aspires;Near as she soars to join th' approaching skies,Our earth still lessens to her distant eyes.But if o'erpois'd she sinks, her downward courseEach moment weighs, with still augmenting force;Low and more low, the burden'd spirit bends,While weaker still each heav'nly link extends;Till prostrate, grov'ling, fetter'd to the ground,She lies in matter's heap o'erwhelm'd and bound.Wrapt in the toils of sin, just heav'n employsWhat caus'd her guilt, to blast her lawless joys:Love, potent guardian of our length'ning race,Unnerves the feeble lecher's cold embrace;And appetite, by nature giv'n to save,Sinks the gorg'd glutton in his early grave.What sends yon fleet o'er boist'rous seas to roll,Beneath the burning line, and frozen pole?Why ravage men the hills, the plains, the woods?Why spoil all nature, earth, and air, and floods?Seek they some prize to help a sinking state,No!—this must all be done, ere A Frenchman render'd famous by a most extravagant expence in eating. Bernard eat.Tell it some untaught savage! with surprizeHe asks, "How vast must be that giant's size!"How great his pow'r, who thousands can employ?"How great his force, who millions can destroy?"But if the savage would, more curious, knowWhat potent virtues from such viands flow,What blest effects they cause—consult with Sloane,Let him explain the colick, gout, and stone!Pleasure's for use; it differs in degree,Proportion'd to the thing's necessity.Hence various objects variously excite,And diff'rent is the date of each delight;But when th' allotted end we once attain,Each step beyond it, is a step to pain.Nor let us murmur.—Hath not earth a storeFor ev'ry want? it was not meant for more.Blest is the man, as far as earth can bless,Whose measur'd passions reach no wild excess;Who, urg'd by nature's voice, her gifts enjoys,Nor other means, than nature's force, employs.While warm with youth the sprightly current flows,Each vivid sense with vig'rous rapture glows;And when he droops beneath the hand of age,No vicious habit stings with fruitless rage;Gradual, his strength, and gay sensations cease,While joys tumultuous sink in silent peace.Far other is his lot, who, not contentWith what the bounteous care of nature meant,With labour'd skill would all her joys dilate,Sublime their sense, and lengthen out their date;Add, blend, compose, each various mixture try,And wind up appetite to luxury.Thus guilty art unknown desires implants,And viler arts must satisfy their wants;When to corruption by himself betray'd,Gold blinds the slave, whom luxury has made.The hand, that form'd us, must some use intend,It gives us pow'rs proportion'd to that end;And happiness may justly be defin'd,A full attainment of the end design'd.Virtue and wisdom this alike implies,And blest must be the virtuous and the wise.Bliss is ordain'd for all, since heav'n intendsAll beings should attain their destin'd ends:For this the fair idea shines confess'dTo ev'ry mind, and glows in ev'ry breast.Compar'd with this, all mortal joys are vain;Inspir'd by this, we restless onward strain.High tho' we mount, the objects mount more high,Eludes our grasp, and mingles with the sky.With nothing less th' aspiring soul's content,For nothing less her gen'rous flame was meant;Th' unerring rule, which all our steps should guide,The certain test, by which true good is try'd.Blest when we reach it, wretched while we miss,Our joys, our sorrows prove, there must be bliss.Nor can this be some visionary dream,Where heated fancy forms the flatt'ring scheme.There sure is bliss—else, why by all desir'd?What guileful pow'r has the mad search inspir'd?Could accident produce in all the same,Or a vain shadow raise a real flame?When nature in the world's distended space,Or fill'd, or almost fill'd each smaller place;Careful in meanest matter to produceEach single motion for some certain use;Hard was the lot of her first fav'rite, man,Faulty the scheme of his contracted span,If that alone must know an useless void,And he feel longings ne'er to be enjoy'd.That only can produce consummate joy,Which equals all the pow'rs it would employ;Such fitting object to each talent giv'n,Earth cannot fit what was design'd for heav'n.Why then is man with gifts sublimest fraught,And active will and comprehensive thought?For what is all this waste of mental force?What! for a house, a coach, a dog, a horse?Has nature's lord inverted nature's plan?Is man now made for what was made for man?There must be pleasures past the reach of sense,Some nobler source must happiness dispense:Reason, arise! and vindicate thy claim,Flash on our minds the joy-infusing flame;Pour forth the fount of light, whose endless storeThought drinks insatiate, while it thirsts for more.And thou, seraphick flame! who would'st inspireThe prophet's voice, and wrap his soul in fire;Ray of th' eternal beam! who canst pervadeThe distant past, and future's gloomy shade;While trembling reason tempts heav'n's dazzling height,Sublime her force, and guide her dubious flight;Strengthen'd by thee, she bears the streaming blaze,And drinks new light from truth's immortal rays.Great, only evidence of things divine!By thee reveal'd, the mystick wonders shine!What puzzled sophists vainly would explore,What humbled pride in silence must adore,What plainly mark'd in heav'n's deliver'd page,Makes the taught hind more wise than Greece's sage.Yet reason proves thee in her low degree,And owns thy truths, from their necessity.Conspicuous now is happiness display'd,Possessing him for whom alone we're made.For he alone all human bliss compleats,To him alone th' expanding bosom beats;Who fills each faculty, each pow'r can move,Exerts all thought, and deep absorbs all love;Whose ceaseless being years would tell in vain,Whose attributes immense all bounds disdain.No sickly taste the heav'nly rapture cloys,Nor wearied senses sink in whelming joysWhile, rais'd above low matter's grosser frame,Pure spirit blazes in his purer flame.Such are th' immortal blessings that attendThe just and good, the patriot and the friend.Nor such alone in distant prospect cheer,They taste heav'n's joys anticipated here.These in the smiling cups of pleasure flow,Or, mingling, sooth the bitter stream of woe;These pay the loss of honours, and of place,And teach that guilt alone is true disgrace;These with the glorious exile cheerful rove,And, far from courts, fresh bloom in Curio's grove.Long may such bliss, by such enjoy'd, attest,The greatly virtuous are the greatly blest!Enough there are amidst yon gorgeous train,Who, wretched, prove all other joys are vain.So shines the truth these humble lines unfold,"Fair virtue ever is unwisely sold."Too mean a price sublimest fortune brings,Too mean the wealth, the smiles, the crowns of kingsFor rais'd o'er these, she makes our bliss secure,The present pleasing, and the future sure.While prosp'rous guilt a sad reverse appears,And in the tasteless now, the future fears.An EPISTLE to a LADY.By the Same.CLarinda, dearly lov'd, attendThe counsels of a faithful friend;Who with the warmest wishes fraught,Feels all, at least, that friendship ought.But since by ruling heav'n's design,Another's fate shall influence thine;O! may these lines for him prepareA bliss, which I wou'd die to share!Man may for wealth or glory roam,But woman must be blest at home;To this shou'd all her studies tend,This her great object and her end.Distaste unmingled pleasures bring,And use can blunt affliction's sting;Hence perfect bliss no mortals know,And few are plung'd in utter woe;While nature arm'd against despair,Gives pow'r to mend, or strength to bear;And half the thought content may gain,Which spleen employs to purchase pain.Trace not the fair domestick plan,From what you wou'd, but what you can!Nor, peevish, spurn the scanty score,Because you think you merit more!Bliss ever differs in degree,Thy share alone is meant for thee;And thou should'st think, however small,That share enough, for 'tis thy all:Vain scorn will aggravate distress,And only make that little less.Admit whatever trifles come,Units compose the largest sum:O! tell them o'er, and say how vainAre those which form ambition's train:Which swell the monarch's gorgeous state,And bribe to ill the guilty great!But thou more blest, more wise than these,Shalt build up happiness on ease.Hail sweet Content! where joy sereneGilds the mild soul's unruffled scene:And with blith fancy's pencil wrought,Spreads the white web of flowing thought;Shines lovely in the cheerful face,And cloaths each charm with native grace;Effusion pure of bliss sincere,A vestment for a god to wear.Far other ornaments composeThe garb that shrouds dissembled woes,Piec'd out with motley dies and sorts,Freaks, whimsies, festivals and sports;The troubled mind's fantastick dress,Which madness titles happiness.While the gay wretch to revel bearsThe pale remains of sighs and tears;And seeks in crowds, like her undone,What only can be found in one.But, chief, my gentle friend! removeFar from thy couch seducing love!O! shun the false magician's art,Nor trust thy yet unguarded heart!Charm'd by his spells fair honour flies,And thousand treach'rous phantoms riseWhere guilt in beauty's ray beguiles,And ruin lurks in friendship's smiles.Lo! where th' enchanted captive dreamsOf warbling groves, and purling streams;Of painted meads, of flowers that shedTheir odours round her fragrant bed.Quick shifts the scene, the charm is lost,She wakes upon a desert coast!No friendly hand to lend its aid,No guardian bow'r to spread its shade;Expos'd to ev'ry chilling blast,She treads th' inhospitable waste;And down the drear decline of life,Sinks a forlorn, dishonour'd wife.Neglect not thou the voice of Fame,But clear from crime, be free from blame!Tho' all were innocence within,'Tis guilt to wear the garb of sin.Virtue rejects the foul disguise:None merit praise who praise despise.Slight not, in supercilious strain,Long practis'd modes, as low or vain!The world will vindicate their cause,And claim blind faith in custom's laws.Safer with multitudes to stray,Than tread alone a fairer way;To mingle with the erring throng,Than boldly speak ten millions wrong.Beware of the relentless trainWho forms adore, whom forms maintain!Lest prudes demure, or coxcombs loud,Accuse thee to the partial crowd;Foes who the laws of honour slight,A judge who measures guilt by spite.Behold the sage Aurelia stand,Disgrace and fame at her command!As if heaven's delegate design'd,Sole arbiter of all her kind.Whether she try some favour'd piece,By rules devis'd in ancient Greece;Or whether modern in her flight,She tells what Paris thinks polite.For much her talents to advance,She study'd Greece, and travell'd France.There learn'd the happy art to please,With all the charms of labour'd ease;Thro' looks and nods with meaning fraught,To teach what she was never taught.By her each latent spring is seen,The workings foul of secret spleen;The guilt that sculks in fair pretence,Or folly veil'd in specious sense.And much her righteous spirit grieves,When worthlessness the world deceives;Whether the erring crowd commendsSome patriot sway'd by private ends;Or husband trust a faithless wife,Secure in ignorance from strife.Averse she brings their deeds to view,But justice claims the rig'rous due;Humanely anxious to produceAt least some possible excuse.O ne'er may virtue's dire disgracePrepare a triumph for the base!Mere forms the fool implicit sway,Which witlings with contempt survey,Blind folly no defect can see,Half wisdom views but one degree;The wise remoter uses reach,Which judgment and experience teach.Whoever wou'd be pleas'd and please,Must do what others do with ease.Great precept undefin'd by rule,And only learn'd in custom's school;To no peculiar form confin'd,It spreads thro' all the human kind;Beauty and wit and worth supplies,Yet graceful in the good and wise.Rich with this gift and none beside,In fashion's stream how many glide?Secure from ev'ry mental woe,From treach'rous friend or open foe;From social sympathy that sharesThe publick loss or private cares;Whether the barb'rous foe invade,Or merit pine in fortune's shade.Hence gentle Anna ever-gay,The same to-morrow as to-day,Save where perchance, when others weep,Her cheek the decent sorrow steep;Save when perhaps a melting tale,O'er ev'ry tender breast prevail.The good, the bad, the great, the small,She likes, she loves, she honours all.And yet if sland'rous malice blame,Patient she yields a sister's fame.Alike if satire or if praise,She says whate'er the circle says;Implicit does whate'er we do,Without one point or wish in view,Sure test of others, faithful glassThro' which the various phantoms pass.Wide blank, unfeeling when alone,No care, no joy, no thought her own.Not thus succeeds the peerless dame,Who looks, and talks, and acts for fame;Intent, so wide her cares extend,To make the universe her friend.Now with the gay in frolick shines,Now reasons deep with deep divines.With courtiers now extols the great,With patriots sighs o'er Britain's fate.Now breathes with zealots holy fires,Now melts in less refin'd desires.Doom'd to exceed in each degree,Too wise, too weak, too proud, too free,Too various for one single word,The high sublime of deep absurd.While ev'ry talent nature grants,Just serves to shew how much she wants.Altho' in — combineThe virtues of our sex and thine:Her hand restrains the widow's tears,Her sense informs, and sooths and cheers;Yet like an angel in disguise,She shines but to some favour'd eyes;Nor is the distant herd allow'dTo view the radiance thro' the cloud.But thine is ev'ry winning art,Thine is the friendly honest heart:And shou'd the gen'rous spirit flow,Beyond where prudence fears to go;Such sallies are of nobler kind,Than virtues of a narrow mind.An EPISTLE to Mr. POPE.By the Same.HEAVEN in the human breast implantsFit appetites for all our wants;With hunger prompts to strength'ning food,With love of praise to publick good;These to their object straight convey,While reason winds her tardy way.Yet in one center should unite,Faith, instinct, reason, appetite:One perfect plan ordain'd to trace,And nature dignify with grace;In one great system meant to roll,To move, support, and guide the whole.But some there are who rigid blameThe mind that thirsts for righteous fame;And with weak lights presumptuous scanThe springs which move predestin'd man.And some there are, accurs'd their art,Tho' all the nine their charms impart,Who in false forms of great and just,Cloath av'rice, treachery, rage and lust:As if superior beings suitThose attributes which sink the brute.But vainly chime the partial lays,Chaste Fame rejects all spurious praise.She, fairest offspring of the skies,The goddess of the brave and wise,Whose sacred impulse prompts the bestTo succour and preserve the rest,Is deaf to ev'ry private call,And wakes but at the voice of all.From heaps of ill-collected gain,From hecatombs by heroes slain,From courts where guilty greatness dwells,She flys to penury and cells;With Erskine, pious exile, goes,To sooth a drooping father's woes;Or mingling with the orphan-train,She sings the bounties of Germain.Nor pow'r, nor policy of state,Can ever give intrinsick weight:And shou'd fallacious art displayO'er titled dross a golden ray,Still baser thro' detecting years,The speckled counterfeit appears.But when from proof, far issuing forth,The ore asserts its native worth;Then, sov'reign bard, 'tis justly thineTo stamp the well-attested coin;And consecrated with thy name,To treasure in the stores of Fame.EPISTLE to POLLIO, from the Hills of HOWTH in IRELAND.By the Same.POLLIO! would'st thou condescendHere to see thy humble friend,Far from doctors, potions, pills,Drinking health on native hills;Thou the precious draught may'st share,Lucy shall the bowl prepare.From the brousing goat it flows,From each balmy shrub that grows;Hence the kidling's wanton fire,Hence the nerves that brace his fire.Vigorous, buxom, young and gay,Thou like them shalt love and play.What, tho' far from silver Thames,Stately piles, and courtly dames?Here we boast a purer flood,Joys that stream from sprightly blood;Here is simple beauty seen,Fair, and cloath'd like beauty's queen:Nature's hands the garbs compose,From the lilly and the rose.Or, if charm'd with richer dies,Fancy every robe supplies.Shou'd perchance some high-born fair,Absent, claim thy tender care;Here, enraptur'd shalt thou trace,S—'s shape, and R—'s face;While the waking dream shall pay,Many a wishing hopeless day.Domes with gold and toil unbought,Rise by magick pow'r of thought,Where by artist's hand undrawn,Slopes the vale, and spreads the lawn;As if sportive nature meant,Here to mock the works of Kent.Come, and with thee bring alongJocund tale and witty song,Sense to teach, and words to move,Arts that please, adorn, improve;And, to gild the glorious scene,Conscience spotless and serene.Poor with all a H—t's store,Lives the man who pines for more.Wretched he who doom'd to roam,Never can be blest at home;Nor retire within his mind,From th' ungrateful and unkind.Happy they whom crowds befriend,Curs'd who on the crowd depend;On the great one's peevish fit,On the coxcomb's spurious wit;Ever sentenc'd to bemoanOthers failings in their own.If, like them, rejecting ease,Hills and health no longer please;Quick descend!—Thou may'st resortTo the viceroy's splendid court.There, indignant, shalt thou seeCringing slaves, who might be free,Brib'd, with titles, hope, or gain,Tye their country's shameful chain;Or, inspir'd by heav'n's good cause,Waste the land with holy laws:While the gleanings of their power,Lawyers, lordlings, priests devour.Now, methinks, I hear thee say,"Drink alone thy mountain-whey!"Wherefore tempt the Irish shoals?"Sights like these are nearer Paul's.An ODE to WILLIAM PULTNEY, EsqBy the Same.I.REMOTE from liberty and truth,By fortune's crime, my early youthDrank error's poison'd springs.Taught by dark creeds and mystick law,Wrapt up in reverential awe,I bow'd to priests and kings.II.Soon reason dawn'd, with troubled sightI caught the glimpse of painful light,Afflicted and afraid.Too weak it shone to mark my way,Enough to tempt my steps to strayAlong the dubious shade.III.Restless I roam'd, when from afarLo HOOKER shines! the friendly starSends forth a steady ray.Thus cheer'd, and eager to pursue,I mount, till glorious to my view,LOCKE spreads the realms of day.IV.Now warm'd with noble SIDNEY'S page,I pant with all the patriot's rage;Now wrapt in PLATO'S dream,With MORE and HARRINGTON aroundI tread fair Freedom's magick ground,And trace the flatt'ring scheme.V.But soon the beauteous vision flies;And hideous spectres now arise,Corruption's direful train:The partial judge perverting laws,The priest forsaking virtue's cause,And senates slaves to gain.VI.Vainly the pious artist's toilWould rear to heaven a mortal pile,On some immortal plan;Within a sure, tho' varying date,Confin'd alas! is every stateOf empire and of man.VII.What tho' the good, the brave, the wise,With adverse force undaunted rise,To break th' eternal doom!Tho' CATO liv'd, tho' TULLY spoke,Tho' BRUTUS dealt the godlike stroke,Yet perish'd fated ROME.VIII.To swell some future tyrant's pride,Good FLEURY pours the golden tideOn Gallia's smiling shores;Once more her fields shall thirst in vainFor wholsome streams of honest gain,While rapine wastes her stores.IX.Yet glorious is the great design,And such, O PULTNEY! such is thine,To prop a nation's frame.If crush'd beneath the sacred weight,The ruins of a falling stateShall tell the patriot's name.An Ode to the Right Honourable the Lord LONSDALE.By the Same.I.LONSDALE! thou ever-honour'd name,For such is sacred virtue's claim,Say, why! my noble friend!While nature sheds her balmy powersO'er hill and dale, in leaves and flowers,Say, why my joys suspend!II.Here spreads the lawn high-crown'd with wood,Here slopes the vale, there winds the floodIn many a crystal maze;The fishes sport, in silver prideSlow moves the swan, on either sideThe herds promiscuous graze.III.Or if the stiller shade you love,Here solemn nods th' imbow'ring groveO'er innocence and ease;Whether with deep reflection fraught,Or in the sprightly stream of thought,The lighter trifles please.IV.Alluding to a certain scandalous libel.And should the shaft of treacherous spleenGlance venom'd through this peaceful scene,Unheeded may it fly.Provok'd, nor tempted to repay,Tho' truth severer prompt the lay,A mean prosaic lie.V.Here with the pheasant and the hare,Unfearful of the human snare,Have statesmen pass'd a day.While far from yon forbidden gate,Pale care and lank remorse awaitTheir slow-returning prey.VI.O! blind to all the joys of life,Who seek them in the storm of strife,Destroying, or destroy'd.Less wretched they, and yet unbless'd,Who batten in lethargic rest,On blessings unenjoy'd.VII.But come, my friend, the sun invites,For thee the town hath no delights,Distasted and aggriev'd;While fools believe, while villains cheat,Too honest to approve deceit,Too wise to be deceiv'd.VIII.Or dost thou fear lest dire diseaseAgain thy tortur'd frame may seize;And hast thou therefore stay'd?O! rather haste, where thou shalt findA ready hand, a gentle mind,To comfort and to aid.IX.And while by sore afflictions try'd,You bear without the Stoic's pride,What Stoic never bore;O! may I learn like thee to bear,And what shall be my destin'd share,To suffer, not explore.An ODE.By the Same.GENTLE, idle, trifling boy,Sing of pleasures, sing of joy!Well you paint the crystal spring,Well the flow'ry meadow sing.But beware with bolder flight,Tempt not heaven's unequal height;But beware! with impious strain,Mock not freedom's hallow'd train!Sacred, here, O! ever beHeaven, and heaven-born liberty!Let the slaves of lawless sway,Let the stupid flock obey!Pent within a narrow fold,Ty'd, and stript, and slain, and sold.Happier stars the brave befriend,Britons know a nobler end.Theirs it is to temper laws,Theirs to watch in freedom's cause,Theirs one common good to share,Theirs to feel one common care;In the glorious task combin'd,From the monarch to the hind.Yet O! cease not gentle boy!Sing of pleasures, sing of joy!Like thy brothers of the wing,Idly hop, and chirp, and sing.Heaven can nothing vain produce,Ev'ry creature has its use.Thine it is to sooth our toil,Thine to make e'en wisdom smile.Much they err who such despise,Trifles please the truly wise.An ODE.By the Same.I.ON Stow, the Muse's happy theme,Let fancy's eye enamour'd gaze;Where thro' one nobly simple scheme,Ten thousand varying beauties please.There patriot-virtue rears her shrine,Nor love! art thou depriv'd of thine.II.Mark where from POPE'S exhaustless vein,Pure flows the stream of copious thought,While nature pours the genial strain,With fairest springs of learning fraught;The treasures of each clime and age,Grace and enrich his sacred page.III.So while thro' Britain's fields her ThamesProlifick rolls his silver tide;The tribute of a thousand streamsSwells the majestick river's pride;And where his gen'rous current strays,The wealth of either world conveys.IV.Far other, is that wretch's song,Whose scanty rill devoid of force,With idle tinklings creeps along,A narrow, crooked, dubious course;Or foul with congregated floods,Spreads a wide waste o'er plains, and woods.V.In action thus the mind express'dHigh soars in Pope the true sublime;A Stow unfolds a Cobham's breast,A Bavius crawls in doggrel rhyme.Thro' all their various works we traceThe greatly virtuous, and the base.An ODE.By the Same.I.TOO anxious for the publick weal,Awhile suspend the toilsome strife!O think if Britain claim thy zeal,Thy friends and Britain claim thy life!II.Thy gen'rous, free, and active soul,Inspir'd by glory's sacred flame,Springs ardent to the distant goal,And strains the weaker mortal frame.III.Happy whom reason deigns to guide,Secure within the golden mean,Who shuns the Stoic's senseless pride,Nor wallows with the herd obscene.IV.He nor with brow severely bent,Chides pleasure's smiling train away;Nor careless of life's great intent,With folly wastes each heedless day.V.But from the mountain's lofty height,Now nature's mighty frame surveys;And now descending with delight,Along the humble valley strays.VI.So have I seen thee gain applause,Tho' faction rag'd, from Britain's peers;Then glorious in thy country's cause,Go whisper love in Chloe's ears.An ODE to MANKIND. Address'd to the Prince.By the Same.INTRODUCTION to the PRINCE.NOR me the glories of thy birth engage,With royal names to swell my pompous page:Nor meaner views allure, in soothing laysTo court thy favour with officious praise.Yet praise it is, thus to address thine earIn strains no slave dare sing, no tyrant hear;While warm for Britain's rights and nature's laws,I call forth Britain's HOPE in freedom's cause:Assert an empire which to ALL belongs,And vindicate a world's long suffer'd wrongs.These saving truths import thee most to know,The links that tie the mighty to the low;What now, our fellow-subject, is your due,And, when our lord, shall be a debt on you.O! may'st thou to the throne such maxims bring!And feel the free-man while thou reign'st the king.Far hence the tribe, whose servile arts delude,And teach the great to spurn the multitude.Are those unworthy of the royal heir,Who claim the future monarch's duteous care?Still may thy thoughts the godlike task pursue,And to the many ne'er prefer the few!Still mayst thou fly thy fortune's specious friends,Who deal forth sov'reign grace to private ends;In narrow streams divert the copious tide,Exalt one sect, and damn the world beside;While with false lights directing partial rule,The lord of nations falls a party's tool.Such there have been—and such, in truth's despite,Disgrac'd the cause of liberty and right.But thou shalt rise superior to their arts,And fix thy empire in a people's hearts.Nor hence may faction boast her favour'd claim,Where selfish passions borow virtue's name:Free government alone preserves the free,And righteous rule is gen'ral liberty;Their guiding law is freedom's native voice,The publick good defin'd by publick choice;And justly should the bold offenders fall,Who dare invade the sov'reign rights of all;A king who proudly makes these claims his own,Or they whose rage should shake a lawful throne.From truths like these proceeds a right divine,And may the pow'r that rais'd, preserve thy scepter'd line.To MANKIND: An ODE.I.IS there, or do the schoolmen dream?Is there on earth a pow'r supreme,The delegate of heav'n?To whom an uncontroul'd command,In ev'ry realm o'er sea and land,By special grace is giv'n?II.Then say, what signs this god proclaim?Dwells he amidst the diamond's flame,A throne his hallow'd shrine?The borrow'd pomp, the arm'd array,Want, fear, and impotence betray:Strange proofs of pow'r divine!III.If service due from human kind,To men in slothful ease reclin'd,Can form a sov'reign claim:Hail monarchs! ye, whom heav'n ordains,Our toils unshar'd, to share our gains,Ye ideots, blind and lame!IV.Superior virtue, wisdom, might,Create and mark the ruler's right,So reason must conclude:Then thine it is, to whom belongThe wise, the virtuous, and the strong,Thrice sacred multitude!V.In thee, vast ALL! are these contain'd,For thee are those, thy parts ordain'd,So nature's systems roll:The scepter's thine, if such there be;If none there is, then thou art free,Great monarch! mighty whole!VI.Let the proud tyrant rest his causeOn faith, prescription, force, or laws,An host's or senate's voice!His voice affirms thy stronger due,Who for the many made the few,And gave the species choice.VII.Unsanctify'd by thy command,Unown'd by thee, the scepter'd handThe trembling slave may bind.But loose from nature's moral ties,The oath by force impos'd beliesThe unassenting mind.VIII.Thy will's thy rule, thy good its end;You punish only to defendWhat parent nature gave:And he who dare her gifts invade,By nature's oldest law is madeThy victim or thy slave.IX.Thus reason founds the just decreeOn universal liberty,Not private rights resign'd:Through various nature's wide extent,No private beings e'er were meantTo hurt the gen'ral kind.X.Thee justice guides, thee right maintains,Th' oppressor's wrong, the pilf'rer's gains,Thy injur'd weal impair.Thy warmest passions soon subside,Nor partial envy, hate, nor pride,Thy temper'd counsels share.XI.Each instance of thy vengeful rage,Collected from each clime and age,Tho' malice swell the sum,Would seem a spotless scanty scroll,Compar'd with Marius' bloody roll,Or Sylla's hippodrome.XII.But thine has been imputed blame,Th' unworthy few assume thy name,The rabble weak and loud;Or those who on thy ruins feast,The lord, the lawyer, and the priest;A more ignoble crowd.XIII.Avails it thee, if one devours,Or lesser spoilers share his pow'rs,While both thy claim oppose?Monsters who wore thy sully'd crown,Tyrants who pull'd those monsters down,Alike to thee were foes.XIV.Far other shone fair Freedom's hand,Far other was th' immortal stand,When Hampden fought for thee:They snatch'd from rapine's gripe thy spoils,The fruits and prize of glorious toils,Of arts and industry.XV.On thee yet foams the preacher's rage,On thee fierce frowns th' historian's page,A false apostate train:Tears stream adown the martyr's tomb;Unpity'd in their harder doom,Thy thousands strow the plain.XVI.These had no charms to please the sense.No graceful port, no eloquence,To win the Muse's throng:Unknown, unsung, unmark'd they lie;But Caesar's fate o'ercasts the sky,And Nature mourns his wrong.XVII.Thy foes, a frontless band, invade;Thy friends afford a timid aid,And yield up half thy right.Ev'n Locke beams forth a mingled ray,Afraid to pour the flood of dayOn man's too feeble sight.XVIII.Hence are the motly systems fram'd,Of right transfer'd, of power reclaim'd;Distinctions weak and vain.Wise Nature mocks the wrangling herd;For unreclaim'd, and untransfer'd,Her pow'rs and rights remain.XIX.While law the royal agent moves,The instrument thy choice approves,We bow through him to you.But change, or cease th' inspiring choice,The sov'reign sinks a private voice,Alike in one, or few!XX.Shall then the wretch, whose dastard heartShrinks at a tyrant's nobler part,And only dares betray;With reptile wiles, alas! prevail,Where force, and rage, and priest-craft fail,To pilfer pow'r away?XXI.O! shall the bought, and buying tribe,The slaves who take, and deal the bribe,A people's claims enjoy!So Indian murd'rers hope to gainThe pow'rs and virtues of the slain,Of wretches they destroy.XXII."Avert it, heav'n! you love the brave,"You hate the treach'rous, willing slave,"The self-devoted head."Nor shall an hireling's voice convey"That sacred prize to lawless sway,"For which a nation bled."XXIII.Vain pray'r, the coward's weak resource!Directing reason, active force,Propitious heaven bestows.But ne'er shall flame the thund'ring sky,To aid the trembling herd that flyBefore the weaker foes.XXIV.In names there dwell no magick charms,The British virtues, British armsUnloos'd our fathers' band:Say, Greece and Rome! if these shou'd fail,What names, what ancestors avail,To save a sinking land?XXV.Far, far from us such ills shall be,Mankind shall boast one nation free,One monarch truly great:Whose title speaks a people's choice,Whose sovereign will a people's voice,Whose strength a prosp'rous state.VERSES to CAMILLA.By the Same.WEARY'D with indolent repose,A life unmix'd with joys or woes;Where all the lazy moments crept,And ev'ry passion sluggish slept;I wish'd for love's inspiring pains,To rouze the loiterer in my veins.Th' officious power my call attends,He who uncall'd his succour lends;And with a smile of wanton spite,He gave Camilla to my sight.Her eyes their willing captive seize,Her look, her air, her manner please;New beauties please, unseen before,Or seen, in her they please me more;And soon, too soon, alas! I findThe virtues of a nobler kind.Now cheerful springs the morning ray,Now cheerful sinks the closing day;For every morn with her I walk'd,And every eve with her I talk'd;With her I lik'd the vernal bloom,With her I lik'd the crowded room;From her at night I went with pain,And long'd for morn to meet again.How quick the smiling moments pass,Thro' varying fancy's mimick glass!While the gay seene is painted o'er,Where all was one wide blank before:And sweetly sooth'd th' inchanting dream,Till love inspir'd a bolder scheme.Camilla, stung with grief and shame,Now marks, and shuns the guilty flame;Fierce anger lighten'd in her face,Then cold reserve assum'd its place:And soon, the wretch's hardest fate,Contempt succeeds declining hate,No more my presence now she flies,She sees me with unheeding eyes;Sees me with various passion burn,Enrag'd depart, submiss return;Return with flattering hopes to findSoft pity move her gentle mind.But ah! her looks were still the same,Unmark'd I went, unmark'd I came;Unmark'd were all my hopes and fears,While Strephon whispers in her ears.O Jealousy! distracting guest!Fly to some happy lover's breast;Fitly with joy thou minglest care,But why inhabit with despair?To CLARISSA.By the Same.'TWAS when the friendly shade of nightSuspends the busy cares of light,And on the various world bestowsOr sprightly joy, or calm repose.With gen'rous wine the glass was crown'd,And mirth, and talk, and toasts went round.Clarissa came to bless the feast,Clarissa dearly welcome guest.Not such she look'd as when by dayShe blazes in the diamond's ray;And adding to each gem a grace,Give's India's wealth the second place.But soft reclin'd in careless ease,More pleasing, less intent to please.Loose flow'd her hair in wanton pride,Her robe unbound, her zone unty'd;Half bare to view her milk-white breast,A slender veil scarce shades the rest:Her eye with sparkling lustre glows,And wit in sweetest accent flows.Now sooth'd the angel's voice I hear,And drink in love at either ear;Now stung with wilder rapture gaze,While our eyes meet with blended rays;And kindling in th' infectious flame,I feel what words want pow'r to name.Awaking from the silent trance,Cautious I steal a broken glance;In clam'rous mirth each pang disguise,And laughter swell with bursting sighs;For Envy, pallid fiend, was there,And Jealousy with watchful care.Now ends the feast, each guest retires,And with them all my soul desiresClarissa goes.—Ah! cruel fate!She goes with her ill-sorted mate:Sullen and slow he moves along,And heavy hums a drowsy song.O! drowsy may the monster lye,And instant slumbers seal his eye!So shalt thou, best belov'd, escapeThe horrors of a legal rape.Or, shou'd the brutish instinct goad,And thou must bear th' unwelcome load;If struggle, pray'r, pretence be vain,To shun what tyrant-laws ordain;Ah sparing deal out scanty dues,And keep whate'er thou canst refuse!Ah! give no bounding pulse to beat,No cheek to glow with genial heat!No breast to heave in am'rous play,No limbs to twine, no hands to stray;But sluggish press the joyless bed,And lye in cold indiff'rence dead:Nor let the blasting spoiler sip.The fragrance of thy balmy lip!To share with him the lover's part,Were rank adultery of the heart.But if, in chaster love's despite,Warm nature catch the known delight;While fierce desires tumultuous rise,And rapture melts thy closing eyes;Ah! be those joys for me design'd,And let me rush upon thy mind!To me the burning kiss impart,On me impress the humid dart,For me unlock the nectar'd store,Then sigh, and dream the transport o'er!Thus with her lov'd idea fraught,Delusive fancy charms my thought;And joining in the flatt'ring cheat,Willing I hug the dear deceit;From fiction real bliss receive,And all I fondly wish believe;Nor envy to a husband's arms,The dull fruition of her charms.But when, regardless of my truth,She smiles on some more favour'd youth;And while he whispers in her ears,With more than wonted pleasure hears;My jealous thought his voice supplies,And reads perdition in her eyes.Then torn with envy, love, and hate,I wish her with her wedded mate.An INSCRIPTION on the TOMB, Raised to the memory of the author's father, and of others his ancestors.By the Same.UNmark'd by trophies of the great and vain,Here sleeps in silent tombs a gentle train.No folly wasted their paternal store,No guilt, no sordid av'rice made it more;With honest fame, and sober plenty crown'd,They liv'd and spread their cheering influence round.May he whose hand this pious tribute pays,Receive a like return of filial praise!EPIGRAMS.By the Same.EPIGRAM I.I Lov'd thee beautiful and kind,And plighted an eternal vow;So alter'd are thy face and mind,'Twere perjury to love thee now.EPIGRAM II.SInce first you knew my am'rous smart,Each day augments your proud disdain;'Twas then enough to break my heart,And now, thank heav'n! to break my chain.Cease, thou scorner, cease to shun me!Now let love and hatred cease!Half that rigour had undone me,All that rigour gives me peace.EPIGRAM III.MY heart still hovering round about you,I thought I could not live without you;Now we have liv'd three months asunder,How I liv'd with you is the wonder.EPIGRAM IV.Upon the Bust of English worthies, at Stow.AMONG these chiefs of British race,Who live in breathing stone,Why has not COBHAM'S bust a place?The structure was his own.EPIGRAM V.THO' cheerful, discreet, and with freedom well bred,She never repented an idle word said:Securely she smiles on the forward and bold,They feel what they owe her, and feel it untold.EPIGRAM VI.LYE on! while my revenge shall be,To speak the very truth of thee.EPIGRAM VII.I Swore I lov'd, and you believ'd,Yet, trust me, we were both deceiv'd;Tho' all I swore, was true.I lov'd one gen'rous, good, and kind,A form created in my mind;And thought that form was you.EPIGRAM VIII. On Mrs. PENELOPE.THE gentle Pen with look demure,Awhile was thought a virgin pure:But Pen, as ancient poets say,Undid by night the work of day.EPIGRAM IX.On one who first abused, and then made love to a LADY.FOUL—with graceless verse,The noble—dar'd asperse.But when he saw her well bespatter'd,Her reputation stain'd and tatter'd;He gaz'd and lov'd the hideous elf,She look'd so very like himself.True sung the bard well known to fame,Self-love and social are the same.EPIGRAM X.WHILE Lucy, chaste as mountain snows,Gives every idle fop a hearing;In Mary's breast a passion glows,Which stronger is from not appearing.Say, who has chose the better part!Mary to whom no joy is missing;Or she, who dupe to her own heart,Pays the full price of Mary's kissing.EPIGRAM XI.SHE who in secret yields her heart,Again may claim it from her lover;But she who plays the trifler's part,Can ne'er her squander'd fame recover.Then grant the boon for which I pray!'Tis better lend than throw away.EPIGRAM XII.WE thought you without titles great,And wealthy with a small estate;While by your humble self alone,You seem unrated and unknown.But now on fortune's swelling tideHigh-borne, in all the pomp of pride;Of grandeur vain and fond of pelf,'Tis plain, my lord, you knew yourself.EPIGRAM XIII.LOvely shines thy wedded fair,Gentle as the yielding air;Cheering as the solar beam,Soothing as the fountain-stream.Why then, jealous husband, rail?All may breathe the ambient gale,Bask in heaven's diffusive ray,Drink the streams that pass away.All may share unless'ning joy,Why then jealous, peevish boy?Water, air, and light confine,Ere thou think'st her only thine.EPIGRAM XIV.TOM thought a wild profusion great:And therefore spent his whole estate:Will thinks the wealthy are ador'd,And gleans what misers blush to hoard.Their passion, merit, fate the same,They thirst and starve alike for fame.EPIGRAM XV.

An EPISTLE. First printed in the Year 1741.By WILLIAM WHITEHEAD, EsqQuae poterant unquam satis expurgare cicutae,Ni melius dormire putem, quam scribere versus?HOR. Ep. 2. Lib. 2.YOU ask me, sir, why thus by phantoms aw'd,No kind occasion tempts the Muse abroad?Why, when retirement sooths this idle art,To fame regardless sleeps the youthful heart?'Twou'd wrong your judgment, shou'd I fairly sayDistrust or weakness caus'd the cold delay:Hint the small diff'rence, till we touch the lyre,'Twixt real genius and too strong desire;The human slips, or seeming slips pretend,That rouze the critick, but escape the friend;Nay which, tho' dreadful when the foe pursues,You pass, and smile, and still provoke the Muse.Yet, spite of all you think, or kindly feign,My hand will tremble while it grasps the pen.For not in this, like other arts, we tryOur light excursions in a summer sky,No casual flights the dang'rous train admits,But wits once authors, are for ever wits.The fool in prose, like earth's unwieldy son,May oft rise vig'rous, tho' he's oft o'erthrown;One dangerous crisis marks our rise or fall,By all we're courted, or we're shunn'd by all.Will it avail, that unmatur'd by years,My easy numbers pleas'd your partial ears,If now condemn'd, my riper lays must bearThe wise man's censure, and the vain man's sneer?Or, still more hard, ev'n where he's valu'd most,The man must suffer if the poet's lost;For wanting wit, be totally undone,And barr'd all arts for having fail'd in one.When fears like these his serious thoughts engage,No bugbear phantom curbs the poet's rage.'Tis powerful reason holds the streighten'd rein,While flutt'ring fancy to the distant plainSends a long look, and spreads her wings in vain.But grant for once, th' officious Muse has shedHer gentlest influence on his infant head,Let fears lie vanquish'd, and resounding FameGive to the bellowing blast the poet's name.And see! distinguish'd from the crowd he moves,Each finger marks him, and each eye approves!Secure, as halcyons brooding o'er the deep,The waves roll gently, and the thunders sleep,Obsequious nature binds the tempest's wings,And pleas'd attention listens whilst he sings!O blissful state, O more than human joy!What shafts can reach him, or what cares annoy?What cares, my friend? why all that man can know,Oppress'd with real or with fancy'd woe.Rude to the world, like earth's first lord expell'd,To climes unknown, from Eden's safer field;No more eternal springs around him breathe,Black air scowls o'er him, deadly damps beneath;Now must he learn, misguided youth, to bearEach varying season of the poet's year:Flatt'ry's full beam, detraction's wintry store,The frowns of fortune, or the pride of pow'r.His acts, his words, his thoughts no more his own,Each folly blazon'd, and each frailty known.Is he reserv'd?—his sense is so refin'dIt ne'er descends to trifle with mankind.Open and free?—they find the secret causeIs vanity; He courts the world's applause.Nay, tho' he speak not, something still is seen,Each change of face betrays a fault within.If grave, 'tis spleen; he smiles but to deride;And downright aukwardness in him is pride.Thus must he steer thro' fame's uncertain seas,Now sunk by censure, and now puff'd by praise;Contempt with envy strangely mix'd endure,Fear'd where caress'd, and jealous tho' secure.One fatal rock on which good authors splitIs thinking all mankind must have their wit;And the grand business of the world stand stillTo listen to the dictates of their quill.Hurt if they fail, and yet how few succeed,What's born in leisure men of leisure read;And half of those have some peculiar whimTheir test of sense, and read but to condemn.Besides, on parties now our fame depends,And frowns or smiles, as these are foes or friends.Wit, judgment, nature join; you strive in vain;'Tis keen invective stamps the current strain.Fix'd to one side like Homer's gods, we fight,These always wrong, and those for ever right.And would you chuse to see your friend, resign'dEach conscious tie which guides the virtuous mind,Embroil'd in factions, hurl with dreadful skillThe random vengeance of his desp'rate quill?'Gainst pride in man with equal pride declaim,And hide ill-nature under virtue's name?Or deeply vers'd in flattery's wily ways,Flow in full reams of undistinguish'd praise?To vice's grave, or folly's bust bequeathThe blushing trophy, and indignant wreath?Qui nescit qualia demensAegyptus portenta colat? crocodilon adorat.JUV. Sat. 15. Like Aegypt's priests, did endless temples rise,And people with earth's pests th' offended skies?The Muse of old her native freedom knew,And wild in air the sportive wand'rer flew;On worth alone her bays eternal strow'd,And found the hero, ere she hymn'd the god.Nor less the chief his kind support return'd,No drooping Muse her slighted labours mourn'd;But stretch'd at ease she prun'd her growing wings,By sages honour'd and rever'd by kings.Ev'n knowing Greece confess'd her early claim,And warlike Latium caught the gen'rous flame.Not so our age regards the tuneful tongue,'Tis senseless rapture all, and empty song:No Pollio sheds his genial influence round,No Varus listens whilst the groves resound.Ev'n those, the knowing and the virtuous few,Who noblest ends by noblest means pursue,Forget the poet's use; the powerful spellOf magic verse, which SIDNEY paints so well,Forget that Homer wak'd the Grecian flame,That Pindar rous'd inglorious Thebes to fame,That every age has great examples givenOf virtue taught in verse, and verse inspir'd by heaven.But I forbear—these dreams no longer last,The times of fable and of flights are past.To glory now no laurel'd suppliants bend,No coins are struck, no sacred domes ascend.Yet ye, who still the Muse's charms admire,And best deserve the verse your deeds inspire,Ev'n in these gainful unambitious days,Feel for yourselves at least, ye fond of praise,And learn one lesson taught in mystic rhyme,"'Tis verse alone arrests the wings of Time."Bacon de augmentis.Fast to the thread of life, annex'd by Fame,A sculptur'd medal bears each human name,O'er Lethe's streams the fatal threads depend,The glitt'ring medal trembles as they bend;Close but the shears, when chance or nature calls,The birds of rumour catch it as it falls;Awhile from bill to bill the trifle's tost,The waves receive it, and 'tis ever lost!But should the meanest swan that cuts the streamConsign'd to Phoebus, catch the favour'd name,Safe in her mouth she bears the sacred prizeTo where bright Fame's eternal altars rise.'Tis there the Muse's friends true laurels wear,There Ptolemy Philadelphus.Aegypt's monarch reigns, and great Augustus there.Patrons of arts must live 'till arts decay,Sacred to verse in every poet's lay.Thus grateful France does Richlieu's worth proclaim,Thus grateful Britain doats on Somers' name.And, spite of party rage, and human flaws,And British liberty and British laws,Times yet to come shall sing of ANNA'S reign,And bards, who blame the measures, love the men.But why round patrons climb th' ambitious bays?Is interest then the sordid spur to praise?Persius. Shall the same cause, which prompts the chatt'ring jayTo aim at words, inspire the poet's lay?And is there nothing in the boasted claimOf living labours and a deathless name?The pictur'd front, with sacred fillets bound?The sculptur'd bust with laurels wreath'd around?The annual roses scatter'd o'er his urn,And tears to flow from poets yet unborn?Illustrious all! but sure to merit these,Demands at least the poet's learned ease.Say, can the bard attempt what's truly great,Who pants in secret for his future fate?Him serious toils, and humbler arts engage,To make youth easy, and provide for age;While lost in silence hangs his useless lyre,And tho' from heav'n it came, fast dies the sacred fire.Or grant true genius with superior forceBursts ev'ry bond, resistless in its course,Yet lives the man, how wild soe'er his aim,Would madly barter fortune's smiles for fame!Or distant hopes of future ease forego,For all the wreaths that all the Nine bestow?Well pleas'd to shine, thro' each recording page,The hapless Dryden of a shameless age?Ill-fated bard! where-e'er thy name appears,The weeping verse a sad memento bears.Ah! what avail'd th' enormous blaze betweenThy dawn of glory, and thy closing scene!When sinking nature asks our kind repairs,Unstrung the nerves, and silver'd o'er the hairs;When stay'd reflection comes uncall'd at last,And grey experience counts each folly past,Untun'd and harsh the sweetest strains appear,And loudest Paeans but fatigue the ear.'Tis true the man of verse, tho' born to ills,Too oft deserves the very fate he feels.When, vainly frequent at the great man's board,He shares in ev'ry vice with ev'ry lord:Makes to their taste his sober sense submit,And 'gainst his reason madly arms his wit;Heav'n but in justice turns their serious heartTo scorn the wretch, whose life belies his art.He, only he, should haunt the Muse's grove,Whom youth might rev'rence and grey hairs approve;Whose heav'n-taught numbers, now, in thunder roll'd,Might rouse the virtuous and appal the bold.Now, to truth's dictates lend the grace of ease,And teach instruction happier arts to please.For him would PLATO change their gen'ral fate,And own one poet might improve his state.Curs'd be their verse, and blasted all their bays,Whose sensual lure th' unconscious ear betrays;Wounds the young breast, ere virtue spreads her shield,And takes, not wins, the scarce disputed field,Tho' specious rhetoric each loose thought refine,Tho' music charm in ev'ry labour'd line,The dang'rous verse, to full perfection grown,BAVIUS might blush, and QUARLES disdain to own.Shou'd some MACHAON, whose sagacious soulTrac'd blushing nature to her inmost goal,Skill'd in each drug the varying world provides,All earth embosoms, and all ocean hides,Nor cooling herb, nor healing balm supply,Ease the swoln breast, or close the languid eye;But, exquisitely ill, awake disease,And arm with poisons ev'ry baleful breeze:What racks, what tortures must his crimes demand,The more than BORGIA of a bleeding land!And is less guilty he, whose shameless pageNot to the present bounds its subtil rage,But spreads contagion wide, and stains a future age?Forgive me, Sir, that thus the moral strain,With indignation warm'd, rejects the rein;Nor think I rove regardless of my theme,'Tis hence new dangers clog the paths to fame.Not to themselves alone such bards confineFame's just reproach for virtue's injur'd shrine;Profan'd by them, the Muse's laurels fade,Her voice neglected, and her flame decay'd.And the son's son must feel the father's crime,A curse entail'd on all the race that rhyme,New cares appear, new terrors swell the train,And must we paint them ere we close the scene?Say, must the Muse th' unwilling task pursue,And to compleat her dangers mention you?Yes you, my friend, and those whose kind regardWith partial fondness views this humble bard:Ev'n you he dreads.—Ah! kindly cease to raiseUnwilling censure, by exacting praise.Just to itself the jealous world will claimA right to judge; or give, or cancel fame.And, if th' officious zeal unbounded flows,The friend too partial is the worst of foes.Platonis Apologia. Behold th' ATHENIAN sage, whose piercing mindHad trac'd the wily lab'rinths of mankind,When now condemn'd, he leaves his infant careTo all those evils man is born to bear.Not to his friends alone the charge he yields,But nobler hopes on juster motives builds;Bids e'en his foes their future steps attend,And dare to censure, if they dar'd offend.Wou'd thus the poet trust his offspring forth,Or bloom'd our BRITAIN with ATHENIAN worth:Wou'd the brave foe th' imperfect work engageWith honest freedom, not with partial rage,What just productions might the world surprize!What other POPES, what other MAROS rise!But since by foes, or friends alike deceiv'd,Too little those, and these too much believ'd;Since the same fate pursues by diff'rent ways,Undone by censure, or undone by praise;Since bards themselves submit to vice's rule,And party-feuds grow high, and patrons cool:Since, still unnam'd, unnumber'd ills behindRise black in air, and only wait the wind:Let me, O let me, ere the tempest roar,Catch the first gale, and make the nearest shore;In sacred silence join th' inglorious train,Where humble peace, and sweet contentment reign;If not thy precepts, thy example own,And steal thro' life not useless, tho' unknown.To the Honourable * * *By the Same.O CHARLES, in absence hear a friend complain,Who knows thou lov'st him whereso'er he goes,Yet feels uneasy starts of idle pain,And often would be told the thing he knows.Why then, thou loiterer, fleets the silent year,How dar'st thou give a friend unnecessary fear?We are not now beside that osier'd stream,Where erst we wander'd, thoughtless of the way:We do not now of distant ages dream,And cheat in converse half the ling'ring day;No fancied heroes rise at our command,And no TIMOLEON weeps, and bleeds no THEBAN band.Yet why complain? thou feel'st no want like these,From me, 'tis true, but me alone debar'd,Thou still in GRANTA'S shades enjoy'st at easeThe books we reverenc'd, and the friends we shar'd;Nor see'st without such aids the day decline,Nor think'st how much their loss has added weight to thine.Truth's genuine voice, the freely-opening mind,Are thine, are friendship's, and retirement's lot;To conversation is the world confin'd,Friends of an hour, who please and are forgot;And int'rest stains, and vanity controulsThe pure unsullied thoughts, and sallies of our souls.O I remember, and with pride repeatThe rapid progress which our friendship knew!Even at the first with willing minds we met,And ere the root was fix'd the branches grew,In vain had fortune plac'd her weak barrier,Clear was thy breast from pride, and mine from servile fear.I saw thee gen'rous, and with joy can say,My education rose above my birth,Thanks to those parent shades, on whose cold clayFall fast my tears, and lightly lie the earth!To them I owe whate'er I dare pretend,Thou saw'st with partial eyes, and bade me call thee friend.Let others meanly heap the treasur'd store,And aukward fondness cares on cares employTo leave a race more exquisitely poor,Possess'd of riches which they ne'er enjoy:He's only kind who takes the noble wayT'unbind the springs of thought and give them pow'r to play.His heirs shall bless him, and look down with scornOn vulgar pride from vaunted heroes sprung;Lords of themselves, thank heaven that they were bornAbove the sordid miser's glitt'ring dung,Above the servile grandeur of a throne,For they are Nature's heirs, and all her works their own.To Mr. GARRICK.By the Same.ON old PARNASSUS, t' other day,The Muses met to sing and play;Apart from all the rest were seenThe tragick and the comick queen,Engag'd, perhaps, in deep debate,On RICH'S, or on FLEETWOOD'S fate.When, on a sudden, news was broughtThat GARRICK had the patent got,And both their ladyships againMight now return to Drury-lane.They bow'd, they simper'd, and agreedThey wish'd the project might succeed,'Twas very possible, the caseWas likely too, and had a face—A face! Thalia titt'ring cry'd,And cou'd her joy no longer hide;Why, sister, all the world must seeHow much this makes for you and me;No longer now shall we exposeOur unbought goods to empty rows,Or meanly be oblig'd to courtFrom foreign aid a weak support;No more the poor polluted sceneShall teem with births of Harlequin;Or vindicated stage shall feelThe insults of the dancer's heel.Such idle trash we'll kindly spareTo operas now—they'll want them there;For Sadler's-Wells, they say, this yearHas quite undone their engineer.Pugh, you're a wag, the buskin'd prudeReply'd, and smil'd; besides 'tis rudeTo laugh at foreigners, you know,And triumph o'er a vanquish'd foe:For my part, I shall be contentIf things succeed as they are meant;And should not be displeas'd to findSome changes of the tragick kind.And say, THALIA, mayn't we hopeThe stage will take a larger scope?Shall he whose all-expressive powersCan reach the heights that SHAKESPEAR soars,Descend to touch an humbler key,And tickle ears with poetry;Where every tear is taught to flowThro' many a line's melodious woe,And heart-felt pangs of deep distressAre fritter'd into similes?—O thou, whom nature taught the artTo pierce, to cleave, to tear the heart,Whatever name delight thine ear,OTHELLO, RICHARD, HAMLET, LEAR,O undertake my just defence,And banish all but nature hence!See, to thy aid with streaming eyesThe fair afflicted Mrs. Cibber. CONSTANCE flies;Now wild as winds in madness tearsHer heaving breasts and scatter'd hairs;Or low on earth disdains reliefWith all the conscious pride of grief.My PRITCHARD too in HAMLET'S queen—The goddess of the sportive veinHere stop'd her short, and with a sneer,My PRITCHARD, if you please, my dear!Her tragick merit I confess,But surely mine's her proper dress;Behold her there with native ease,And native spirit, born to please;With all MARIA'S charms engage,Or MILWOOD'S arts, or TOUCHWOOD'S rage,Thro' every foible trace the fair,Or leave the town, and toilet's careTo chaunt in forests unconfin'dThe wilder notes of ROSALIND.O thou, where-e'er thou fix thy praise,BRUTE, DRUGGER, FRIBBLE, RANGER, BAYS!O join with her in my behalf,And teach an audience when to laugh.So shall buffoons with shame repairTo draw in fools at Smithfield fair,And real humour charm the age,Tho' Mr. Quin, inimitable in that character, who was then leaving the stage. FALSTAFF should forsake the stage.She spoke. MELPOMENE reply'd,And much was said on either side;And many a chief, and many a fair,Were mention'd to their credit there.But I'll not venture to displayWhat goddesses think fit to say.However, GARRICK, this at leastAppears, by both a truth confess'd,That their whole fate for many a yearBut hangs on your paternal care.A nation's taste depends on you—Perhaps a nation's virtue too.O think how glorious 'twere to raiseA theatre to virtue's praise.Where no indignant blush might rise,Nor wit be taught to plead for vice:But every young attentive earImbibe the precepts, living there.And every unexperienc'd breastThere feel its own rude hints express'd,And, waken'd by the glowing scene,Unfold the worth that lurks within.If possible, be perfect quite;A few short rules will guide you right.Consult your own good sense in all,Be deaf to fashion's fickle call,Nor e'er descend from reason's lawsTo court what you command, applause.NATURE to Dr. HOADLY. On his Comedy of the SUSPICIOUS HUSBAND.By the Same.SLY hypocrite! was this your aim?To borrow Paeon's sacred name,And lurk beneath his graver mien,To trace the secrets of my reign?Did I for this applaud your zeal,And point out each minuter wheel,Which finely taught the next to roll,And made my works one perfect whole?For who, but I, till you appear'dTo model the dramatic herd,E'er bade to wond'ring ears and eyes,Such pleasing intricacies rise?Where every part is nicely true,Yet touches still some master clue;Each riddle opening by degrees,'Till all unravels with such ease,That only those who will be blindCan feel one doubt perplex their mind.Nor was't enough, you thought, to write,But you must impiously uniteWith GARRICK too, who long beforeHad stole my whole expressive pow'r.That changeful Proteus of the stageUsurps my mirth, my grief, my rage;And as his diff'rent parts incline,Gives joys or pains, sincere as mine.Yet you shall find (howe'er elateYou triumph in your former cheat)'Tis not so easy to escapeIn Nature's as in Paeon's shape.For every critick, great or small,Hates every thing that's natural.The beaus, and ladies too, can say,What does he mean? is this a play?We see such people every day.Nay more, to chafe, and teize your spleen,And teach you how to steal again,My very fools shall prove you're bit,And damn you for your want of wit.The YOUTH and the PHILOSOPHER. A FABLE.By the Same.A Grecian Youth, of talents rare,Whom Plato's philosophick careHad form'd for virtue's nobler view,By precept and example too,Wou'd often boast his matchless skill,To curb the steed and guide the wheel.And as he pass'd the gazing throng,With graceful ease, and smack'd the thong,The ideot wonder they express'dWas praise and transport to his breast.At length quite vain, he needs would shewHis master what his art could do;And bade his slaves the chariot leadTo Academus' sacred shade.The trembling grove confess'd its fright,The wood-nymphs startled at the sight,The Muses drop the learned lyre,And to their inmost shades retire!Howe'er, the youth with forward air,Bows to the sage, and mounts the car,The lash resounds, the coursers spring,The chariot marks the rolling ring,And gath'ring crowds with eager eyes,And shouts, pursue him as he flies.Triumphant to the goal return'd,With nobler thirst his bosom burn'd;And now along th' indented plain,The self-same track he marks again,Pursues with care the nice design,Nor ever deviates from the line.Amazement seiz'd the circling crowd;The youths with emulation glow'd;Ev'n bearded sages hail'd the boy,And all, but Plato, gaz'd with joy.For he, deep-judging sage, beheldWith pain the triumphs of the field:And when the charioteer drew nigh,And, flush'd with hope, had caught his eye,Alas! unhappy youth, he cry'd,Expect no praise from me, (and sigh'd)With indignation I surveySuch skill and judgment thrown away.The time profusely squander'd there,On vulgar arts beneath thy care,If well employ'd, at less expence,Had taught thee honour, virtue, sense,And rais'd thee from a coachman's fateTo govern men, and guide the state.An ODE to a GENTLEMAN, On his pitching a Tent in his GARDEN.By the Same.AH! friend, forbear, nor fright the fieldsWith hostile scenes of imag'd war;Content still roves the blooming wilds,And sheds her mildest influence there:Ah! drive not the sweet wand'rer from her seat,Nor with rude arts profane her latest best retreat.Are there not bowers, and sylvan scenes,By nature's kind luxuriance wove?Has Romely lost the living greensWhich erst adorn'd her artless grove?Where thro' each hallow'd haunt the poet stray'd,And met the willing Muse, and peopled every shade.But now no bards thy woods among,Shall wait th' inspiring Muse's call;For tho' to mirth and festal songThy choice devotes the woven wall,Yet what avails that all be peace within,If horrors guard the gate, and scare us from the scene?'Tis true of old the patriarch spreadHis happier tents which knew not war,And chang'd at will the trampled meadFor fresher greens and purer air;But long has man forgot such simple ways,Truth unsuspecting harm!—the dream of ancient days.Ev'n he, cut off from human kind,(Thy neighb'ring wretch) the child of Care,Who to his native mines confin'd,Nor sees the sun, nor breathes the air,But 'midst the damps and darkness of earth's wombDrags out laborious life, and scarcely dreads the tomb;Ev'n he, should some indulgent chanceTransport him to thy sylvan reign,Would eye the floating veil askance,And hide him in his caves again,While dire presage in every breeze that blowsHears shrieks and clashing arms, and all Germania's woes.And doubt not thy polluted tasteA sudden vengeance shall pursue;Each fairy form we whilom trac'dAlong the morn or evening dew,Nymph, Satyr, Faun, shall vindicate their grove,Robb'd of its genuine charms, and hospitable Jove.I see, all-arm'd with dews unblest,Keen frosts, and noisome vapours drear,Already, from the bleak north-east,The Genius of the wood appear!—Far other office once his prime delight,To nurse thy saplings tall, and heal the harms of night,With ringlets quaint to curl thy shade,To bid the infect tribes retire,To guard thy walks and not invade—O wherefore then provoke his ire?Alas! with prayers, with tears his rage repel,While yet the red'ning shoots with embryo-blossoms swell.Too late thou'lt weep, when blights deformThe fairest produce of the year;Too late thou'lt weep, when every stormShall loudly thunder in thy ear,"Thus, thus the green-hair'd deities maintain"Their own eternal rights, and Nature's injur'd reign."On a MESSAGE-CARD in Verse. Sent by a LADY.By the Same.HERMES, the gamester of the sky,To share for once mankind's delights,Slip'd down to earth, exceeding sly,And bade his coachman drive to White's.In form a beau; so light he trips,You'd swear his wings were at his heels;From glass to glass alert he skips,And bows and prattles while he deals.In short, so well his part he play'd,The waiters took him for a peer;And ev'n some great ones whisp'ring saidHe was no vulgar foreigner.Whate'er he was, he swept the board,Won every bett, and every game;Stript even the Rooks, who stampt and roar'd,And wonder'd how the devil it came!He wonder'd too, and thought it hard;But found at last this great commandWas owing to one fav'rite card,Which still brought luck into his hand.The four of spades; whene'er he sawIts sable spots, he laugh'd at rules,Took odds beyond the gaming law,And Hoyle and Philidor were fools.But now, for now 'twas time to go,What gratitude shall he express?And what peculiar boon bestowUpon the cause of his success?Suppose, for something must be done,On Juno's self he cou'd prevailTo pick the pips out, one by one,And stick them in her peacock's tail,Shou'd Pallas have it, was a doubt,To twist her silk, or range her pins;Or should the Muses cut it out,For bridges to their violins.To Venus should the prize be giv'n,Superior beauty's just reward,And 'gainst the next great rout in heavenBe sent her for a message card.Or hold—by Jove, a lucky hit!Your goddesses are arrant farces;Go, carry it to Mrs. —And bid her fill it full of verses.The Je ne scai Quoi. A SONG.By the Same.I.YES, I'm in love, I feel it now,And CAELIA has undone me;And yet I'll swear I can't tell howThe pleasing plague stole on me.II.'Tis not her face which love creates,For there no graces revel;'Tis not her shape, for there the fatesHave rather been uncivil.III.'Tis not her air, for sure in thatThere's nothing more than common;And all her sense is only chat,Like any other woman.IV.Her voice, her touch might give th' alarm—'Twas both perhaps, or neither;In short, 'twas that provoking charmOf CAELIA altogether.An ODE On a distant Prospect of ETON COLLEGE.By Mr. GRAY.YE distant spires, ye antique towers,That crown the wat'ry glade,Where grateful science still adoresHer HENRY'S holy shade;And ye that from the stately browOf WINDSOR'S heights th' expanse belowOf grove, of lawn, of mead survey,Whose turf, whose shade, whose flowers amongWanders the hoary Thames alongHis silver-winding way.Ah happy hills, ah pleasing shade,Ah fields belov'd in vain,Where once my careless childhood stray'd,A stranger yet to pain!I feel the gales, that from ye blow,A momentary bliss bestow,As waving fresh their gladsome wing,My weary soul they seem to sooth,And, redolent of joy and youth,To breathe a second spring.Say, father THAMES, for thou hast seenFull many a sprightly raceDisporting on thy margent green,The paths of pleasure trace,Who foremost now delight to cleaveWith pliant arms thy glassy wave?The captive linnet which enthrall?What idle progeny succeedTo chase the rolling circle's speed,Or urge the flying ball?While some on earnest business bentTheir murm'ring labours ply,'Gainst graver hours, that bring constraintTo sweeten liberty:Some bold adventurers disdainThe limits of their little reign,And unknown regions dare descry:Still as they run, they look behind,They hear a voice in every wind,And snatch a fearful joy.Gay hope is theirs by fancy fed,Less pleasing when possess'd;The tear forgot as soon as shed,The sun-shine of the breast.Theirs buxom health of rosy hue,Wild wit, invention ever-new,And lively chear of vigour born;The thoughtless day, the easy night,The spirits pure, the slumbers light,That fly th' approach of morn.Alas, regardless of their doom,The little victims play!No sense have they of ills to come,No care beyond to-day:Yet see how all around 'em waitThe ministers of human fate,And black misfortune's baleful train!Ah, shew them where in ambush stand,To seize their prey the murth'rous band,Ah, shew them they are men!These shall the fury passions tear,The vultures of the mind,Disdainful anger, pallid fear,And shame that sculks behind;Or pineing love shall waste their youth,Or jealousy with rank'ling tooth,That inly gnaws the secret heart,And envy wan, and faded care,Grim-visag'd comfortless despair,And sorrow's piercing dart.Ambition this shall tempt to rise,Then whirl the wretch from high,To bitter scorn a sacrifice,And grinning infamy;The stings of falsehood those shall try,And hard unkindness' alter'd eye,That mocks the tear it forc'd to flow;And keen remorse with blood defil'd,And moody madness laughing wildAmidst severest woe.Lo, in the vale of years beneath,A griefly troop are seen,The painful family of death,More hideous than their queen:This racks the joints, this fires the veins,That every lab'ring sinew strains,Those in the deeper vitals rage:Lo, poverty, to fill the band,That numbs the soul with icy hand,And slow-consuming age.To each his suff'rings: all are men,Condemn'd alike to groan,The tender for another's pain;Th' unfeeling for his own.Yet ah! why should they know their fate!Since sorrow never comes too late,And happiness too swiftly flies.Thought would destroy their paradise.No more, where ignorance is bliss,'Tis folly to be wise.ODE.By the Same.I.LO! where the rosy-bosom'd hours,Fair VENUS' train appear,Disclose the long-expecting flowers,And wake the purple year!The ATTICK warbler pours her throatResponsive to the cuckow's note,The untaught harmony of spring:While whisp'ring pleasure as they fly,Cool Zephyrs thro' the clear blue skyTheir gather'd fragrance fling.II.Where-e'er the oak's thick branches stretchA broader browner shade;Where-e'er the rude and moss-green beechO'er-canopies the glade;Beside some water's rushy brinkWith me the Muse shall sit and think(At ease reclin'd in rustick state)How vain the ardour of the crowd,How low, how indigent the proud,How little are the great!III.Still is the toiling hand of care:The panting herds repose:Yet hark, how through the peopled airThe busy murmur glows!The insect youth are on the wing,Eager to taste the honied spring,And float amid the liquid noon:Some lightly o'er the current skim,Some shew their gayly-gilded trimQuick-glancing to the sun.IV.To Contemplation's sober eyeSuch is the race of man:And they that creep, and they that fly,Shall end where they began.Alike the busy and the gayBut flutter thro' life's little day,In fortune's varying colours dress'd:Brush'd by the hand of rough mischance,Or chill'd by age, their airy danceThey leave, in dust to rest.V.Methinks I hear in accents lowThe sportive kind reply:Poor moralist! and what art thou?A solitary fly!Thy joys no glittering female meets,No hive hast thou of hoarded sweets,No painted plumage to display:On hasty wings thy youth is flown;Thy sun is set, thy spring is gone—We frolick, while 'tis May.ODE on the Death of a Favourite CAT, Drowned in a Tub of Gold Fishes.By the Same.I.'TWAS on a lofty vase's side,Where China's gayest art had dy'dThe azure flowers, that blow;Demurest of the Tabby kind,The pensive Selima reclin'd,Gaz'd on the lake below.II.Her conscious tail her joy declar'd;The fair round face, the snowy beard,The velvet of her paws,The coat that with the tortoise vies,Her ears of jet, and emerald eyes,She saw; and purr'd applause.III.Still had she gaz'd: but 'midst the tideTwo beauteous forms were seen to glide,The Genii of the stream;Their scaly armour's Tyrian hueThro' richest purple to the viewBetray'd a golden gleam.IV.The hapless nymph with wonder saw:A whisker first and then a clawWith many an ardent wish,She stretch'd in vain to reach the prize.What female heart can gold despise?What cat's averse to fish?V.Presumptuous maid!

drop thy cypress on yon mournful bier!Begin: nor more delayThe sacred meed of gratitude to pay:Begin: whate'er immortal song can do,To the dear name of CAROLINE is due:Who loves the Muse, deserves the Muse's love:Then raise thy numbers high,Sound out her glory to the throne of Jove,Spread the glad voice thro' all the ambient sky,From the dull marble vindicate her praise,And waft it down to lighten future days.II.Ye bards to come, the song of truth attend:This, this is she, the Muse's judge and friend!The royal female! whose benignant handThroughout fair ALBION'S landDealt every useful, every decent part,Each MEMPHIAN science, and each ATTICK art:Within the Muse's bowerShe oft was wont to lose the vacant hour,Or underneath the sapient grot reclin'd,Her soul to contemplation she resign'd,And for awhile laid downThe painful, envied burthen of a crown:Mean time thy rural ditty was not mute,Sweet bard of MERLIN'S cave!Tho' rude, thy ditty was of her, who gaveThy voice to sing, and tun'd thy oaten fluteIn strains unwonted to the ear of swain:As when the lark, ambitious of the skies,Quits the low harvest of the golden plain,Taught by the sun's inspiring warmth to rise,Sublime in air he spreads his dappled wings,Mounts the blue aether, and in mounting sings.III.But whither wanders the licentious song?Such joyous notes to happier days belong!Ah me! our happier days are now no more: —Return, sad Muse: see pale BRITANNIA weep,See all the sisters of the subject deepTheir sovereign's loss deplore!See fond IERNE gives her sorrows vent,And as she tunes her brazen lyre to woe,Indulge her grief to flow! —See even the northern ORCADES lament!Nor ends the wailing here:Where-e'er beneath our flag wild Ocean roars,From farthest ORIENT to HESPERIA'S shores,From torrid AFFRICK to the world's cold end,The BRITISH woes extend:And every colony has dropt a tear.IV.O honour'd flood! with reeds Pierian crown'd,ISIS! whose argent waters glide alongFair BELLOSITE'S Lycaean shades renown'd,Now aid my feeble song;And call thy chosen sons, and bid them bringTheir lays of DORICK air,With lenient sounds to steal awhile from careTh' inconsolable King:O! sooth his anguish, and compose his painsWith artful unimaginable strains,According sweetly to the golden lyre,Such as might half inspireThe iron breast of HADES to resignOur lost, lov'd CAROLINE.V.These are thy glorious deeds, almighty Death!These are thy triumphs o'er the sons of men,That now receive the miserable breath,Which the next moment they resign again!Ah me! what boots us all our boasted power,Our golden treasure, and our purpled state?They cannot ward th' inevitable hour,Nor stay the fearful violence of Fate:—Virtue herself shall fail:Else now, if virtue ever could prevail,Death had not dar'd to violate the throne,Nor had BRITANNIA heard her sovereign groan.—Ye nymphs! recall the song:For heaven-born virtue does to heaven belong,And scorns the meanest of her sons should die,But opens him a passage to the sky;Her rod ay-pointing to th' eternal goal,From the brute earth she frees the ardent soul;Swift from the vulgar herd aloft she springs,Spurns the moist clay, and soars on azure wings,VI.Then hence with sorrows vain:Ye Theban Muses! elevate the strain:Search o'er the records of immortal fame,And high refulgent on the female line,Imblaze in starry characters the nameOf BRITISH CAROLINE:While sacred story rings with SHEBA'S praise,While BERENICE'S virtues still inspireThe CYRENEAN lyre,And GLORIANA blooms in SPENSER'S lays;Thy name, great Queen, shall glow in every page,Shall dwell in every clime, and live in every age.When GEORGE shall go, where WILLIAM went before,And all the present world shall be no more;When the fond factions of unjust mankind,The mean, the mad, the envious, and the blind,Shall turn to worms and dust;Then Time, impartial judge, that states the priceOf each man's virtue, and of each man's vice,From thy bright fame shall clear the cank'ring rust;And O! the Muses ever shall be just.VII.But lo! what sudden radiance gilds the skies?'Tis Gratitude descending from above,Known by the sweetness of her dove-like eyes,Daughter of truth and universal love!To HENRY'S sacred dome she wafts along,And on thy tomb she poursCelestial sweets and aramanthine flowers:The old, the young, the rich, the wretched crowdNumerous around her, and with accents loudRaise the mix'd voice, and pour the grateful song:"Hail Queen adorn'd by nature and by art!"Thine was each virtue of the head and heart;"Thy people blest thee, and thy children lov'd,"And thy King honour'd, and thy God approv'd,"VIII.But here my labours cease:'Tis time the foaming courser to release.And thou, O royal shade,Forgive the Muse that these vain honours paid;A Muse as yet unheeded and unknown;That dares to sacrifice to truth alone,Not prone to blame, not hasty to commend,No foe unjust, no mercenary friend,No sensual bosom, no ungenerous mind,And tho' not virtuous, virtuously inclin'd.A PIPE of TOBACCO In Imitation of Six Several AUTHORS.IMITATION I.

C. Y.By the Same.CHARLES, son of Yorke, who on the mercy-seatOf justice states the bounds of right and wrong;Not like the vulgar law-bewilder'd throng,Who in the maze of error, hope to meetTruth, or hope rather to delude with liesAnd airy phantoms, under truth's disguise.Some wrapt in precedents, or points decreed,Or lop or stretch the laws to forms precise:Some, who the pedantry of rules despise,Plain sense adopt, from legal fetters freed;Sense without science, fleeting, unconfin'd,Is empty guess, and shifts with ev'ry wind.But he, thy sire, with more discerning toil,Rang'd the wide field, sagacious to exploreWhere lay dispers'd or hid the precious ore;Then form'd into a whole the gather'd spoil,Law, reason, equity, which now unite,Reflecting each on each a friendly light.Blest in a guide, a pattern so compleat,Tread, as thou do'st his footsteps; for not rudeThy genius, not uncultur'd, unsubdu'd.Yet there are intervals and seasons meet,To smooth the brow of thought; nor thou disdainFit hour of vacance with the Muse's train.Let meaner spirits, cast in common mould,Who feed on husks of learned lore, refuseTo hear the lessons of the warbling Muse;Nor know that bards, the law-givers of old,By soothing song to moral truth beguil'dMan, till then fierce, a lawless race, and wild.What means the lyre, by which the fabled sageDrew beasts to listen, and made rocks advanceAround him as he play'd, in mystick dance?What, but the Muse? who soften'd human rage.Parent of concord, she prepar'd the planOf social life, and man attun'd to man.She taught the sphere to move in fair array,Each in their orbits heark'ning to her strain;Else would they wander o'er th' etherial plainLicentious, but that she directs their way:She aw'd to temper, by her magick spell,The warring elements, and powers of hell.They err, who think the MUSES not ally'dTo THEMIS; both are of celestial birth:Both give peace, order, harmony to earth;Both by one heav'nly fountain are supply'd;And men and angels hymn, in general quire,What law ordains, and what the NINE inspire.From CAELIA to CLOE.By the Same.I Rural life enjoy, the town's your taste,In this we differ, twins in all the rest.Yet when the dog-star brings diseases on,And each fond mother trembles for her son;Now when the Mall's forlorn, the beaux and bellesAll for retirement crowd to Tunbridge-Wells;Say, will not CLOE for awhile withdrawFrom dear Vaux-hall and charming Ranelagh?Sure at this homely hutt one may contriveAwhile not only to exist, but live;For not dull landscapes here my thoughts engross,Woods, lawns, and rills, and grottoes green with moss.No, the same appetite that courts infuse,Haunts in retreat, and to the shade pursues.Here all my care are to receive and payVisits, my studies a romance or play.And then to pass the live-long Sunday off,Walks or a ride, nay church serves well enough.At church, one has a chance to see cockades,Lur'd thither in pursuit of country-maids:Or tall Hibernian smit with fond desireTo wed the only daughter of a squire.Cards have their turn, to kill a tedious hour,If baulk'd of whist, piquette is in my pow'r;For oft the captain, fresh from town, bestowsA friendly week upon his friend my spouse.Then gaily glide the days on downy feet,For sure the captain has prodigious wit;O I could hear his sweet discourse for ever,Of all that's done, and who and who's together,Oft far and wide for new delights I range,True sex, and constant to the love of change.Is there within ten miles a troop review'd,An auction of old goods, an interludeBy strolling players, an horse-race, or a ball!There to be seen I have an urgent call.The labours of the plough are then forgot,And THOMAS mounts the box in liv'ry coat.Scenes odd as these, if CLOE can endure,(And yet these scenes are town in miniature)Come, and reflect on Ranelagh with scorn,Content ev'n here, at least till routs return.ON A FIT of the GOUT.By the Same.WHerefore was man thus form'd with eye sublime,With active joints, to traverse hill or plain,But to contemplate nature in her prime,Lord of this ample world, his fair domain?Why on this various earth such beauty pour'd,But for thy pleasure, man, her sovereign lord?Why does the mantling vine her juice affordNectareous, but to cheer with cordial taste?Why are the earth and air and ocean stor'dWith beast, fish, fowl; if not for man's repast!Yet what avails to me, or taste, or sight,Exil'd from every object of delight?So much I feel of anguish, day and nightTortur'd, benumb'd; in vain the fields to rangeMe vernal breezes, and mild suns invite:In vain the banquet smokes with kindly changeOf delicacies, while on every platePain lurks in ambush, and alluring fate.Fool not to know the friendly powers createThese maladies in pity to mankind;These abdicated reason reinstate,When lawless appetite usurps the mind;Heaven's faithful centries at the door of blissPlac'd to deter, or to chastise excess.Weak is the aid of wisdom to repressPassion perverse; philosophy how vain!'Gainst Circe's cup, enchanting sorceress;Or when the Syren sings her warbling strain.Whate'er or sages teach, or bards reveal,Men still are men, and learn but when they feel.As in some free and well-pois'd common-wealSedition warns the rulers how to steer,As storms and thunders rattling with loud peal,From noxious dregs the dull horizon clear;So when the mind imbrutes in sloth supine,Sharp pangs awake her energy divine.Cease, then, ah cease, fond mortal, to repineAt laws, which nature wisely did ordain;Pleasure, what is it? rightly to define,'Tis but a short liv'd interval from pain:Or rather each alternately renew'd,Give to our lives a sweet vicissitude.HORACE, Ode 14. Book I. imitated in 1746.By the Same.O Ship! shall new waves again bear thee to sea?Where, alas! art thou driving? keep steady to shore.Thy sides are left without an oar,And thy shaken mast groans, to rude tempests a prey.Thy tackle all torn, can no longer endureThe assaults of the surge that now triumphs and reigns,None of thy sails entire remains,Nor a GOD to protect in another sad hour.Tho' thy outside bespeaks thee of noble descent,The forest's chief pride, yet thy race and thy name,What are they but an empty name?Wise mariners trust not to gilding and paint.Beware then lest Thou float, uncertain again,The sport of wild winds; late my sorrowful care,And now my fondest wish, bewareOf the changeable shoals where the Rhine meets the Main.The Female Right to LITERATURE, in a Letter to a young Lady from FLORENCE.By —WHilst you, ATHENIA, with assiduous toilReap the rich fruits of learning's fertile soil;Now search whate'er historick truth has shewn,And make the wealth of ages past your own;Now crop the blossoms of poetick flow'rs,And range delighted in the Muses bowers;Say, will the sweetest of her sex attendTo lines by friendship, not by by flatt'ry penn'd;To lines which tempt not worth with empty praise;But to still greater height that worth would raise;To lines which dare against a world decide,And stem the rage of custom's rapid tide!Come then, ATHENIA, freely let us scanThe coward insults of that tyrant, man.Self-prais'd, and grasping at despotick pow'r,He looks on slav'ry as the female dow'r;To Nature's boon ascribes what force has giv'n,And usurpation deems the gift of heav'n.See the first-peopled East, where ASIA shedsHer balmy spices o'er her fertile meads:There, while th' ASSYRIAN stretch'd his wide domainFrom distant Indus to the Cyprian main,All nature's laws by impious force were broke;The female sex to slav'ry's galling yokeBow'd their fair necks: from social life confin'd,And all th' exertions of th' enlighten'd mind,Clos'd in a proud Seraglio's wanton bow'rs,The dalliance of a tyrant's looser hours.By kings' examples subjects form their lives,Dependent satraps had their train of wives;Proportion'd pow'r each petty tyrant craves,And each poor female was the slave of slaves.When PERSIA next o'erturn'd th' Assyrian throne,Destroy'd her tyranny and fix'd its own;The fair distress'd no milder treatment saw,This was indeed th' unalterable law.In future times, whatever masters came,Tyrants were chang'd, but tyranny the same:At length t' accumulate the female woes,The grand impostor MAHOMET arose;Swoln with prophetick lyes, he lay'd his planOn the firm basis of the pride of man;"Women, the toys of men, and slaves of lust,"Are but mere moulds to form man's outward crust;"The heavenly spark, that animates the clay,"Of the prime essence that effulgent ray,"Th' immortal soul is all to man confin'd,"Not meanly squander'd on weak woman-kind."Accursed wretch! by hell's black council driv'nThus to debase the fairest work of heav'n.And could Religion rear her sacred headFraught with such doctrines? could such errors spreadFrom western TANGIER, and the sun-burnt Moor,To the cold TARTAR'S ever-frozen shore?Ev'n GREECE too not exempt, GREECE, once the seatWhere Sense and Freedom held the reins of state;Where Force was Reason's hand-maid; where the bandsOf Love and Friendship join'd the wedded hands;Where flourish'd once, and flourish still in fameTh' ATHENIAN matron, and the SPARTAN dame.In ROME too Liberty once reign'd, in ROMEThe female virtues were allow'd to bloom,And bloom they did: when CANNAE'S fatal plainWas heap'd with mountains of the Roman slain,Was there a matron wept her children dead?Was there a matron wept not those that fled?Then when each rumour seem'd the voice of fate,And spoke the victor thund'ring at their gate,Was there one mention'd peace? did they not pourTheir wealth, their jewels to the publick store,In emulous haste all pressing to be poor?Alas how chang'd! how are the mighty sunk,From the firm Patriot to the whining Monk!Where Industry secur'd the publick good,Where censors, consuls, and dictators plough'd.Now lazy zealots batten on the spoil,And consecrated Sloth devours the farmer's toil.But oh still worse! where Love and Friendship shone,Domestick Tyranny has fix'd his throne,With all his train of monsters: at his sideSwoln with self-flatteries sits stiff-neck'd Pride;Two twin-born fiends his other ear engage,Heart-canker'd Jealousy, and fire-ey'd Rage;In front, his empire's sole support and source,Rattling chains, bars and locks, stalks brutal Force;Whilst pale and shrivel'd, crouch'd beneath the chair,Lies sneaking, conscious Worthlessness; and nearSquint-ey'd Suspicion lurks, with self-distracting Fear.Hail, happy BRITAIN, dear parental land,Where Liberty maintains her latest stand!Oh while amidst tyrannick realms I rove,Enamour'd let me pour my filial loveInto thy bosom. When the raven wingsOf darkness hover o'er me, when the springsOf every outward sense are shut, my soulThee oft revisits, oft without controulRanges thy fields delighted, and inhalesFriendship's pure joys, and Freedom's healthful gales.But say, BRITANNIA, do thy sons, who claimA birth-right liberty, dispense the sameIn equal scales? Why then does Custom bindIn chains of Ignorance the female mind?Why is to them the bright etherial rayOf science veil'd? Why does each pedant say,"Shield me, propitious powers, nor clog my life"With that supreme of plagues a learned wife."'Tis man's, with science to expand the soul,"And wing his eagle-flight from pole to pole;"'Tis his to pierce antiquity's dark gloom,"And the still thicker shades of times to come;"'Tis his to guide the pond'rous helm of state,"And bear alone all wisdom's solid weight."Let woman with alluring graces move"The fondling passions and the baby love;"Be this our only science, be her doom"Fix'd to the toilette, the spinnet and loom."Tongue-doughty pedant, was ATHENIA'S soulForm'd for these only? Bring th' exactest ruleOf judgment to the tryal, prove that e'erThy school-proud tribe engross'd a greater shareOf mental excellence; tho' vernal YouthJusts swell her lovely bosom, yet blest Truth,Offspring of Sense and Industry, has thereLong fix'd her residence; and taught the fairOr wisdom's deep recesses to explore,Or on invention's rapid wings to soarAbove th' Aonian mount; and can'st thou thinkThat virtues, which exalt the soul, can sinkThe outward charms? must knowledge give offence?And are the graces all at war with sense?Say, who of all the fair is form'd to moveThe fondest passions, most ecstatick love,More than ATHENIA? in her gentle eyeSoft innocence and virgin modestyIncessant shine, while still a new-born graceSprings in each speaking feature of her face.Her sprightly wit no forward pertness spoils:No self-assuming air her judgment soils;Still prone to learn, tho' capable to teach,And lofty all her thoughts, but humble all her speech.Proceed, ATHENIA, let thy growing mindTake ev'ry knowledge in of ev'ry kind:Still on perfection fix thy steady eye,Be ever rising, rise thou ne'er so high.But oh reflect, that in th' advent'rous flight,Thou mount'st a glorious, but a dangerous height:When ev'ry science ev'ry grace shall join,When most thy wit, when most thy beauties shine,When thickest crowds enamour'd press around,When loudest ev'ry tongue thy praise shall sound,When verse too offers incense to thy shrine,And adoration breathes in ev'ry line,Then let my friendly Muse express her care,Then most will danger spread her viewless snare:Then let this truth possess thy inmost soul,"One drop of Vanity may spoil the whole."Not self-secure on earth can Knowledge dwell,Knowledge the bliss of heav'n and pang of hell,Alike the instrument of good and evil,The attribute of God and of the Devil.Without her, Virtue is a powerless Will;She, without Virtue, is a powerful ill;Does she then join with Virtue, or oppose,She proves the best of Friends, or worst of Foes.O! be they once in happiest union join'd,And be that union in ATHENIA'S mind.On SHAKESPEAR'S Monument at Stratford upon Avon.By the Same.GREAT HOMER'S birth sev'n rival cities claim,Too mighty such monopoly of Fame;Yet not to birth alone did HOMER oweHis wond'rous worth; what EGYPT could bestow,With all the schools of GREECE and ASIA join'd,Enlarg'd th' immense expansion of his mind.Nor yet unrival'd the MAEONIAN strain,The Milton.

But happier STRATFORD, thouWith incontested laurels deck thy brow:Thy Bard was thine unschool'd, and from thee broughtMore than all EGYPT, GREECE, or ASIA taught.Not HOMER'S self such matchless honours won;The Greek has Rivals, but thy SHAKESPEAR none.A SONG.By the Same.I.WHEN fair SERENA fair I knew,By friendship's happy union charm'd;Incessant joys around her slew,And gentle smiles my bosom warm'd.II.But when with fond officious careI press'd to breathe my amorous pain,Her lips spoke nought but cold despair,Her eyes shot ice through ev'ry vein.III.Thus in ITALIA'S lovely valesThe sun his genial vigour yields,Reviving heat each sense regales,And plenty crowns the smiling fields.IV.When nearer we approach this ray,High on the Alps' stupendous brow,Surpriz'd we see pale sun-beams playOn everlasting hills of snow.CHISWICK.By the Same.THE potent Lord, that this bright villa plann'd,Exhibits here a Paradise regain'd;Whate'er of Verdure have Hills, Lawns, or Woods,Whate'er of Splendor, Buildings, Flow'rs, or Floods,Whate'er of Fruits the Trees, of Birds the Air,In blissful union are collected here:All with such harmony dispos'd, as shews,That in the midst the Tree of Knowledge grows.The INDIFFERENT.From the Italian of Metastasio.THANKS, CLOE, thy coquetting artAt length hath heal'd my love-sick heart,At length thy slave is free;I feel no tyrant's proud controul,I feel no inmate in my soul,But peace and liberty.No longer now a fierce desireIn anger masks its amorous fire,And fiercer burns suppress'd,I blush not when thy name I hear,I meet thee suddenly, and fearNo fluttering in my breast.In dreams I ev'ry trifle see,Yet very rarely dream of thee:I wake, nor think about thee:When absent I ne'er wish thee near:And when thou'rt present I not fear,Nor pray to be without thee.I think, hear, talk about thy charms,Nor stoop the head, nor fold the arms;Nay ev'n my wrongs sit easy.And when my favour'd rival's nearAnd eyes me with insulting leer,His triumphs never teaze me.Put on thy looks of cold disdain,Or speak respectful, 'tis in vain,Nor frowns nor smiles can move.Those lips no more have words that bind,Those eyes no more have light to findThe path that leads to love.Seasons, which wont to take their dyeOf foul or fair, from CLOE'S eye,Now their own livery wear.This place I hate, and that I love,The fen's a fen, the grove's a grove,If absent thou, or there.Judge if I speak like one sincere,Still I confess your face is fair,But so are twenty faces;And if plain truth will not offend,You've now some features I could mend,Which once appear'd all graces.Nay more, I own, when from my heartI strove to tug the fatal dartI cut my heart in sunder:But to relieve a constant pain,And to retrieve one's self again,What would one not go-under?The fluttering bird in viscous snareEntangled, willingly will spareFor liberty a feather;In time again the feather grows,And wise by danger made, he knowsTo shun the snare for ever.But still I hear you smiling say,'Tis sign you've flung their chains away,You take such pains to shew 'em.Why, CLOE, there's a fond delightOur former dangers to recite,And let our neighbours know 'em.After the thunder of the wars,The veteran thus displays his scars,And tells you of his pains;The galley-slave, enslav'd no more,Shews you the shackles which he wore,And where their mark remains.I talk, 'cause talking gives delight,I please myself not GLOE by't,Nor care if she believe;And when myself she deigns to name,Whether she praise my song or blame,I neither joy nor grieve.For me I quit a fickle fair,CLOE has lost a heart sincere,Who first should sing Te deum?You'll never find so true a swain;But women full as false as vain,By dozens one may see 'em.The TRIUMPH of INDIFFERENCE.Being the same ODE, imitated by an unknown Hand.I.THANKS, dear coquet! indulgent cheat!Kind heaven, and your more kind deceit,At length have set me free;No more I sigh, and doat, and pine,All ease without, and calm within,In peace and liberty.II.Cupid no more has power to scorch,Time sure has robb'd him of his torch,Ne'er was a cooler creature:That name no more has such eclat,No more my heart goes pit-a-patAt sight of each dear feature.III.I sleep at night, and sometimes dream,Nor you the fond vexatious theme;I wake, nor think about you:I meet, I leave you, meet again,But feel no mighty joy or pain,Or with you, or without you.IV.Now with indifference I chatOf eyes, lips, bubbies, and all that,And laugh at former follies:Joke with my rival when we meet,What eye so keen! what lips so sweet!What skin so soft as Molly's!V.Leave then those little torturing arts,You practise on complying hearts;They're all in vain, believe me:Whether those eyes look kind or weep,The pouting, or the smiling lip,Will neither please, nor grieve me.VI.From those despotick looks, no more(Once tyrants of each sickle hour)I date my grief and joy:May, tho' you frown, looks sweetly clad;And dull December's mighty sad,Tho' you stand smiling by.VII.Yet still (for I am quite sincere)You're mighty pretty,—true, my dear,But, like your pretty sex,You've here and there, and now and thenA failing; for like other men,I now can spy defects.VIII.Yet once with coward fondness curs'd,My poor weak heart I fear'd would burstAt thought of separation:But now despise my feeble chain,And bless the salutary painThat cur'd me of my passion.IX.Impatient of his iron cage,The bird thus spends his little rage,And 'scapes with shatter'd wings:But soon with new-sledg'd pinions soars,And hast'ning to his native bow'rs,A joyful welcome sings.X.Fond female vanity will say,These long harangues they sure betrayA heart that's hankering still:This passion so proclaim'd in song,This tale so pleasing to the tongue,Does it not touch the will?XI.Lovers like soldiers, Molly, dwellWith pleasure on the horrid tale,When all the danger's o'er:Like other slaves from setters free,We smile with anxious joy, to seeThe chains which once we wore.XII.In kind indulgence to a heart,Engag'd in so severe a part,This sweet revenge I write:Rail, weep, be woman all, for ILull'd in indifference, defyYour fondness or your spite.XIII.A frail false maid I lost, but youA man, fond, gen'rous, and true;Which fortune is the worse?Try all love's mighty empire round,A faithful lover's seldom found;A jilt's a common curse.The SHEPHERD'S FAREWEL to his LOVE. Being the same ODE.Translated by Mr. RODERICK.PHoebe, thank thy false heart, it has fix'd my repose,The gods have had pity at length on my woes;I feel it, I feel my soul loose from its chain,And at last freedom comes, often dream'd of in vain.The flame is burn'd out, and each passion at rest.Under which love disguis'd still might lurk in my breast;No more, when thou'rt nam'd, the warm blushes arise,No more slutters my heart, when I meet with your eyes.In my sleep now no longer thy image I see,Nor the first of my thoughts, when I wake, is of thee▪When from thee, no more of thy absence I plain,When with thee, I feel neither pleasure nor pain.My heart without fondness can muse on thy charms,My past pains I recount, yet no passion alarms;Discompos'd I'm no longer, when tow'rd me you move,And at ease with my rival I talk of my love.Whether haughty thy frown, whether gentle thy strain,In vain thy proud looks, thy fond speeches in vain;Thy false tongue to beguile me no more has the art,No more thy keen eye knows the way to my heart.Whether pensive or cheerful, no longer to youFor this are my thanks, or for that my blame due:The gay prospect now pleases, though you are away,And your presence no more can make dreariness gay.Believe me, I still can allow that thou'rt fair,But not that no fair-one can with thee compare;And though beauteous I own thee, yet still in thy faceI can now spy a fault, which I once thought a grace.When first the fix'd arrow I pluck'd from my heart,Oh, methought I shou'd die! so severe was the smart:But from pow'r so oppressive to set myself clear,Torments greater than dying with patience I'd bear.When lim'd the poor bird thus with eagerness strains,Nor regrets the lost plume, so his freedom he gains;The loss of his plumage small time will restore,And once try'd the false twig, it can cheat him no more.The old flame, never flatter yourself to believe,While it dwells on my tongue, in my heart still must live;Our dangers, when past, with delight we repeat,What in suffering was pain, to remembrance is sweet.'Tis thus when the soldier returns from the wars,He fights o'er his old battles, and vaunts of his scars:With pleasure the captive his liberty gain'dThe fetters thus shows, which once held him enchain'd.Thus I talk, and I still will talk on while I may,Nor heed I, though you disbelieve what I say:I ask not that Phoebe my talk should approve,Let her too, if she can, talk at ease of my love.An inconstant I leave, a true lover you lose;Which first of us two will have comfort, who knows?This I know—Phoebe ne'er such a true love will find;I can easily meet with a fair as unkind.RIDDLE.By the Same.THrough the close covert of the shady grove,One summer's day it was my chance to rove,Where, shrouded from the sun's too scorching ray,Stretch'd at her ease, half-slumbering Cloe lay.Occasion so inviting, who could miss?Softly I stole, and snatch'd a sudden kiss.Startled at first, the rising blush display'dThe quick resentment of the ruffled maid;Lively display'd—for soon it over past;Such blushing anger never long did last!Quick reconcilement must to rage succeed,Where wrongs ideal solid pleasures breed.Submissive looks my pardon soon obtain'd,And pardon'd love as soon new boldness gain'd.Offending thus, forgiving thus, we lay,Long time entranc'd with the alternate play;'Till warn'd, too soon, by envious night, we part:The thrilling joy still flutters round my heart;Thought still, tho' fainter, paints the glowing bliss,On fancy's lip still cleaves the rapt'rous kiss.But mark the sad effects of casual love,And tread with caution in the shady grove.In due time, Cloe at my doors appears,A fix'd composure on her brow she wears;And guess the cause: close in her lap conceal'dA lovely twin in either hand she held;And take, she cry'd, these pledges of our love,These fruits you planted in the shady grove.Soft as the downy bloom on Cloe's check,Smooth as the polish'd ivory of her neck,Warm as her bosom, white as was her arm,So smooth were they and white, so soft and warm,Pleas'd I receiv'd them for the giver's sake,Heedless what censures strait-lac'd prudes might make.Compliant to my forming hand they grew,And with their size increas'd obedience due,As I direct they take th' appointed bent,With ev'ry motion, ev'ry beck, consent,Whate'er I want, they reach with ready hand,Where-e'er I go, they wait at my command.Now at ease one in my bosom lays;While by my side the other wanton plays;Now this my hand embraces; t' other free,Takes his full swing and plays at liberty.Before me hand in hand sometimes they move,Emblems of friendship, and united love;Sometimes behind my leading steps they traceStill closely knit in brotherly embrace;Anon on either side as guards attend,At once adorn me, and at once defend.Still more and more my love they thus engage,Thus still shall cherish my declining age;And when th' appointed hour of fate shall come,They'll follow still attendant on my tomb.More lasting far than man's soon fading breath,Their love extends beyond the vale of death;They'll hang for ever o'er my much-lov'd bust,Till they themselves, like me, are turn'd to dust.RIDDLE.—Mortalis in unumQuodque caput, vultu mutabilis, albus an ater.By the Same.TORN from the fruitful spot on which I grew,Me innocent unnumber'd pains pursue;Pains more afflicting, as from man they flow,From parent man! for birth to man I owe.Sometimes on spikes of steel my nerves they rend,Sometimes asunder split from end to end;In boiling cauldrons now immers'd I lie,Now doom'd the rage of drying fires to try:There while in double torment scorch'd and drown'd,Fast tied I writhe the rigid stake around.Last their fierce hate its utmost effort triesWith all Barbarian pomp of sacrifice.The purple fillet round my temples wreathes,From every part the scented unguent breathes;O'er my white locks the sacred flower is spreadWhilst on the fatal block is plac'd my head.Yet with fix'd constancy I bear my doom;And constancy at last will overcome.From all my tryals I return at length,My worth increas'd, my beauty, and my strength.The suffering martyr thus in torment dies,In sainted state more glorious to arise.And now I re-assume my native state,My torturers now beneath their burden sweat,Slaves in their turn to me, and think it prideIf on their subject necks I deign to ride.Yet still my filial duty I retain,Unchang'd by honours, as unmov'd by pain.Still to mankind a friend, I daily shedMy warmest blessings on his parent head;Around him still with fond embraces twine,As round the elm her tendrils curls the vine.Nor quit him e'er till he to rest repairs,And every morn renew my constant cares.Ready alike on rich and poor to wait;I suit myself to every different state.With priest in whitish dress array'd I shine,Emblem of purity and truth divine.His solemn face the doctor owes to me,His solemn face, to which he owes his fee.At bench, or bar, I add a dignityTo th' upright sentence, or rhetorick plea;Hence without me no judge explains the laws,Nor coifed council pleads the puzzling cause:In fullest floods my bounty showers on themProfuse, descending to the garment's hem.Gorgeous in silken garb I grace the beau;And all around ambrosial fragrance throw;Nor less decorous, tho' with dust o'erspread,When to the camp the valiant warriors lead,Gorgonian terrors to each mien I add,And still their weakest part with care I shade.RIDDLE.By the Same.MY size is large, my shape's uncouth,I have neither limb nor feature;Mens hands have form'd my skin so smooth:My guts were made by nature.Nor male nor female is my sex,You'll scarce believe my troth;For when I've told you all my tricksYou'll swear 't must needs be both.For oft my master lies with me,His wife I oft enjoy;Yet's she's no whore, no cuckold he,And true to both am I.My cloaths nor women fit, nor men,They're neither coat nor gown;Yet oft both men and maidens, whenThey're naked, have them on.When I'm upon my legs, I lie,Yet legs in truth I've none;And never am I seen so highTo rise as when I'm down.What's oft my belly, is oft my back,And what my feet, my head;And though I'm up, I have a knackOf being still a-bed.Audivere, Lyce, &c.

E.SONNET I.O*, whom virtue makes the worthy heirOf **'s titles, and of*'s estate,Blest in a wife, whose beauty, though so rare,Is the least grace of all that round her wait,While other youths, sprung from the good and great,In devious paths of pleasure seek their bane,Reckless of wisdom's lore, of birth, or state,Meanly debauch'd, or insolently vain;Through Virtue's sacred gate to Honour's faneYou and your fair associate ceaseless climbWith glorious emulation, sure to gainA meed, shall last beyond the reign of Time:From your example long may Britain see,Degenerate Britain, what the great should be.SONNET II.WIsely, O C*; enjoy the present hour,The present hour is all the time we have,High God the rest has plac'd beyond our pow'r,Consign'd, perhaps, to grief—or to the grave.Wretched the man, who toils ambition's slave;Who pines for wealth, or sighs for empty fame;Who rolls in pleasures which the mind deprave,Bought with severe remorse, and guilty shame.Virtue and knowledge be our better aim;These help us Ill to bear, or teach to shun;Let friendship cheer us with her gen'rous flame,Friendship, the sum of all our joys in one;So shall we live each moment fate has giv'n;How long, or short, let us resign to heav'n.SONNET III.To F. K. EsqO Sprung from worthies, who with counsels wiseAdorn'd and strengthen'd great Elisa's throne,Who yet with virtuous pride, may'st well despiseTo borrow praise from merits not thy own.Oft as I view the monumental stoneWhere our lov'd H***'s cold ashes rest,Musing on joys with him long past and gone,A pleasing sad remembrance fills my breast.—Did the sharp pang we feel for friends deceas'dUnbated last, we must with anguish die;But nature bids its rigour should be eas'dBy lenient time, and strong necessity:These calm the passions, and subdue the mindTo bear th' appointed lot of human kind.SONNET IV.C**s, I hop'd the little heaven shall spareOf my short day, which flits away so fast,And sickness threats with clouds to overcast,In social converse oft with thee to share.Ill-luck for me, that wayward fate should tearThee from the haven thou had'st gain'd at last,Again to try the toils and dangers pastIn foreign climates, and an hostile air:Yet duteous to thy country's call attend,Which claims a portion of thy useful years,And back with speed thy course to Britain bend.If, e'er again we meet, perchance should endMy dark'ning eve, thou'lt pay some friendly tears,Grateful to him, who liv'd and dy'd thy friend.SONNET V. On a FAMILY-PICTURE.WHEN pensive on that portraiture I gaze,Where my four brothers round about me stand,And four fair sisters smile with graces bland,The goodly monument of happier days;And think, how soon insatiate death, who preysOn all, has cropp'd the rest with ruthless hand,While only I survive of all that band,Which one chaste bed did to my father raise;It seems, that like a column left alone,The tott'ring remnant of some splendid fane,'Scap'd from the fury of the barb'rous Gaul,And wasting Time, which has the rest o'erthrown,Amidst our house's ruins I remain,Single, unprop'd, and nodding to my fall.SONNET VI.R**, who well hast judg'd the task too hard,Of this short life throughout the total dayTo follow glory's false bewitching ray,Through certain toils, uncertain of reward;A prince's service how should we regard;As service still—though deck'd in livery gay,Disguis'd with titles, gilded o'er with pay,Specious, yet ill to liberty preferr'd.Bounding thy wishes by the golden mean,Nor weakly bartering happiness for show,Wisely thou'st left the busy bustling scene,Where merit seldom has successful been,In C**'s shades to taste the joys, that flowFrom calm retirement, and a mind serene.SONNET VII.C**e, with whom, my pilot and my guide,Pleas'd I have travers'd thy Sabrina's flood,Both where she foams impetuous soil'd with mud,And where she peaceful rolls her golden tide.Never, O never let ambition's pride(Too oft pretexted with our country's good)And tinsel'd pomp, despis'd when understood,Or thirst of wealth thee from her banks divide.Reflect how calmly, like her infant wave,Flows the clear current of a private life;See the wide publick stream by tempests toss'd,Of ev'ry changing wind the sport, or slave,Soil'd with corruption, vex'd with party strife,Cover'd with wrecks of peace and honour lost.SONNET VIII.

To the Author of Observations on the Conversion and Apostleship of St. PAUL.O***, great meed shalt thou receive,Great meed of fame, thou and thy learn'd compeer,Who 'gainst the sceptic's doubt, and scorner's sneer,Assert those heav'n-born truths, which you believe.In elder time thus heroes wont t' atchieveRenown, they held the faith of JESUS dear,And round their ivy-crown, or laurell'd spear,Blush'd not religion's olive branch to weave.Thus Raleigh, thus immortal Sidney shone(Illustrious names) in great Elisa's days.Nor doubt his promise firm, that such who ownIn evil times, undaunted, though alone,His glorious truth, such he will crown with praise,And glad agnize before his Father's throne.SONNET XI.YOung, fair, and good! ah why should young and fairAnd good be huddled in untimely grave?Must so sweet flow'r so brief a period have,Just bloom and charm, then fade and disappear?Yet our's the loss, who ill alas can spareThe bright example, which thy virtues gave;The guerdon thine, whom gracious heav'n did saveFrom longer trial in this vale of care.Rest then, sweet saint, in peace and honour rest,While our true tears bedew thy maiden hearse,Light lie the earth upon thy lovely breast;And let a grateful heart with grief oppress'dTo thy dear mem'ry consecrate this verse,Though all too mean for who deserves the best.SONNET XII.W*, whose dear friendship in the dawning yearsOf undesigning Childhood first began,Through Youth's gay morn with even tenor ran,My noon conducted, and my evening cheers,Rightly dost thou, in whom combin'd appearsWhate'er for Public Life completes the Man,With active Zeal strike out a larger plan,No useless friend to Senators and Peers:Me moderate talents and a small estateFit for Retirement's unambitious shade,Nor envy I who near approach the throne;But joyful see thee mingle with the Great,See thy deserts with due distinction paid,And praise thy lot, contented with my own.SONNET XIII.
