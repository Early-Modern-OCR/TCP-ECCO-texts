THE RIVAL SISTERS.A TRAGEDY.—Scelerate, revertere, Theseu;Flecte ratem; numerum non habet illa suum.OVID.ADAPTED FOR THEATRICAL REPRESENTATION, AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL, DRURY-LANE.REGULATED FROM THE PROMPT-BOOK, By Permission of the Manager.The Lines distinguished by inverted Commas, are omitted in the Representation, and those printed in Italics are Additions.LONDON: PRINTED BY JOHN BELL, British Library, STRAND, Bookseller to His ROYAL HIGHNESS the PRINCE of WALES.MDCC XCIII.PREFACETHERE is, perhaps, nothing more uninteresting than the generality of those preliminary discourses, in which Authors too frequently lay out much of their time in talking of themselves and their works. The importance of a Man to himself is fully displayed, while the Reader yawns over the tedious page, or laughs at the rhetoric, that would persuade him he ought to be pleased. The present Writer has been unwilling, upon almost all occasions, to conform to a practice which he saw attended with so little success: But the following Tragedy is sent into the worla in a manner that may require some explanation. It has not gone through the siery trial of the Theatre; nor is it recommended by the favourable decision of an Audience. The pomp of splendid scenery, and the illusions of the skilful performer, have not awakened the public attention:—The Play ventures abroad, without having previously gained, by the advantages of representation, a character, which in the leisure of the closet is not always supported. But this circumstance, while it raises no expectation, may, on the other hand, excite a prejudice not casy to be sarmounted. If it be of any value, why was it not produced in the usual form of a Public Exhibition? The reasons that influenced the Author, would lead to a long and frivolous detail. Whatever those reasons were, whether caprice, whim, peevishness, or delicacy, they were of weight to determine his conduct. His work, however, does not go forth with accusations of any kind against the Proprietors of either Theatre: it makes no appeal from their judgment. The fact is, it never was in their hands; and where there was no refusal, there can be no room for complaint.It need not be dissambled, that the Play was written with a view to the Stage. It was begun and finished in the Summer 1783, at a time when the Author was disabled, by a nervous disorder in

his eyes, from pursuing a more important work, which has engaged several years of his life. It was painful to read, and he found amusement necessary. He walked in green fields, made verses, and threw them upon paper in characters almost illegible. For a subject, he was not long at a less. He remembered that Madame de SévignéVide her Letter 1st April, 1672. mentions her having attended the representation of ARIANE, a Tragedy by the younger Corneille. The play, says that amiable Writer, though in its general style and conduct flat and insipid; was, notwithstanding, followed by all Paris, not for the sake of the poetry, but the Actress, La Champmélé, whom she calls the greatest prodigy the Stage ever beheld. The others were disgusting; but when the Champmélé entered the scene, a murmur of applause ran through the Theatre; every heart was interested, and every eye dissolved in tears.WHEN this country could, with pride, boast of an Actress equally followed, and perhaps with better reason; it occurred that a Tragedy, with the beauties of the original, but freed from it's defects, might, at such a season, be acceptable to the Public. The defects, which drew down the judgment of so enlightened a Critic as Madame de Sévigné, are pointed out with minute exactress, by the judicious Voltaire.See his Edition of Corseille's Works. From that pleasing Writer we learn, that the Tragedy in question still keeps it's rank upon the Stage, whenever an Actress of eminence wishes for an opportunity to display her talents in a principal character. The situation he observes, is interesting and pathetic: "A princess, who has done every thing for her hero; who has delivered him from a cruel death, and sacrificed all considerations for his sake; who loves him generously; who thinks herself loved in return, and deserves to be so; who finds herself, at last, abandoned by the Man whom she adores, and betrayed by a Sister whom she also loved: 'A woman thus situated,' says I Voltaire, 'forms the happiest subject that has come down to as from antiquity.' Notwithstanding this general account, Voltaire's observations, which trace the Author scene by scene, show that Madame de Sévigné was not mistaken in her judgment.SHALL the present Writer flatter himself that he has removed the vices of the first concoction, and substituted what is better? He has certainly endeavoured to do it. For this purpose a New Fable was necessary. The progress of the business required to be conducted in a different manner, with more rapidity, and without those languid scenes which weaken the interest, and too often border upon the dialogue of Comedy. The characters were to be cast in a new mould; and instead of definitions of the passions, their conflict, their vehemence, and their various transitions, were to be painted forth in higher colouring, than are to be found in the French composition. The Reader, therefore, is not to expect a mere translation. The Author does not scruple to say that he entered into a competition with the original; that he has aimed at a better Tragedy; and to use the words of a late elegant Writer, he hopes he has shown some invention, though he has built upon another man's ground.BUT here again the question recurs, if the new superstructure raised upon the old foundation has any merit, why not produce it with all the advantage of that celebrated Actress, who, it seems inspired the first design? The plain truth shall be the answer: When the piece was finished, the Author had his moments of self-approbation, and in his first ardour, hinted to a friend, that he intended to give it to the Stage. But self-approbation did not last long:—That glow of imagination, which (to speak the truth) is sometimes heated into a pleasing delirium with its own work, subsided by degrees, and doubt and diffidence succeeded. A Play, that might linger nine nights upon the Stage, was not the object of the Author's ambition; Whether he has been able to execute any thing better, he has not considered for a long time, nor has he now courage to determine. He has often said to himself, in the words of TULLY, Nihil hue, nisi perfectum ingenio, Elaboratum Industriâ, afferri oportere; and after adopting, in his own case, so rigid a rule, how shall he presume to say, that the production of a summer can boast either of genius, or the elaborate touches of industry?IN this irresolute state of mind, the Author's respect for the Public, who have done him, upon former occasions, very particular

honour, increased his t'midity: he was unwilling to appear a candidate for their favour, when he was not sure of adding to their pleasure. At present, being to give an edition of such pieces, as he has been able to produce, he could not think of keeping back the only dramatic work left upon his hands. He, therefore, sends it into the world an humble adventurer: with one of, his predecessors, he says, 'Va mon Enfant; prens ta Fortune.' The Play amused him while he was engaged in the writing of it, and should the candid Reader find an hour of leisure not entirely thrown away in the perusal, the Author will not think his time altogether mis-employed. He now dismisses the Piece, if not with indifference, at least with resignation; content to leave the honours of the Theatre to Writers of more ambition than he possesses at present.Non jam prima peto Mnestheus, neque vincere certo:Quamquam O! sed saperent, quibus hoc, Neptune, dedisti.VIRG.— Veianius armis,Herculisis ad postem fixis, latet abditus agro;Ne poputum extrem'd toties exoret arenà.HOR.LINCOLN'S-INN, March 4, 1786.Dramatis Personae.DRURY-LANE.Men.PERIANDER, King of Naxes, — Mr. Wroughton.THESEUS, — Mr. Palmer.PERITHOUS, — Mr. Kemble.ARCHON, an Officer of Periander, Mr. Packer.ALETES, Ambassador from Minos, King of Crete, — Mr. Caulfield.OFFICER, — Mr. Phillimore.Women.ARIADNE, — Mrs. Siddons.PHAEDRA, — Mrs. PowellVIRGINS attending on Ariadne, &c.SCENE, the Palace of Periander, in the Isle of Naxos.THE RIVAL SISTERS.ACT I.SCENE I.PERIANDER'S Palace.

In a night like this,Why quit your couch, and to the whirlwind's rage,The vollied lightening, and the war of nature,Why wilt thou thus commit thy tender frame?—Thunder and lightning.Again that dreadful peal!—"All-gracious Powers!"What crime provokes your wrath? must this fair island,"That long hath flourish'd in th' Aegean deep,"Must Naxos with her sons, a blameless race,"Burn to the centre, and the brawling waves"Close o'er the wreck for ever?Another clap of thunder."Phae.Oh, that burst"Shoots horror to my soul!"Arc.Thus through the night"Hath the wild uproar shook the groaning isle."Fierce rain and liquid fire in mingled torrents"Came rushing o'er the land. The wrath of Heaven"Rides in the tempest. Towers and sacred domes"Fell in promiscuous ruin. Ships were dash'd,"On pointed rocks, or swallowed in the deep."Destruction rages round:" amidst the roar,When all things else, when ev'n the fiercest naturesShrink from the hideous ruin, you aloneWalk through the storm, with fierce, with hagard mien,A form that suits the dreadful wild commotion.Phae.Yes, with a heart, in which the storm that rages,Surpasses all the horrors of the night."Yes, here I come supreme in misery."I only wake to cares unknown to him"Who treads secure the paths of humble life,"And thanks the gods for his obscure retreat,"For the blest shade in which their bounty plac'd him."Phae.'Tis you have rais'd this tempest of the soul.You, sir, are minister; you govern here,And bend at will an unsuspecting monarch.To thee he yields his oracie of state;And when with wrongs you have oppress'd mankind,'Tis the king's pleasure; 'tis the royal will.Arc.Unjust, ungenerous charge! have you forgot,When first your vessel reach'd the coast of Naxos?You sued for leave to land upon the isle:To pray for shelter here. Ere that we heardTheseus was with you: Theseus, whom the stateOf Athens sent a sacrifice to Minos,A victim to absolve the annual tribute,Impos'd by conquest: Ariadne's love,Her generous efforts to redeem the hero,Ev'n then were known at Periander's court.The wond'rous story on the wings of FameHad reach'd our Isle; she pity'd, and she lov'd him.Phae.She lov'd him—Yes, she saw, and she ador'd.Gods! who could see the graces of his youth,His cause, his innocence, the hero's mien,Manly and firm, yet soften'd by distress,Gods! who could see him, and not gaze entranc'dIn ecstacy and love?—What have I said?My warmth too far transports me—ah! bewareAside.'Twas as you say; she pity'd, and she lov'd.Arc.She favour'd his escape: you fled together.To ev'ry neighb'ring isle you wing'd your flight.You visited each realm; with prayers and tearsWearied each court. All fear'd your father's power.You came to Naxos; Periander's will,Your orator, came forth. Did not I then—Phae.You succour'd our distress:the tear of sympathyStood in your eye; and you may boast your merit—You play'd it well, sir.Arc.This ambiguous strainBut ill requites the offices of friendship;For you I watch'd the temper of the king,His ebbs and flows of passion: in apt seasonYou landed here. Thrice hath the waning moonConceal'd her light, and thrice renew'd her orb,While you, meantime, have liv'd protected here.Each hour has seen your sister AriadneRise in her charms; and now with boundless swayShe reigns supreme in Periander's heart.Phae.True, we have found protection from your king.Three months have pass'd—but in that time a statesman.May change his mind. New views of interest—New plans of policy, fair seeming motives,May give new principles.Arc.It is my first.My best ambition to relieve the wretched.You wrong me, princess; you had best retire.Phae.No; Periander first shall hear my suit.Here will I wait his coming; on the earthFall prostrate at his fect, implore his mercy.Cling round his knees; and never loose my hold.Till his heart melt, and save us from destruction.Enter THESEUS.The.What plaintive sorrow thro' the lonely palaceAlarms my lift'ning ear?Phae.That well-known voiceDispels my fears. O! Theseus, how my heartBounds at thy lov'd approach! and yet this dayDecides your doom.—Archon can tell you all.This day resigns you to my father's power.Here Periander has resolv'd to answerTh' ambassador of Crete.The.Controul thy fears.Archon has serv'd me, and I thank him for it.All will be well; the king protects us still.Archon, the storm that threaten'd hideous ruinAt length subsides. The angry blast recallsIts train of horrors. Through the sev'ring cloudsFaint gleams of day disclose the face of things.The raging deep, that rose in mountain billows,Sinks to repose: The winds, the waves are hush'd.From yon high tower, that overhangs the bay,I view'd the ocean round. No sail appears,No vessel cleaves the deep, save one escap'dFrom the wild uproar of the warring winds;That with it's shatter'd masts, and lab'ring oars,Stems the rough tide, and enters now the harbour.Phae.Another sail! and enters now the harbour!From whence? Who and what are they? From what coast?Alas, from Crete! 'tis Minos sends; my father's wrathPursues us still; another embassyComes to demand us all,And banish ev'ry fear.Arc.Perhaps some vesselRich with the stores, with busy commerce sendsFrom the adjacent isles, on Naxos' coastNow seeks a shelter from the roaring deep—I'll to the harbour. Theseus, be it thineTo pour o'er Phaedra's wees the balm of comfort,And hush her cares to peace. From Crete, I trust,The messengers of woe no more will come,To urge their stern demand.Exit.Phae.Go, traitor, go;Pernicious vile dissembler!The.Ah! forbear.Phae.He seems a friend, the surer to betray.Full well he knows that Ariadne's charms.Have wak'd a flame in Periander's heart.To that alliance with a statesman's craftHe stands a foe conceal'd: He dre ds to seeOn Naxos' throne a queen from Minos sprung,And therefore plans our ruin."The.Yet thy fancy,"Still arm'd against itself, turns'pale and trembles"At shadowy forms. Were thy suspicions just,"Wherefore reveal them? Why unguard thyself,"And lay each secret open to your foe?"With him, whose rankling malice works unseen,"While smiles becalm his looks, 'twere best pretend"Not to perceive the lurking treachery—"Reproof but goads him, and new whets his passions;"Till what was policy becomes revenge—"Detected villany can ne'er forgive."Phae.And must I fall in silence? must we perish,"Abandon'd by ourselves, tame, willing victims;"Nor let the murd'rer hear one dying groan?"Must I behold him with his treach'rous arts,"A lurking foe, nor pour my curses on him;"But poorly crouch, and thank him for the blow?"Oh! love like mine, the love which you inspired,"That each day rises still to higher ardour;"Think'st thou that love like mine will calmly see thee"Giv'n up a victim to my father's rage?"The.And think'st thou then that Archon is my foe?Phae.He is; I know him well; he means destruction.Th' ambassador of Crete will soon have audience.Archon concerted all. Oh! if my careCould counteract his dark, his sell designs,Then were I bless'd indeed. When first you landedA helpless victim on the Cretan shoe;Full well you know, soft pity touch'd my heart,And soon, that tender pity chang'd to love.I wish'd to save you: Ariadne's fortuneGave her the clue that led you thro' the maze.Her zeal out-ran my speed, but not my love.And would my fate allow me now to save thee,Then by that tie ('tis all my sister's claim)I then should prove me worthy of thy love.The.Deem me not, gen'rous Phaedra, deem me notForm'd of such common clay, so dead to beauty,As not to feel with transport at my heartThy powerful charms. To AriadneI owe my life. That boon demands respect,Demands my gratitude: But love must springSpontaneous in the heart, it's only source,Unmix'd with other motives than it's own;Unbrib'd, unbought—above all vulgar ties.PhaeAnd yet while ruin—The.Check this storm of passion,Nor think, with abject fear that PerianderWill e'er resign us. Ariadne's charmsHave touch'd his heart. "His words, his looks proclaim it,"In the soft tumult all his soul is lost,"He dwells for ever on the lov'd idea,"And with her beauty means to grace his throne."Phae.Archon abhors the union: To prevent it,"His deep designs—"Hear what I shall disclose,And treasure it in sacred silence seal'd.Last night admitted to a private audience,Wrapt in the friendly mantle of the dark—Enter an OFFICER.The.What would'st thou? speak thy purpose.Of.At the harbourThat fronts the northern wave, a ship from AthensThis moment is arriv'd.Phae.Relief from Athens!Of.Your presence there by all is loudly call'd for.The.Say to my friends, I will attend them straight.Exit Officer.Phae,A ray of hope to gild the cloud of woe.The.Now PhaeDRA, mark me. Let thy fears subside.Last night when ev'ry care was lull'd to res't,No eye to trace my steps, no conscious earTo catch the sound, then Periander grantedA private conference: I unbosom'd to him,In confidence, the secrets; of my heart.To Ariadne I resign'd all claim;Renounc'd each tender passion. PerianderNo longer view'd me with a rival's eye.He promis'd his protection. AriadneHas pow'rful charms, and the king bears a heartTo beauty not impassive. Joy and raptureSpoke in his eye, and purpled o'er his face.With vanity she'll hear a monarch's sighs,Proud of her sway. A diadem will quenchHer former flame, with glitt'ring splendor tempt her,And make the infidelity her own.Phae.But if she hears a sister dares disputeA heart like thine—The.Trust to my prudent caution.That dang'rous secret I have skreen'd with care.Here it lies buried. Periander thinksA former flame, kindled long since in Greece,Preys on my heart with slow consuming fires.But hark—beware —this way some hasty step.Enter ARCHON.Arc.The Greeks now issue on the beck. They bringTidings from Athens, and from every tongueYour name resounds, and rings along the shore.The.Thy friendship knows no pause; each hour your bringNew succour to the wretched. Princess, farewell.Archon, I thank thee, and now seek my friends.Exit.Arc.Princess, if once again I may presumeTo offer friendly counsel; from this place'Twere best you now retire. Yon' eastern cloudsBlush with the orient day. My royal master,Attentive ever to the cares of state,Will soon be here.Phae.Let him first hear my pray'r;Permit me here to see him. To the voiceOf misery his ear will not be clos'dA flourish of Trumpets.Enter PERIANDER, and attendant Officers.Oh! Periander' 'midst the nations fam'dFor wisdom and for justice, let thy heartIncline to mercy. Spare, oh, spare the wretched.Perian.Rise, Princess, rise. That humble suppliant stateSuits not the dignity of Minos' daughter.Whence this alarm, and why those gushing tears?Phae.We fled for refuge to you. Oh! protect,Protect the innocent. You gave us shelter;It was a godlike act; recal it not;Yield us not victims to a father's wrath;Nor by one barbarous action sully allThe glories of your reign. Save Ariadne,Save Theseus too: our misery claims respect.Perian.Save Ariadne! can that beauteous mournerSuspect my promis'd faith? perhaps ev'n now,Like some frail flow'r by beating rains oppress'd,She pining droops, and fickens in despair.Oh! quickly seek her: with the words of comfortHeal all her woes; raise that afflicted fair,And bid the graces of her matchless formFlourish secure beneath my fost'ring smile.When Ariadne sues, a monarch's heartYields to her tears with transport.Phae.Men will praiseThe gen'rous deed: the gods will bless thee for it.Exit.Arc.The Ambassador from Crete with Minos' ordersAttends your royal will.Perian.He shall be heard.He ascends his Throne.Enter ALETES.Perian.To Naxos' court, Aletes, your are welcome.You come commssion'd from the Cretan, king:Now speak your embassy.Al.In fairest termsOf friendly greeting Minos, sir, by meImparts his rightful claim. He knows the justice,The moderation that directs your counsels:He knows, though oft' in the embattled fieldYour sword has reek'd with blood, your wisdom stillRespects the rights of kings; respects the laws,That hold the nations in the bonds of peace.To you, sir, he appeals; he claims his daughters,His rebel daughters, leagu'd against his crown:He claims the victim from his vengeance rescued;Rescued by fraud, by Ariadne's fraud;And here at Naxos shelter'd from his justice.A sov'reign and a parent claims his rights.You will respect the father and the king.Perian.Of Minos' virtues, his renown in arms,His plan of laws, that spread around the blessingsOf sacred order, and of social life;Laws, which even kings obey, the world has heardWith praise, with gratitude. All must revereThe legislator, and the friend of man:But in the sorrows that distract his house,Is it for me with rash mistaken zealTo interpose my care? is it for meTo judge his daughter's conduct? What decree,What law of mine, what policy of NaxosHave they offended? All who roam the deepFind in my ports a safe, a sure retreat.Should I comply with your proud, bold request,The hardy genius of this sea-girt isleWould call it tyranny, and power usurp'd;'Tis law, and not the sov'reign's will, that hereControuls, directs, and animates the stateAl.The law that favours wrongs, and shelters guilt,Subverts all order. Through her hundred citiesAll Crete will mourn your answer. With regretMinos will hear it. By pacific meansHe would prevail; by justice, not the sword.But, Sir, if justice, if a righteous causeAt your tribunal list their voice in vain,I see the gath'ring storm; I see the dangersThat hover round your isle, and o'er the sceneHumanity lets fall the natural tear;The sons of Crete, a brave, a gen'rous race,Active and ardent in their monarch's causeAlready grasp the sword. "I see the ocean"White with unnumber'd sails; your coast, your harbours"Beleaguer'd close. I see the martial bands"Planting their banners on the well-fought shore;"Your hills, your plains glitt'ring with hostile arms,"Your cities sack'd, your villages on fire,"While from its source each river swoln with carnage"Runs crimson to the main. I see the conqueror"Urge to your capital with rapid march,"And desolation cov'ring all the land."Still, Sir, you may prevent this waste of blood;"Your timely wisdom—"Perian.The scope appearsOf your fair seeming message. And does Minos,Fam'd as he is in arms, say, does he hopeWith proud imperious sway to lord it o'er.The Princes of the world? And does he mean.To write his laws in blood? And must the nationsCrouch at his nod? Must I upon my throneLook pale and tremble, when your fancied JoveGrasps the unlifted thunder? Tell your kingHe knows my warlike name—knows we have metIn fields of death, oppos'd in adverse ranks,Braving each other's lance—he knows the sinew,With which this arm can wield the deathful blade.Or send the missive javelin on the foe,Thirsting for blood.—Go, bear my answer back,And say besides, that Naxos boasts a raceRough as their clime, by liberty inspir'd,Of stubborn nerve, and unsubmitting spirit,Who laugh to scorn a foreign master's claim.You've spoke your embassy, and have our answer.Al.Unwilling I bear hence th' ungrateful tidings.Exit.Perian.To-morrow's sun shall see him spread his sails:He must not linger here.Arc.Your pardon, Sir,This answer may provoke the powers of Crete,And war, inevitable war ensues.Perian.Let the invader come, here we have warTo meet his bravest troops.Arc.But where the numbersTo man each port, and line the sea-beat shore?Within the realm should the foe flush'd with conquestRear his proud banner—Perian.With auxiliar aidGreece will espouse my cause. The fleets of AthensFull soon shall cover the Aegean deep,And with confederated bands repelA tyrant's claim.Arc.Each state will urge its claim.Minos demands his daughter: Greece expectsHer gallant warrior, and ev'n now assertsTo crown his love, the princess, as her own.Let Theseus spread his sails, and steer for Greece,With Ariadne, partner of his flight.You gain that gen'rous state: by ev'ry tieOf honour bound, Athens unsheaths her sword.And haughty Minos threatens here in vain.Perian.Yield Ariadne! yield that matchless beauty,Where all the loves, where all the graces dwell!No, I will save her; will protect her hereFrom rude unhallow'd violence. Do thouHaste to the palace, where the princess dwells;Say to th' attendant train, ourself will come,To tell the counsels which my heart has form'd.Arc.Ay, there it lies,—there lurks the secret woundLove strikes the sweet infection to his soul.Tis as I fear'd. [Aside.]— Perhaps by mild remonstranceWe may gain time, and by the specious arts,Of treaty and debate prevent the war.Perian.You know my orders; see them straight obeyed.Exit Arc.Perian.Yes, Ariadne, from the inclement stormsOf thy rude fortune, it is fix'd to shield thee,And soften all thy woes. Her father then,When with her milder ray returning reasonBecalms his breast, shall thank the friend that heldHis rage suspended, and with joy shall hearThat Ariadne reigns the queen of Naxos;Here rules with gentle sway a willing people,And with her virtues dignifies a throne.Exit.ACT II.SCENE I.Enter PERIANDER, with Attendants.Periander.LET all with duty, with observance meet,Wait on the princess: let the virgin trainWith songs of rapture, and melodious airsTry their best art; wake all the magic pow'rOf harmony, to soothe that tender breast,And with soft numbers lull each sense of pain,I have beheld her, gaz'd on ev'ry charm,And Ariadne triumphs in my heart.Enter ARCHON.Arc.A messenger from Athens waits your pleasure.Perian.From Athens, say'st thou?Arc.In the northern bayHis ship is moor'd. Theseus attends the stranger;And both now crave an audience.Perian.In apt time.Their messenger arrives: when war impends,Tidings from Athens are right welcome to me:They breathe new vigour. Let the Greek approach.Enter THESEUS and PERITHOUS.The.Forgive the transports of a heart that swellsAbove all bounds, when I behold my friend,My gallant, gen'rous friend, the brave Perithous!It glads my soul, thus to present before youA chief renown'd in arms, the best of men,My other self, the partner of my toils,And my best guide to glory.Perian.To the virtuesOf the brave chief my ear is not a stranger,You come from Athens?Perit.Scarce two days have pass'dSince thence I parted. Through the realms of Greeceame spread at large th' adventures of my friend,With Ariadne's glory, and the deed,The gen'rous deed, that snatch'd him from destruction;How she conveyed him to this happy shore,How he has been receiv'd and shelter'd here.The men of Athens, sensibly aliveTo each fine motive, each exalted purpose,Have heard with gratitude. My feeble voiceWould but degrade the sentiments that burnIn ev'ry breast, with joy and rapture fir'dWarm with the best sensations of the heart,They pour their thanks, the tribute of their praise.Perian.The praise that's offer'd by the sons of Greece,By that herioc, that enlighten'd race,Is the best meed fair virtue can receive.Perit.That fair reward is yours: your worth demands it.To my brave friend Athens next points her care."What crime is his? Did he imbrue his hands"In young Androgeus' blood? Why should he fall"To expiate the death of Minos' son?"Against the innocent who makes reprisals,"And on the blameless head lets fall the sword,"Offers up victims to his fell revenge."'Tis murder, and not justice."Perian.Righteous Heaven"In th' hour of danger has watch'd o'er your friend,"And he has triumph'd o'er their barb'rous rites,"Their savage law, the stain of Minos' reign."Perit.Exulting now she pants for his return.In crowds her eager citizens go forth,And on the beach, and on the wave-worn cliff,O'er all the main rowl their desiring eyes,And ask of ev'ry ship that ploughs the deep,News of their hero. A whole people's voiceChose me their delegate, their faithful officer,To seek my friend, and bear him hence with speedBack to his native land.Perian.The laws of NaxosTo all are equal. None are here constrain'dNone forced by violence, or lawless pow'r,To quit this safe, this hospitable shore.Theseus will use the rights of free-born men.'Tis his to give the answer.The.For this goodnessMy heart o'erflows with more than words can speak.Perit.All Greece will thank you.—Ariadne too—Perian.How?—Ariadne, say'st thou?Perit.With delight,With admiration, with unbounded transport,Athens has heard her gen'rous exploits;Has heard, when Theseus on the Cretan shoreArriv'd to glut their vengeance, how the tearBedew'd her cheek. She pitied his misfortunes,And whom she snatch'd from death, she means to blessWith that rare beauty, and connubial love.Perian.Ha! do'st thou come to sink me to a slave?'Tis pride, 'tis arrogance makes this demand.Must I obey the proud imperious mandate?Bear Ariadne with you!—By yon' Heaven,No pow'r on earth shall force her from the isle.—"If thou presum'st again—"Perit.I never have,"I never can presume—"Perian.'Tis insolence!—"Is this the praise? Are these the thanks you bring?"Urge that request no more.—"Perit.If to my wordsYou'll deign to lend a favourable ear—"Perian.Say, on what law does Athens found a right"To claim, an alien princess?"Perit.When her choice,"Her gen'rous choice, the impulse of the heart,"Inclines her will, you will not fetter freedom?"Perian.Her father claims her:—dost thou vainly hope,That Greece can silence his paternal rights?Is that your errand?—Who commission'd thee?—Is Theseus your adviser? and does heSecond this proud attempt?The.No, Theseus neverWill plan, or counsel what may stain your honour.Perit.Nor will he e'er forget,—I know him well—I know his gratitude, his gen'rous warmth,His constancy and truth—He'll ne'er forgetHis vows of faithful love. The debt he owesTo Ariadne never can be paid.Athens approves their union; tuneful bardsPrepare the tribute of immortal verse,And white-rob'd virgins ev'n now are ready,Where e'er she treads, to scatter at her feetThe blooming spring, and at the sacred altarTo hymn the bridal song.The.Unthinking man!This blind mistaken zeal will ruin all.Aside.Perian.No more! I'll hear no more!—here break we off.Proud Greek, forbear, nor wound again my earWith terms of vile disgrace. Another wordOf yielding Ariadne, and by HeavenThe claims of Minos—His ambassadorIs here at hand; once more I'll give him audience.And if again this outrage to my crown,—If Theseus is found tamp'ring in your plot,—If you presume, by subtlety and fraud,To Theseus,To mock my hopes, and after last night's conference,Renounce your honour, my resentment rous'dMay do a deed to whelm you all in ruin;Then, let your friend, when next he dares approach us,Learn to respect a monarch, who disdainsA proud demand from the vain states of Greece.Exit.Perit.The states of Greece, proud monarch! be assur'd,Will vindicate their rights.—Ha!—why that lookOf wild dismay? that countenance of sorrow?Explain;—what means my friend?The.Alas! you know not,You little know the horror and despairIn which the hand of fate has plung'd my soul."Perit.And can despair oppress thee? can thy heart"Know that pale inmate? By our dangers past,"By all our wars, spite of this braggart king,"The beauteous Ariadne shall be thine."The.No more; no more of that:—I cannot speak—"Perit.Those falt'ring accents, and those lab'ring sighsImport some strange alarm."The.Oh! lead me hence,"To meet the fiercest monsters of the desart,"Rather than bear this conflict of the mind!"Perit.Unfold this mystery."— Those downcast eyes—The.You have awaken'd Periander's fury.Thy words have led me to a precipice,And I stand trembling on the giddy brink.Perit.From thence I'll lead thee to the peaceful vale,To life and happiness.—And can you thus,When all your country's wishes bless your name,When Athens to promote your happiness—The.They may mis-judge my happiness:—Alas!I thank them:—little do they know of Theseus.Perit.They know your virtues, your heroic ardour,Your patriot toil in the great cause of Greece:They know that honour in your breast has fix'dHer sacred shrine: They know the gen'rous flameThat love has wak'd in Ariadne's breast,And how, in gratitude, the bright ideaMust fire a soul like thine.—The.Too deep, too deep"Each accent pierces here.Aside."Perit.Those faithful arms"Shall soon receive her."The.You should not have claim'd her.Perit.Not claim that excellence! that rarest beauty—"The.By that mistaken claim you've rais'd a storm"That soon may burst in ruin on my head."You've fir'd to madness Periander's soul,"And wounded me, here in the tend'rest nerve,"That twines about the heart. For Ariadne"Thy suit is vain, 'tis fruitless: urge no more.Let me embark for Greece; gain my dismission;But for the princess, name her not: her libertyThe heart of Periander ne'er will grant:No words that e'er were form'd will wring it from him.Perit.Not grant her freedom! not release her hence!Should he refuse, all Greece will rise in arms:One common cause will form the gen'rous league.Soon Periander shall behold the oceanWhite with the foam of twenty thousand ships;The Grecian phalanx posted on his hills,And his desenceless island wrapt in flames.The.Let Greece forget me, nor in such a causeUnchain the fury of wide-wasting war.Oh! not for me such slaughter.Perit.Think'st thou GreeceWill see thee torn from Ariadne's arms?From her who sacrific'd her all for thee?From her whose courage has brav'd ev'ry danger;Fied from her country, from her father's court,To save her hero's life? From her, whose beautyAlready is the praise of wond'ring Greece,Surpassing all that lavish fancy forms.I know the princess; the revolving yearHas not yet clos'd it's round, since I beheld herThe pride, the glory of the Cretan dames."That harmony of shape, that winning grace;"And when she moves, that dignity of mien!"Those eyes, whose quick and inexpressive glance"Brightens each feature, while it speaks the soul."The.Thou need'st not, oh! my friend, thou need'st not pointHer beauties to my heart,—Each charm is her's,Softness and dignity in union sweet,And each exalted virtue. Nature form'd herThe hero's wonder, and the poet's theme.Perit.You shall not lose her, by yon' Heaven you shall not.I'll seek the king; apprise him of his danger,Unmoor my ship, remeasure back the deep,And bring the sleets of Athens to his harbour."The.It must not be; no Periander's soul"Is firm, heroic, unsubdu'd by danger."His sudden rage, his irritated pride"Will seal my doom: The deputies from Crete"Are here to claim their victim: Periander sees"Each charm, each grace of Ariadne's form,"And sends his rival hence to instant death.""Perit.I can prevent him; can elude his malice."This very night, when all is wrapt in darkness,"Embark with me. The partner of your heart"Shall be our lovely freight. I'll bear her hence"Far from the tyrant's pow'r. I'll lead you both"To Athens' happy realm, the growing school"Of laurell'd science, and each lib'ral art,"Of laws, and polish'd life, where both may shine"The pride, the lustre of a wond'ring world;"Dear to each other, and to after-times"The pattern of all truth and faithful love."The.Wretch that I am!—his ev'ry word presentsMy inward self, the horrors of my guilt.Aside.Perit.Theseus,—that alter'd look,—those sighs renew'd!Some hoarded grief,—The.Enquire no more but leave me.Perit.I cannot, will not leave thee: tell me all.Some load of secret grief weighs on thy spirit.The.There let it lodge, there swell, and burst my heart.Perit.You terrify your friend: Why heaves that groan?Why those round drops, just starting from thy eye,Which manhood combating forbids to fall?The.I see my guilt.Perit.Your guilt!The.I feel it all.Perit.If there is ought that labours in thy breast—The.Here, here it lies.Perit.To me unbosom all.The.Perithous, would'st thou think it?—Oh! my friend,I owe to Ariadne more,—alas! much moreThan a whole life of gratitude can pay.And yet—Perit.Go on: unload thy inmost thoughts;A friend may heal the wound.The.Oh! no; thou'lt scorn me,Abjure, detest, abhor me.—Wilt thou pardonThe frailties of a heart, that drives me on,Endears the crime, and yet upbraids me still?In me thou seest—who can controul his love?In me thou seest—Perit.Speak; what?The.A perjur'd villain!The veriest traitor, that e'er yet deceiv'dA kind, a generous, a deluded maid;And for his life preserv'd, for boundless love,Can only answer with dissembling looks,With counterfeited smiles, with fruitless thanks;While with resistless charms another beauty—Perit.Another! gracious pow'rs!The.She kindles allThe passions of my soul; charms ev'ry sense,And Phaedra reigns the sov'reign of my heart.Perit.Her sister Phaedra!—"and does she aspire"To guilty joys; Does she admit your love?"Does she too join you in the impious league?Will she thus wound a sister, and receiveA traitor, a deserter to her arms?The.Oa me, on me let fall thy bitt'rest censure,But blame her not.Perit.Not blame her!—Who can hearA tale like this, and not condemn you both?Th' ungen'rous act will tarnish all your fame.The.Forbear, my friend; the god of love inspir'd—Perit.Some fiend, a see to ev'ry generous instinct,A foe to all that's fair, or great in man,Infus'd the baleful poison through your soul.The.The guilt is mine: But spare, oh! spare my Phaedra,A single glance from those love-beaming eyesInfiames each thought, and hurries me to madness.Hark![Soft music is heard] Ariadne comes!—this way, my friend;Thou still canst serve me. With a lover's ardourThe King beholds her, and with earnest suitHe woes her to his throne. Let us retire;Thou still canst guide me through the maze of fate.Exeunt.SCENE II.Soft Music is heard. Enter ARIADNE, with a train of Virgins."1st.VirNow, Ariadne, now, my royal mistress,"Propitious fortune smiles, and from this day"The gods prepare a smiling train of years."Ari.I thank you, Virgins; this kind of sympathyShows you have hearts that feel another's bliss."Oh! much I thank you, virgins; yet this day"Dispels the clouds, that hover'd o'er my head."Thou source of life, thou bright, thou radiant god,Who through creation pour'st thy flood of glory,All hail thy golden orb! "Thou com'st to quell"The howling blast, to bid the tempest cease,"And after all the horrors of the night,"To cheer the face of nature!—Oh! to me"Thou com'st propitious, in thy bright career"Leading thy feltive train. The circling hours"That smile with happier omens, as they pass"Shedding down blessings from their balmy wings,"Prepare thy way rejoicing; with thee come"Bright Hope, and rose-lip'd Health, and pure delight,"And love and joy, the sunshine of the soul.""1st. Vir.Be all your hours like this: may no misfortune"O'ercloud the scene; and may you ne'er have cause"To dim the lustre of those eyes in tears."Ari.Oh, from this day! From this auspicious day,Theseus is mine; "The godlike hero's mine,"With ev'ry grace, with ev'ry laurel crown'd,"The lover's softness, and the warrior's fire."A monarch now protects him; he has pledg'd"His Royal word—But O, my love!"Swift as some God, that mounts the viewless windsAnd cleaves the liquid air, thou should'st have flownTo tell me all, to bless me with thy presence,And bid the news more joyful touch my ear,Rais'd and endear'd by that enchanting tongue."Why does he loiter thus?""1st. Virg.His friends from Greece"Perhaps detain him,""Ari."Oh! it must be so,"And without cause I chide his ling'ring stay."A ship from Greece to claim us! mighty gods!"When your displeasure smoe me, when your wrath,"Severely just, gave to my trembling lip"The cup of bitterness, to your high will"I bow'd in reverence down; I bore it all,"For Theseus' sake, I bore it all with patience;"And mid'st our sorrows, with a dawn of gladness"I sooth'd his wounded spirit; teach me now,"Oh! teach me how to bear this tide of joy,"Nor with excess of bounty try too much"A heart that melts, that languishes with love."Enter PHAEDRA.Ari.Oh! Phaedra, why this long, unkind delay?The gods restore my Theseus to my arms.Phae.If the protecting gods from Theseus' headWard off th' impending blow, none more than PhaedraWill feel the gen'ral joy. But still my fears—Ari.Suppress them all. Theseus has nought to fear.But where, where is he? whither has he wander'd?Say, tell me all, and speak to me of Theseus.In vain I ask it. "Though his name delights"My list'ning ear, yet you will never charm me"With the lov'd praises of the godlike man."On Periander's name you often dwell,In strains, that in a heart not touch'd like mine,Might stir affection.—Not a word of Theseus:Why silent thus?—it is unkind reserve.Alas, my sister, thy unruffled temperKnows not the tender luxury of love,That joys to hear the object it adoresApprov'd, admir'd of all, when ev'ry tongueGrows lavish in his praise, then, then, with ecstacyThe heart tuns over and with pride we listen.Phae.I have been just to Theseus; never wrong'd him.His fame in arms has fill'd the nations round;And purple victory in fields of deathFor him has often turn'd the doubtful scale.Ari.Unkind, ungen'rous praise! Has no one told youHis brave exploits? the number of his battles?But who can count them? Fame exalts her trump,Delighted with his name to swell the note;And victory exulting claps her wings,Still proud to follow, where he leads the way.Phae.So fame reports—With what unbounded rageHer passions kindle.—She alarms my fears.Aside.Ari.Why that averted look? Of late, my filter,Of late I've mark'd thee with dejected mien,Pensive and sad.—If aught of discontentWeighs on thy heart, disclose it all to me."In ev'ry state of life, in all conditions,"With thee I have unloaded ev'ry secret,Fled to your arms, and sigh'd forth all my care.Phae.Does Ariadne thinke my love abated?Ari.No, Phaedra, no; I harbour no mistrust.I know thy virtues:—We grew up together,Knit in the bands of love. No op'ning graceThat sparkled in thy eye, or dawn'd in mine,Could prompt the little passions of our sex.We heard each other's praise, and envy slept.And sure had Theseus, though with boundless ardourI now must love him, to distraction love him;Yet if my Theseus had first six'd on thee,I could; I think I could, have seen you happyIn his loved aims, and hero as he isI had resign'd him to you.—Why that sigh,Phaedra? way fall those tears?Phae.Forgive your sister,If still she fears for thee—Her ev'ry look,Each word she utters pierces to my heart.Aside.Ari.Speak, tell me why is this? why thus alarm me?I never had a thought conceal'd from thee.Enter THESEUS and PERITHOUS.Ari.Oh! Theseus, in thy absence ev'ry momentWas counted with a sigh. "Support me, help me"For I am faint with bliss.""The.Revive, revive;"Recall thy sleeting strength. Your counsels, Phaedra,"Will best assist her; your persuasive voice"Will charm her sense, and banish all her cares."Phae.At his lov'd sight, what new emotions rise!"Aside.The.My friend Perithous from the realms of Greece—Ari.Perithous here! the messenger from Athens!When last you sojourn'd at my father's court;(The sun has circled since his annual round)I well remember you, admir'd of all.Men heard and praised the wonder of your friendship"For Theseus, then a stranger to those eyes,"But since beheld, and ah! beheld to charm"The heart of Ariadne!—you come now"To succour our distress."Perit.In evil hourI sail'd from Greece. Would I had ne'er embark'd.Ari.My heart dies in me.—Say what new event—Theseus explain, and tell me, tell me all.The.Oh! I was born to be th' unceasing curseOf Ariadne's life; still, still indebted,Unable to repay.Ari.Thou generous man!To hear those sounds, and view thee thus before me,O'er pays me now for all my sufferings past.Enter ARCHON.Arc.Theseus, on matters of some new concern,To me unknown, your presence is required.'Tis Periander's order.The.I obey.Ari.What may this mean? yet, Theseus, ere you go—The.My friend will tell each circumstance; from himYou'll calmly hear it all. And may his voice,Soft as the breeze that pants in eastern grovesApproach your ear, and sooth your thoughts to peace.Exit with Archon.Ari.The gods will watch thy ways, and PerianderHas promis'd still to shield thy suffering virtue.Phae.I dread some mischief: Ariadne, hereWait my return: I'll follow to the palace,And bring the earliest tidings of his fate.Exit.Ari.My heart is chill'd with fear. What dark event—Can Periander—no; dishonour neverWill stain his name.—And yet that awful pause!Those looks with grief overwhelm'd!Perit.Yes, grief indeedSits heavy at my heart.—Ari.Reveal the cause;Give me to know the worst. This dread suspense—Perit.Oh! that in silence I could ever hideFrom you, from all, and in oblivion buryWhat here is lodg'd, and shakes my soul with horror!Ari.With horror! wherefore? is not Theseus safe?Does not his country claim him? Does not GreeceWith open arms expect him? Does not AthensSend you with orders to demand us both?Perit.From thence your dangers rise: the sons of Athens,A quick, inconstant, fluctuating race—Ari.Yet ever wise, heroic, gen'rous brave,All soul, all energy. Do they opposeOur nuptial union? Do they still retainTheir old hostility? Do they excludeAn alien princess from the throne of Athens?If such their will, take, take the sov'reign sway,Th' imperial diadem, the pomp of state:Let Theseus to his father's rights succeed,And reign alone; make me his wedded wise;'Tis all I ask; "the Gods can grant no more."Thrones, sceptres, grandeur! love can scorn you all.Perit.Unhappy Theseus! by disastrous fateDoom'd to betray such excellence; to seeThe fairest gift of Heaven, and spurn it from him.Aside.Ari.You answer not: speak and resolve my doubts.Pity a heart, too tenderly alive,And wild with fear, "that throbs, that aches like mine.Thy pure, exalted mild will tower aboveThe arts of mean equivocating phrase.You'll not deceive a fond, a faithful woman.Perit.None should deceive you; none. You will forgiveMy hesitating fears. I would not woundThat tender frame with aught that may alarm you.For thee my mind misgives: the fear that awes mePays homage to your virtue.Ari.And does GreeceReject the love I proffer?Perit.No, all GreeceReveres your honour'd name: Th' Athenian slateBy me demands your liberty. In termsOf earnest import I have urg'd their claim;But Periander,—to his ardent spiritYou are no stranger.—He no sooner heardThe name of Ariadne, than with fiercest rage—Perhaps you know the cause—with high disdainHe spurn'd at the demand. Some hidden motive—'Tis love perhaps—you will forgive my boldness—'Tis love, perhaps, that prompts the stern replyShould I presume once more to urge the claim,Theseus that moment must embark for Crete.So says the king: he will not brook a rival.You'll see you lover torn by russians from you;You'll see the ship bound swiftly o'er the waves;In vain you'll shriek; in vain extend your arms,And call on Theseus lost!Ari.That savage purposeThe soul of Periander will disdain.Perit.What will not love persuade? love made you flyYour father's court; and love may teach a monarchTo break all bonds, and tow'r above the laws.Ari.If this be what alarms you—Perit.Theseus' lifeOnce more depends on thee.—Ari.To save that lifeIs there an enterprise, a scene of danger,That Ariadne will not dare to meet?Perit.Your wond'rous daring on the wings of sameHas reached the nations round. But now, alas!One only way is left.Ari.Direct me to it.Perit.To Periander lend a gracious ear.For thee he sighs; for thee his vows ascend.His throne awaits thee; the imperial crown—Ari.Sir, do you know me?"Perit.Princess here to reign"In this fair island—"Ari.Do you know the spirit"That rules this breast, end o'er informs my soul?"Perit.Forgive the zeal that prompts me to this office.The king intensely loves; and in a base,Degen'rate world, frem which all truth is fled,He still may faithful prove to worth like thine.Consult with Theseus: he can best advise you.Ari.Consult with Theseus! ask his kind consent,That I may prove a traitress to my vows!Resign my Theseus!With ev'ry grace, with ev'ry laurel crown'd,The lover's softness, and the warrier's sire.—Sir, for this counsel, for this gen'rous care,Accept my thanks.—"You are too much alarm'd—"Resign my Theseus!—Oh, the gods have form'd him"With ev'ry virtue that adorns the hero!"With valour, to incite the soldier's wonder;"With ev'ry grace to charm the heart of woman."Oh! none will rival him. 'Twill be the pride"Of Periander, 'tis his highest glory,"That Theseus fld for shelter to his throne,"And met protection here."Perit.I've been to blame.Perhaps I urge too far:—Princess, farewell!May the benignant gods watch all your ways.Exit.Ari.Your fears are vain; each gloomy cloud shall vanish,Or, ting'd with orient beams of smiling fortune,With added lustre gild our various day;While o'er our heads Hymen shall wave his torch,Sooth all our cares, and brighten every joy.Exeunt.ACT III.SCENE I.Enter ARIANDE and THESEUS.Ariadne.Oh, look not thus! "those eyes that glare so pale,"Those sighs that heave as they would burst your heart,Affright my soul, and kill me with despair.Oh! banish all thy doubts, and let those eyesSmile, as when first they beam'd their softness on me."The.Alas! I'm doom'd to mourn; my thread of life"Was steep'd in tears, and must for ever run"Black and discolour'd with the worst of woes."Ari.Can thy great heart thus shrink, appall'd with fear?"Theseus, I never saw thee thus before."The.Our days of rapture and of promis'd joyFar hence are fled."Ari.No, on their rosy wings"The hours of joy and ever new delight"Come smiling on. Is this a time for fear,"When all is gay serenity around us,"And fortune opens all her brightest scenes?"The.Too soon that scene, with low'ring clouds deform'd,"Will show the sad reverse." You little knowHow Periander with resistless furyBreaks through all bounds. His passions scorn restraint.And what he wills, his vehemence of soulPursues with fierce, with unremitting ardour.To his wild fury all must yield obedience.Ari.His reign has ever been both mild and just.Fair virtue, like some god that rules the storm,Still calms the warring elements within him;And moderation with her golden curbGuides all his actions.The.Yet there is an impulse,Which with the whirlwind's unresisted rage,Roots up each virtue, and lays waste the soul.Love reigns a lawless tyrant in his heart.For thee he sighs; and sure that matchless beautyMay well inflame the passions of a prince,Who with a diadem can deck thy brow.Ari.Too well he knows the ties that bind us both.Knows you're all truth, all constancy and love.He knows the flame my virgin sighs have own'd;Knows that for thee I left my native land,Fled from my friends, and from my father's palace,And gave up all for thee. And thinks he nowHis throne, his diadem, his purple pomp,Have charms of power to lure me from thy arms?He knows his vows are lost in air: Thy heartIs Ariadne's throne.The."His fiercest passions"Break forth at once, like the deep cavern'd fire."All ties, all tender motives must give way.His resolution's six'd." Alas! this very day,Unless for ever I renounce thy love,His jealous rage sends me hence bound in chains,To die a victim on the Cretan shore.Ari.He will not dare it; no, so black an outrageHis heart will ne'er conceive. Should he persist,Should malice goad him on. I too can flyThis barb'rous shore; with unextinguish'd loveThrough every region, every clime attend thee;Follow your fortunes, if the fates ordain it,Ev'n to my father's court; there prostrate fall.And clasp his hand, and bathe it with my tears.Nor cease with vehemence of grief to melt him,Till he release thee to these circling arms,"Approve my choice, and show thee to the people,"The adopted heir, the rising sun of Crete."The.By yielding me, his rival is destroy'd;And by that act his proud ambition hopesTo sooth your father's irritated pride,And mould him to his wish.Ari.Can PerianderHarbour that black intent? "and does he mean"To prove at first a villain and a murderer,"And then aspire to Ariadne's love?"No, Theseus, no; he will not stoop so vilely:I've heard you oft' commend him; oft' my sisterEmploys whole hours with rapture in his praise.He is her constant theme. Her partial voiceEv'n above thine exalts his fav'rite name."She dwells on each particular; in peace"His milder virtues, his great fame in arms:"How, when he talks, fond admiration listens:"And each bright princess hears him, and adores."The.Not envy's self, howe'er his pride inflam'd"May deal with me, can overshade his glory."Rnown in war is his; the softer virtues"Of mild humanity adorn his name."The polih'd arts of peace, and every muse"Attune to finer sentiments his soul."His throne is fix'd upon the firmest basis"Of wisdom, and of justice. There to shine"The partner of his heart, his soft associate"In that bright scene of glory, well may prompt"In ev'ry neighbouring state the virgin's sigh,"And wake the ambition of each monarch's daughter."Ari.The strain, the rapture that to me in secret"My sister Phaedra pours the live-long day,"Enamour'd of his name! Perchance you've heard her,"And mark'd the heaving sigh, and seen the blush"That glow'd with conscious crimson on her cheek."Oh! if she cherishes the tender flame,"With maiden coyness veil'd, and pines in love,"Beauty like her's may fire a monarch's heart,And Periander, without shame or guilt,Without a crime, may woe her to his arms.To see her happy, to behold my PhaedraCrown'd with a monarch's and a people's love,Would be the pride of Ariadne's heart.The.Oh, it were misery, the worst of woes.Aside.Ari.Why do you start? why that averted look?If you approve their nuptials, freely tell me:With Periander I can plead her cause,Paint forth each charm of that accomplish'd mind,"'Till the king glow with rapture at the sound."The.Oh, this would plunge me in the worst despair!Aside.It must not be!—Has not Perithous told you—Ari.Perithous is your friend.—Perhaps to drawThe tie still closer, you would see him bless'dIn Phaedra's arms.—Tell me your inmost thoughts.If such your will, what will I not atempt.To sooth to dear delight a mind like thine?Phaedra will listen to me; mutual loveHas so endear'd us, from our tend'rest years"Has so encreas'd, and with our growth kept pace,"That we have had one wish, one heart, one mind.—My voice with Phaedra will have all the powerOf soft persuasion: her exalted meritWill bless your friend and brighten all his days.The.Oh, the bare image fires my brain to madness!Aside.Alas! this dream of happiness—Ari.What meansThat sudden cloud? and why that lab'ring sigh?Oh, let my sister to Perithous' vowsYield her consent, and bless him with her beauty:Together then we'll seek the realms of Greece;There in sweet union see our growing lovesSpring with new rapture, share each other's bliss,And by imparting multiply our joys.Enter ARCHON.Arc.With thee, fair princess, Periander cravesAnother interview: He enters nowThe palace garden.Ari.Does he there require My presence?Arc.Where you deign to give him audience,He will attend you.The."It were best go forth."His virtues claim respect; and Oh, rememberMy fate, my happiness on thee depend.Ari.Trust Ariadne, trust your fate with me.Aside.Arc.The Cretan princess, with resistless passion.Inflames his fierce desires. My boding fearsForesee some dire event.The.A glance from herWill sooth his rage, and all may still be well.When love resistless fires the noble mind,Th' effects, though sudden, from that gen'rous source,Are oft' excus'd; the errors of our nature,The tender weakness of the human heart.Arc.Errors that influence the public weal,His rank prohibits.—"Let his vices be"(If vices he must have) obscure and private,"Unfelt by men, leaving no trace behind."It were unjust, that his unbounded fury"Should tear thee from the arms of her you love."The."But when a monarch"—Ha! Perithons comes.Enter PERITHOUS.Perit.Theseus, I sought thee.—Archon, does your kingRelent? or must confed'rate Greece send forth.Her fleets and armies to support her rights?Arc.The miseries of war my feeble voiceShall labour to prevent. Theseus, farewell.Archon is still your friend. With Ariadne,Ere long, I trust, you may revisit Greece.Exit.The.With her revisit Greece! Why all this zealFor Ariadne? Who has tamper'd with him?Why not convey her to her father's court?Why not invite her to the throne of Naxos?Why all this busy, this officious careTo torture me? to foil his sovereign's love?To send far hence the idol of his heart,And blend her fate with mine?Perit.Her fate with thineSo close is blended, nothing can divide them.Truth, honour, justice, gratitude combineEach tender sentiment; they form a chain,An adamantine chain, indissoluble, firm,And strong as that which from the throne of JoveHangs down to draw to harmony and unionThis universal frame.The.It this my friend?Perit.Your friend, who scorns to flatter;Who dares avow th' emotions of his heart.Oh! Theseus, we have long together walkedThe paths of virtue, upright, firm in honour;And shall we now decline? and shall we nowWiih fraud, with perfidy, with blackest perfidy,For eVer damn our names?"The.This stern reproof"Is not the language the time now demands."'Tis thine, my friend, to soften my distress;"To pour the balm of comfort o'er my sorrows,"And sooth the anguish of a wounded mind."Oh! step between me and the keen reproaches"Of injur'd beauty; save me from myself;"From Ariadne save me!"Perit.Is it thus,"Oh! rash deluded man!" and is it thusWith high disdain you spurn that rarest beauty,That fond, believing, unsuspecting fair?"The."Have you not painted to her dazzled fancy"The splendor of a throne, that here awaits her?"Perit.So generous, so unbounded is her love,"She seeks but thee, thee only. Pomp and splendor"Are toys that sink, and fade away before her."The.Then tell her all the truth: tell her at once,"Another flame is kindled in my heart,"And fate ordains she never can be mine."Perit.Will that become Perithous? that the task"Thy friendship would impose? Must I proclaim"To th' astonished world, my friend's dishonour?"Must I with cruelty, with felon purpose,"Approach that excellence, that beauteous form,"And for her gen'rous love, for all her virtue,"Fix in her tender breast the sharpest pang,"With which ingratitude can stab the heart?"The.Why wilt thou goad me thus? 'tis cruelty;'Tis malice in disguise.—Forbear, forbear;Assist your friend in the soft cause of love,Involuntary love, that hold's enslavedThe fetter'd will.Perit.Involuntary love!Beware, beware of the deceitful garbThat vice too oft' assumes.—There's not a purposePrompting to evil deeds, that dares appearIn it's own native form. The first approach,With bland allurements, with insidious mien,Wears the delusive' semblance of some virtue.The Siren spreads her charms, and fancy lendsHer thousand hues to deck the lurking crime.Opinion changes; 'tis no longer guilt;'Tis amiable weakness, generous frailty,Involuntary error. On we rushBy fatal error led, and thus the language,The sophistry of vice deludes us all.The.Perithous, 'tis in vain: in vain you strive,By subtle maxims, and by pedant reasoningTo talk down love, and mould it to your will.It rages here like a close pent-up fire;And think'st thou tame advice can check it's course,And soothe to rest the fever of the soul?Perit.And wilt thou thus, by one ungen'rous deed,Blast all thy laurels, and give up at onceTo shame and infamy thy honour'd name?The.Woul'dst thou destroy my peace of mind for ever?Perit.I would preserve it. Would'st thou still enjoyTh' attesting suffrage of the conscious heart?The road is plain and level: live with honour.Be all your deeds, such as become a man:'Tis that alone can give th' unclouded spirit,The pure serenity of inward peace.All else is noisy fame; the giddy shoutOf gazing multitudes that  expires,And leaves our laurels, and our martial gloryTo wither and decay. By after timesThe roar of fond applause no more is heard.The triumph ceases, and the hero thenFades to the eye: the faithless man remains.The.Was it for this you spread your sails from Greece?To aggravate my sorrows?—If a monarchWoes  to his throne and bed;If I resign her to imperial splend,Where is my guilt?

Seek thou the harbour,Unmoor the ship; let all things be prepar'dTo give the spreading canvass to the wind.The day declines, and the moon's silver beamPlays on the trembling wave. This night 'tis fixedTheseus with me shall seek the Cretan shore.Exit Officer.Enter ARIADNE.Ari.Where is your prisoner?Al.In yon' tow'r secur'd.Ari.Your policy has fail'd; release him straight:Tis the king's order; you may read it, sir.Gives him a Paper.Al.Your interest has prevail'd, and I obey.Exit.Ari.Ye fond ideas, ye fierce warring passions,With what a mingled sway you drive me on!Gries, rage, and indignation rise by turns;But love flows in, and resolution dies.Ha! see he comes—Oh! how this flutt'ring tumult,With hopes and fears alternate, shakes my frame.Enter THESEUS.Ari. [viewing him as he advances]Dissimulation fails him, and his looksNo longer hide the characters of guilt.The.How shall I pour my thanks? a thousand sentimentsAll press at once, and yet deny me utterance.Words are too poor: expression strives in vain.Ari.You need no more dissemble—sir, I've heard "Periander"Has heard the purpose of your soul. Last night,"When sleep seal'd ev'ry eye, in darkness wrapt,"Thro' secret ways, clandestine as your thoughts,"You stele into his presence; there disclos'd"Year hidden flame, your alienated heart.—turns from him.The.Spare your reproaches, princess; Oh! forbear,Forbear in pity to afflict a mindToo deeply wounded! that feels all it's errors,Feels all your virtues, and with keenest senseAches at it's own reflections.Ari.Of the pardonWhich Periander to my pray'rs has granted,You know not the extent. To-morrow's funShall light you to your nuptials; you may thenShew to the world this unapparent beauty,And give to her the vows that once were mine.The.Oh! Ariadne, spare this keen reproof!Could you but know the pangs that struggle here—Ari."Theseus, you weep! you weep o'er my afflictions;"You feel my wrongs, yet barb'rous ev'n in pity,"You fix the shaft of anguish in my heart!The."On me, on me the weight of ruin falls;"'Tis I am plung'd in woe; a man condemn'd,"To wander o'er the world." Alas, 'tis fate,Fate drives me on. If you forget a wretch,The prey of grief, the sport of fortune's malice:And if a monarch, to reward your virtues,Prepares th' imperial wreathe to deck your brow—Ari.Is that the recompence I wish'd to gain?"Too well you know this heart. Had Periander"A wider empire than e'er monarch rul'd,"And you were helpless, destitute of fortune,"I had been, heav'n can witness! happy with you."In loving you, I sought yourself alone,The."For all this waste of generous affection,"Calamity is all that Theseus brings.Ari.Come lead me hence to some far distant wild,Where human footstep never prints a trace?There bless'd with thee I could for ever dwell,"Thron'd in thy heart, the mistress of thy love."The.Here happiness awaits you; here you're destin'd"The mild vicegerent of the gods on earth."In that bright sphere while you serenely shine,"The pattern of all virtue, temp'ring justice"With mercy, and diffusing blessings round you,"With tears of joy mankind will own your sway.Ari.Oh, vile ingrate!"The.If you wid deign to hear me:"Though great my crimes—"Ari."Thou traitor!—was it thus"You look'd and talk'd, when first I saw and lov'd?"Your doom was fix'd; the officers of vengeance"Remorseless led you forth; my trembling eye"Pursued your steps; tears gush'd; I could not speak."I fled to your relief, and my undoing:"Then ev'ry god was witness to your vows."The fond delusion charm'd me. I rebell'd"Against my father; I betray'd his honour;"And all for thee. I fled my native land."Nor winds, nor waves, nor exile could debar me."This the return!—have I deserv'd it of you?"Tell me my crime; and, oh! if possible"Teach me to think 'tis justice that I suffer;"For ev'n in ruin I would not abhor thee."The.You wrong me much: By yon bright stars I swear,I never meant by base ingratitudeTo fix affliction in that bosom-softness.Thy name, thy merit, and thy wondrous goodness,While life informs this frame, shall ever liveEsteem'd and honour'd, treasur'd in my heart.Ari.Esteem'd and honour'd!—'twas your love you promis'd.A monarch, saidst thou, woes me to his arms!—What truth, what fair return have I to give him?Give me, barbarian! give me back my heart,The heart you robb'd me off:—Give back my vows,My artless vows, my pure unpledg'd affections,With equal warmth that I may meet his love;And not like thee, with treach'rous bland allurements,Courts his embrace, and charm him to betray.The.Then if you will, wreak your worst vengeance on me.Ascend the throne; back to the Cretan shoreConvey me hence to glut your father's rage:I there can die content. Or if your mercyPermit me once again to visit Greece,Oft I shall hear of Ariadne's name;Well pleas'd at distance, in the humble valeOf private life, or in the tented field,To view the radiant glory that surrounds you,And thank the gods for shedding blessings downOn thee and all thy race.Ari.Ay, visit Greece;Display to Athens all your brave exploits,Your battles won, the nations you have conquer'd.And let your banners, waving high in air,Hold forth the bright inscription to men's eyes,Lo, this is he who triumph'd o'er a woman.'My death will blazon forth the fame of him,Who freed the world from monsters of the desert,Who slew the minotaur, but could not quellIngratitude, that monster of the soul.The.You need not, Ariadne, Oh, you need notThus tear me piece-meal. My distracted heartFeels in each nerve, and bleeds at every vein.Ari.Unbidden tears, why will you fool me thus!These tears that fall, that thus gush out perforce,Are not the tears of supplicating love:—They are the tears of burning indignation,Of shame, and rage, and pride, and conscious virtue;Virtue that feels, feels at the very heartEach stab inhuman treachery has given,Yet fees that calm tranquillity in guilt.See me no more; to-morrow spread your sails.But take not, Sir, the partner of your heart;—No,—dare not, on thy life, convey her hence.Go, sail for Athens,Alone, heart-broken, comfortless; like mePlung'd in despair.Farewell, for ever, Oh, ungrateful man?Enter PHAEDRA,Phae.Once more restor'd to liberty and life.To The.The.Oh, death were happiness to what I feel!"Ari.See me no more; to-morrow spread your sails;"Take in your train the partner of your heart.—"She shall not go:—once more I'll see the king,"And dare not on thy life convey her hence."Phae.What meddling fiend inflames you thus to madness?"Hear, Ariadne, hear.—"Ari.Go, sail for Athens,To The."Alone, heart-broken, comfortless; like me"Plung'd in despair; like me, depriv'd of all"Your heart held dear."Phae.Let me appease your wrath."Ari.I will descend to pray'rs and tears no more."Farewell for ever; Oh, ungrateful man!Exit."The."Distraction!—madness!—Oh, she has destroy'dMy peace of mind for ever!Phae.Theseus, no:—My lenient care shall mitigate your grief.The.For thee, my Phaedra, I bear all for thee.—Since liberty is mine, let me employ itTo serve our mutual bliss. The time admitsNo dull delay. This moment I must leave thee.Phae.Ah!—whither do you go?The.Observe me well.That path that winds along the barren heath,Leads to the mountain's ridge: there down the steepA soft declivity will guide your stepsTo Neptune's temple, shelter'd in the grove.There I expect you.Phae.Wherefore?—what intent?—Unfold the dark design; my fears alarm me.The.No more;—the fun descends, and fable nightDraws o'er the face of things her dusky veil.With cautions step proceed; but, ere you go,Watch Ariadne:—here beguile her stay,If she pursues me, all is lost for ever.Farewell, farewell, I trust my fate with thee.Exit.Phae.Oh, how my bosom pants with doubt and fear!What may this mean?—some dread event impends.He will not—no—preserve him, gracious powers!Let him not, prompted by despair, attemptBeyond his strength, and rush on sure destruction.Enter ARIADNE.Ari.Where, Phaedra, whither is the traitor fled?Phae.Oh, you have been to blame!—with hagard eyesUpturn'd to Heaven, he paus'd, and heav'd a sigh,As if his lab'ring heart would burst his frame,And leave him hore, a pale, a breathless corpse,At length with haste, with fury in his look,But blessing still your name rush'd along,And vanish'd from my sight.Ari.The barb'rous man!Did he deny his falsehood? Did one tearSpeak his cumpunction? Did he once relent?In guilt obdurate! did you mark his mien,The pride, the scorn that darted from his eye?Phea.What choice was left him, when with fierce disdainyou spurn'd him from you?Ari.Therefore did he shun me?Ungen'rous man! he saw I lov'd him most,Then when enrag'd I pour'd my curses on him:My heartstrings even then were twin'd about him.Once more I'll see him: should he sail for Athens,'Tis fix'd to follow him. "He will not then"Dare to avow a treachery like this."His glory is at stake: with one accord"All hearts declare for me. The sons of Greece,"For all my sorrows, all my sufferings past,"Wish to reward me in their hero's arms".Phae.And does Perithous join you? does he meanTo waft you o'er the deep?Ari.His ship alreadyFrom last night's storm resitted, courts the breeze,And even now prepares to plough the deep.Phae.Theseus, the while, in pining discontent,Forlorn and wretched on the blasted heath,Sighs to the winds, and drinks his falling tears.Ari.Oh, fly, pursue him! calm his troubled spirit!"Still, traitor as he is, he may relent."For Oh, too well I know his godlike nature;"Know the mild virtues that adorn his mind,"And more than speak in each enchanting look."Go seek him, Phaedra: tell him all my woes,And reconcile his heart to love and me.—But hark!—some step this way—Phae.Perithous comes."Ari.Haste—fly—pursue him—find the barbarous man.""Phae."I leave you now.Ari.Farewell.Phae.Where shall we meet?Ari.In yonder palace.Phae.There you may expect me.Exit.Ari.Oh, grant her power to touch, to melt his heart!Enter PERITHOUS.Perit.I bring you tidings may revive your hopes.—Theseus may still be thine.Ari.May still be mine!Perit.Yes:—Periander, should he still persistTo hold you here a captive, sees his danger.Crete arms against him: Athens too will claim you.And let destruction loose. To cope with both,Not even the soul of Periander dares.He must release you: then you sail for Greece.Theseus will there be yours: his solemn vow's,And the vast debt of gratitude he owes,Join'd by the public voice, will bind him to you.Ari.But if constraint alone—Ah! can you thinkThat his relenting heart will feel remorse?"Perit.The indignation of mankind will warn him."Returning virtue then—"Ari.If aught can waken"A spark of love in that obdurate breast;"A look, a sigh, impassion'd from the heart,Will heal my sorrows, and, with tears of joy.Make me forgive him all. I burn once moreTo wander with him o'er the roaring deep.—And his the king consented?Perit.Ev'n now I left himIn close debate, and onward to this spotBending his eager step. With friendly counselsArchon attends, and seconds all I wish.Lo, where he comes this way. Retire a while:Yon' grove will give you shelter: there remain.A single glance from those persuasive eyesMay once again inflame his fierce desires,And reason then will plead your cause in vain.Ari.May all your words sink melting to his soul!Exit.Perit.Now, gods, assist me! If I now succeed,My fears subside, and danger is no more.Enter PERIANDER.Perian.Perithous, hear: this hour ends all debate.My resolution's fix'd: then urge no moreYour haughty claim: 'tis torture to my heart.Perit.A heart like thine will generously love.You will not force the princess to your arms,Nor light with Hymen's torch the flames of war.Perian.Ha! dost thou deem me of so fierce a spirit,To tyrannize the fears of Ariadne?No, —her own lip, the music of that voice,To my delighted ear shall breathe the promise,The soft avowal of our mutual flame.Perit.She doats on Theseus: the wide world has heardThe story of her love. And can you hopeTo turn away the current of affectionFrom him, who first awak'd her young desires,Still fans the flame, and lords it o'er her soul?Perian.Let him depart: I have releas'd him to you.Then Ariadne will resent her wrongs,Incline her heart, and listen to my vows.Bear your friend hence: my orders shall be issued.For Ariadne trouble me no more.Exit.Perit.Proud monarch, go! This night shall mar your hopes▪This very night, while sleep lulls all your guards,She shall embark. When lawless pow'r prevails,The noble end must justify the means.Enter ARIADNE.Ari.Thou generous man! hast thou regain'd my freedom?Perit.This very night we quit the hated shore.Enquire no more: you must embark with me.—For Theseus, he will gladly join our flight.Ari.All things invite us! from the sky bursts forthA stream of radiance, and the level mainPresents a wide expanse of quivering light.Where is my sister?Perit.She must here remain.Ari.No, it were perfidy, a breach of friendship.She fled with me: our hearts were ever join'dBy the sweet ties of friendship and of love.Perit.Here she must stay; your happiness requires it.Ari.What is her crime? Ah, why should we desert her!Perit.Seek not to know too much.Ari.No, Phaedra, no;I cannot leave thee here.Enter ARCHON.Ari.This very momentA soldier from the harbour brings this letter.To you it it address'd.Gives a letter to Perit.Perit.And comes from Theseus.Ari.From Theseus!—wherefore?—whence?—what new event?Perit. [Reads.]'My heart's too full to vent itself in words.'I know my conduct will be blam'd by all.'I will not varnish it with vain excuse.'I seiz'd your ship: we have already pas'd'The head-land of the harbour'.Oh! this consummates all.Ari.Why dost thou pause?Proceed; go on; let me drink deep of horror.[Taking the letter, endeavours to proceed, but cannot.

Why, holy powers!"Why leave poor mortals crawling here below,"Where there's no confidence, no truth, no faith!"All nature moves by your eternal law;"Truth is the law of man, and yet she's fled."I see her there—there near the throne of Jove,"Her garments white as her own candid mind;"She looks with pity on this vale of error,"And drops a tear: while falsehood in disguise,"With specious seeming; walks her deadly round,"And mask'd in friendship, where she smiles, destroys."Perian.Let me conduct you: trust your friends."Ari.You lookAs if I might believe you: so did Theseus;But where, where is he now?—'To Ariadne'Be every duty paid, each tender care!'Oh! artful man!—Look there! I see him still;I see the ship; it lessens to my view,It lessens still! and now, just now it fades!It fades away, it melts into the clouds!Scarce, scarce perceiv'd! 'tis gone, 'tis lost,For ever, ever lost! is that the last,The last sad glimpse? and must I linger here?Die, Ariadne, die, and end your woes.Stabs herselfPerian.Oh! fatal rashness! quick, bring every help!Perit.Deep in her veins the poniard drinks her blood.Ari.'Twas Theseus' gift: his best, his kindest present;As such I sheath'd it in my very heart."Perian.Her flutt'ring soul is on the wing to leave her."Ari.Elysium is before me; let not Theseus"Pursue me thither; in those realms of bliss"Let my departed spirit know some rest."Oh! let me feel ingratitude no more."Keep Theseus here in this abode of guilt;"This world is his; let him remain with Phaedra;"Let him be happy—no, the fates forbid it:"They will deceive each other."Perian.Ah! that wound,Pours fast the stream of life.Ari.It gives no pain.It is the stab fell persidy has given,That rankles here. Oh! raise me, raise me up."No, let me see the light of heaven no more."Perithous, you behold your friend's exploit!I thank you, Periander; you have beenKind, good, and tender. May some worthier bride,Adorn'd with all that virtue adds to beauty,Endear the joys of life.—Alas, I die!No mother here with pious hand to closeMy faded eyes; no father o'er my urnTo drop a tear, and soothe my pensive shade."No; I deserve it; I betray'd them both."The barb'rous man!—He stabb'd me to the heart!"And yet even then I knew but half my wrongs."And you too, Phaedra!—Oh!Dies.Perian.She's gone, and with her what a noble mind!What gen'rous virtues are there laid in ruin!Perit.Thou injur'd innocence! oppress'd with wrongs,And sore beset, there rests thy languish'd head.Oh! when the gods bestow on mortal manThat bloom of beauty, those exalted charms,By virtue dignified, they give the best,The noblest gift their bounty has in store:A gift to be esteem'd, ador'd by all;To be protected by the soldier's valour,Not thus betray'd, abandon'd to despair,And the keen pangs of ill requited love.Exeunt Omnes.PROLOGUE.WRITTEN BY I. P. KEMBLE. Spoken by Mr. WROUGHTON.WHENE'ER the Poet, in retiring vein,Proclaims his purpose ne'er to write again,The threaten'd Town interprets the kind way,And takes an interest in his next last play.Not that our Bard has play'd you fast and loose.Or pleads this general candour for excuse;He dares not trifle with the public sense,But thinks such folly downright impudence;Brought, not advancing, since he then appears,To risk the well won fame of forty years,He trusts distinct indulgence you' ll afford—Not he, but Ariadne, breaks his word.From ancient stores we take our plot to-night,Form'd on the mournful tale of Theseus' flight;The time, that golden Aera, some relate,When equal Minos rul'd the Cretan state.Hail, holy Sage! who taught'st licentious manTo find his freedom where the laws began;Whose fame in arms, redoubted from afar,From thine own shores deter'd invasive war—Whilst thy mild genius o'er a prosperous isleGave every good and every grace to smile;'Till thine to all thy subjects were as dear,As George's virtues to his Britons here.To all our author bids me humbly bend,But deprecate no foe, end court no friend:With grateful pride he thinks of honors past,And hopes you 'll bid those valu'd honors last.Freely to you he now commends his cause—Should he deserve—you'll not withhold applause.EPILOGUELADIES—though scarce alive—quite out of breath,I come—to talk a little after death;When tir'd of woe, and daggers, and all that,Nothing revives us like a little chat.Now—so the laws of Epilogue ordain,All should be turn'd to jest, and flippant strain;And I, with points most miserably witty,Should play the mimic, and lampoon the city.Far other motives bid me now appear;Far other sentiments are struggling here:I come to view this circle, fair and bright,And thank you for each tear you've shed to-night;The tear, that gives the soft endearing grace;Virtues cosmetic for the loveliest face;That shows the features in their genuine hue,Like roses blushing through the morning dew.Ye men, —ye boasted lords of the creation,Who give your Ariadnes such vexation;May I approach you, pray? and may I dareAsk why you droop?—and why that languid air?'Tis sympathy in guilt; and Theseus' caseWith rising blushes crimsons ev'ry face;Ceusure on fraud like his, you own, must fall:Too well you know—he represents you all.And yet you've same excuse; these modish daysLend a few tints to varnish all your ways.When a GRAND SWEEPSTAKES to Newmarket calls.And FIVE TO FOUR each groom, each jockey bawls:What beauty then can lure you from the course,And hope—you'll love her BETTER than year HORSE?When to the Club the gaming rage invites,And fascinating FARO claims your nights;The tender passion then intrudes no more,And FORTUNE is the VENUS you adore.But is she constant?—Loss on loss ensues,And bonds, and mortgages, attorneys, Jews:Love then may well his softer rights forego,Spread his light wings, and fly the scene of woe.But now the times a nobler plea may yield;A War invites you;—arm, and take the field.The SONS OF FRANCE would fain subvert your laws;Go forth the champions of your country's cause.Behold the bright example of the day,Go—where our ROYAL FREDERICK leads the way;So Albion's liberties secure shall stand,And KING, and LORDS, and COMMONS guard the land.
