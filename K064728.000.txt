THE APPRENTICE. A FARCE, IN TWO ACTS, As it is Perform'd at the THEATRE-ROYAL, in Drury-Lane.By Mr. MURPHY.LONDON. Printed for PAUL VAILLANT, facing Southampton∣street, in the Strand. 1756.[Price One Shilling.]ADVERTISEMENT.THERE was Room to apprehend, be∣fore the Representation of the following Farce, that the Subject might appear extravagant and merely ideal; but the real ex∣istence of it is displayed in such a lively and picturesque Manner by the Author of the Prologue, and was at once so universally felt by the Audience, that all necessity of saying any thing farther on this Head is now entirely superseded. What at present remains to be feared, is, that the Apprentice will not make so lively a figure in the closet, as on the Stage, where the Parts in general were allow∣ed to be well performed; where Simon was re∣presented with a perfection of folly, where the Skill of Mr. Yates exhibited the Impo∣tence of a Mind, whose Ideas extend very little beyond the multiplication Table, and whose Passions are ever in a crazy Conflict, unless when they all subside into a sordid Love of Gain; and where Mr. Woodward's admirable comic Genius gave such a Spirit to the whole, that there is Reason to think, when∣ever he relinquishes the Part, the Apprentice may again elope from his Friends, without any one's desiring him to Return to his Business.The Author has however endeavoured to render all its Defects as excusable as he could, and he wishes no stronger Criticism could be brought against him, than the two following Observations, which he thinks very singular and somewhat entertaining. I can't, says one, give my Opinion of the Piece, till I have
Time to consider the Depth of it—Po! says another, this is not all his OWN, I remember some of it in other Plays.—In order to assist the former in his deep Researches, and to enable the latter to make good his charge of Plagia∣rism, References are made to the several Plays, from which the distempered Hero of the piece makes up his motley, but characteristick Dia∣lect. The intelligent Reader, if he think it worth his while to turn over these Leaves, will be pleased to remember that a Parody does not always carry with it a Burlesque on the Lines al∣luded to. For (as it is judiciously remarked in a note to Mr. Pope's Dunciad) It is a common, but foolish, mistake that a ludicrous Parody of a grave and celebrated Passage; is a Ridicule of that Passage. A Ridicule indeed there is in every Parody, but where the Image is transfer∣red from one Object to another, there the Ri∣dicule falls not on the Thing imitated, but imitating. Thus for Instance, whenA Line of pope's in a ludicrous Account of the coronation in Henry the VIIIth.Old Edward's Armour beams on Cibbers Breast. It is without Doubt an Object ridiculous enough; but then, I think, it falls neither on old King Edward, nor his Armour, but on his Armour-Bearer only.But this is prefacing a Farce as if it were a Thing of moment; I shall therefore dismiss it to the Press, without adding any Thing far∣ther, except my grateful Acknowledgements for the very favourable Reception, with which the Public has honoured the trifling Scenes ofTheir most obliged and most obedient Servant, ARTHUR MURPHY.Tavistock Row5th Jan. 1756.PROLOGUEwritten by Mr. GARRICK,spoken by Mr. MURPHY, dressed in Black.BEhold a Wonder for Theatric Story!The Culprit of this Night, appears before ye.Before his Judges dares these Boards to tread,"With all his Imperfections on his Head!"Prologues precede the Piece,—in mournful Verse;As Undertakers — walk before the Hearse.Whose doleful March may strike the harden'd Mind,And wake it's feelings — for the Dead — behind.Trickt out in Black thus Actors try their Art,To melt that Rock of ROCKS, — the Critic's Heart.No acted Fears my Vanity betray;I am indeed, — what others only play.Thus far myself — The Farce come next in View;Tho' many are it's Faults, at least 'tis NEW.No smuggled, pilfer'd Scenes from France we show,'Tis English — English, Sirs! — from Top to Toe.Tho' Coarse my Colours and my Hand unskill'd,From real life my little Cloth is fill'd.My Hero is a Youth, — by Fate design'dFor culling simples, — but whose Stage-struck Mind,Nor Fate could rule, nor his Indentures bind.A Place there is where such young Quixots meet;'Tis call'd the SPOTING-CLUB;—a glorious Treat!Where Prentic'd-Kings — alarm the Gaping Street!Three Brutus starts and stares by midnight Taper;Who all the DAY enacts — a Woollen Draper.There Hamlet's Ghost stalks-forth with doubl'd Fist▪Cries out with hollow Voice, — List, List, O List"And frightens Denmark's Prince— a young Tobacconist.The Spirit too, clear'd from his deadly White,Rises — a Haberdasher to the Sight!Not young Attorneys — have this Rage withstood,But change their Pens for TRUNCHEONS, Ink for BLOOD;And (Strange Reverse!) —die for their Country's Good.Thro' all the Town this Folly you may trace;Mself am Witness — 'tis a common Case.I've further Proofs, could ye but think I wrong ye;—Look round — you'l find some Spouting Youths among ye.To check these Heroes, and their Laurels crop,To bring 'em back to Reason, — and their SHOP,To raise an harmless Laugh was all my Aim,And if I shun Contempt, — I seek not FAME.Indulge this Firstling, — let me but BEGIN,Nor nip me — in the Buddings of my Sin;Some Hopes I cherish — in your SMILES I read 'em;Whate'er my Faults, — your Candor can exceed 'em.EPILOGUEwritten by a FRIEND,spoken by Mrs. CLIVE.[Enters reading the Play-Bill.]A Very pretty Bill, — as I'm alive!The Part of — Nobody — by Mrs. Clive!A paltry, scribling Fool — to have me out —He'll say perhaps — he thought I could not spout.Malice and Envy to the last Degree!And why? — I wrote a Farce as well as He.And fairly ventur'd it, — without the AidOf Prologue dress'd in black, and Face in Masquerade;O Pit — have Pity — see how I'm dismay'd!Poor Soul! — this canting Stuff will never do,Unless, like Bay's, he brings his Hangman too.But granting that from these same Obsequies,Some Pickings to our Bard in black arise;Should your Applause to Joy convert his Fear,As Pallas turns to feast — Lardella's Bier;Yet 'twould have been a better Scheme by halfT'have thrown his Weeds aside, and learn't with me to laugh.I could have shewn him, had he been inclin'd,A spouting Junto of the Female Kind.There dwells a Milliner in yonder Row,Well-dress'd, full-voic'd, and nobly built for Shew,Who, when in Rage, she scolds at Sue and Sarah,Damn'd, Damn'd Dissembler! — thinks she's more than ZARA.She has a Daughter too that deals in Lace,And sings — O Ponder well — and Cherry Chase,And fain would fill the fair Ophelia's Place.And in her cock't up Hat, and Gown of Camblet,Presumes on something — touching the Lord Hamlet.A Cousin too she has, with squinting Eyes,With wadling Gait, and Voice like London Cries;Who, for the Stage too short by half a Story,Acts Lady Townly — thus — in all her Glory.And, while she's traversing her scanty Room,Cries — "Lord, my Lord, what can I do at home!"In short, there's Girls enough for all the Fellows,The Ranting, Whining, Starting, and the Jealous,The Hotspurs, Romeos, Hamlets, and Othellos.Oh! Little do those silly People know,What dreadful Trials — Actors undergo.Myself — who most in Hamony delight,Am scolding here from Morning until Night.Then take Advice from me, ye giddy Things,Ye Royal Milliners, ye apron'd Kings;Young Men beware and shun our slipp'ry Ways,Study Arithmetic, and burn your Plays;And you, ye Girls, let not our Tinsel trainEnchant your Eyes, and turn your madd'ning Brain;Be timely wise, for oh! be sure of this; —A Shop with Virtue, is the Height of Bliss.Speedily will be published In Two Volumes 12mo PRICE bound SIX SHILLINGS THE GRAYS-INN JOURNAL.BY Mr. Murphy.Dramatis Personae.Wingate, a passionate Old Man, particu∣larly fond of Money and Figures, and involuntarily uneasy about his Son.

As sure as any thing, Master, the Gypsies have got∣ten hold on un, and we shall have un come home as thin as Rake, — like the young Girl in the City,—with living upon nothing but Crusts and Water for six and twenty Days.—Wingate.The Gypsies have got hold of him, you Blockhead! — Get out of the Room —Here, you Simon—Simon.Sir,—Wingate.Where are you going in such a Hurry? — let me see; what must be done? —a ridiculous Numskull, with his damned Cassanders and Cloppatra's and Trumpery; with his Romances, and his Odyssey Popes, and a Parcel of Rascals not worth a Groat; — wearing Stone Buckles, and cocking his Hat; —I never wear Stone Buckles,—never cock my Hat— but, zookers, I'll not put myself in a Passion—Simon, do you step back to your Mas∣ter, my Friend Gargle, and tell him I want to speak with him — tho' I don't know what I should send for him for—a sly, slow, he∣sitating Blockhead! — he'll only plague me with his Physical Cant and his Nonsence— why don't you go you Booby, when I bid you?—Simon.Yes, Sir —Exit.Wingate.This Fellow will be the Death of me at last— I can't Sleep in my Bed some∣times for him. — An absurd insignificant Rascal, —to stand in his own Light! — Death and Fury, that we can't get Children, without having a Love for 'em!—I have been turmoiling for the Fellow all the Days of my Life, and now the Scoundrel's run away — Suppose, I advertise the Dog, and promise a Reward to any one that can give an Ac∣count of him — well, but, — why should I throw away my Money after him? — why, as I don't say what Reward, I may give

what I please when they come—ay, but if the Villain should deceive me, and happen to be dead, — why then he tricks me out of two Shillings — my Money's flung into the Fire — Zookers, I'll not put myself in a Passion—let him follow his Nose—it's nothing at all to me— what care I? — What do you come back for, Friend?—Re-enter Simon.Simon.As I was going out, Sir, the Post came to the Door, and brought this Letter.Wingate.Let me see it—The Gypsies have got hold of him! ha! ha! what a pretty Fellow you are! ha! ha! why don't you step where I bid you, Sirrah!—Simon.Yes Sir.Exit.Wingate.Well, well, —I'm resolved, and it shall be so—I'll advertise him To-morrow Morning, and promise, if he comes home, all shall be forgiven:—And when the Block∣head comes, I may do as I please—ha! ha! I may do as I please!—Let me see:—He had on—a Silver-loop'd Hat:—I never liked those vile Silver Loops:—A Silver-loop'd Hat;—and—and—Slidikins, what signifiies what he had on?—I'll read my Letter, and think no more about him.— Hey! what a Plague have we here? [mutters to himself]Bristol—a—what's all this?—Esteemed Friend,Last was 20th ultimo, since none of thine, which will occasion Brevity. The

Reason of my writing to thee at pre∣sent, is to inform thee that thy Son came to our Place with a Company of Strollers, who were taken up by the Magistrate, and committed as Vagabonds, to Jail.—Zooker's! I'm glad of it—a Villain of a Fellow! Let him lie there—I am sorry thy Lad should follow such pro∣fane Courses; but out of the Esteem I bear unto thee, I have taken thy Boy out of Confinement, and sent him off for your City in the Waggon, which left this four Days ago. He is consigned to thy Ad∣dress, being the needful from thy Friend and Servant,Ebeeneezor Broadbrim.Wounds! what did he take the Fellow out for?—a Scoundrel Rascal!—turn'd Stage-Player—I'll never see the Villain's Face.— Who comes there?—Enter Simon.Simon.I met my Master on the Way, Sir;— our Cares are over: — Here he is, Sir.—Wingate.Let him come in—and do you go down Stairs, you Blockhead.—Exit Simon.Enter Gargle.Wingate.So, Friend Gargle,—Here's a fine Piece of Work—Dick's turned Vaga∣bond!—Gargle.He must be put under a proper Regimen directly, Sir.—He arrived at my House within these ten Minutes, but in such a Trim!—He's now below Stairs—I judged it proper to leave him there, till I had pre∣pared you for his Reception.—Wingate.Death and Fire! what could put it into the Villain's Head to turn Buffoon?Gargle.Nothing so easily accounted for:—Why, when he ought to be reading the Dis∣pensatory, there was he constantly poring over Plays, and Farces, and Shakespear.—Wingate.Ay, that damned Shakespear!—I hear the Fellow was nothing but a Deer-stealer in Warwickshire:—Zookers! if they had hanged him out of the Way, he would not now be the Ruin of honest Men's Chil∣dren — But what Right had he to read Shakespear? —I never read Shakespear!—Wounds! I caught the Rascal, myself, read∣ing that nonsensical Play of Hamblet, where the Prince is keeping Company with Strol∣lers and Vagabonds: A fine Example, Mr. Gargle!—Gargle.His Disorder is of the malignant Kind, and my Daughter has taken the In∣fection from him—bless my Heart!—She was as innocent as Water-gruel, till he spoilt

her: — I found her, the other Night, in the very Fact.Wingate.Zookers! you don't say so! —caught her in the Fact! —Gargle.Ay, in the very Fact of reading a Play-book in Bed.Wingate.O, is that the Fact you mean? —is that all? — tho' that's bad enough.—Gargle.But I have done for my young Madam: — I have confined her to her Room, and locked up all her Books.Wingate.Look-ye, Friend Gargle, I'll never see the Villain's Face:—Let him follow his Nose and bite the Bridle.—Gargle.Lenitives, Mr. Wingate, — Leni∣tives are properest at present:— His Habit requires gentle Alteratives:— but leave him to my Management; —about twenty Ounces of Blood, with a Cephalic Tincture, —and he may do very well.Wingate.Where is the Scoundrel?Gargle.Dear Sir, moderate your Anger, and don't use such harsh Language.Wingate.Harsh Language! —Why do you think Man, I'd call him a Scoundrell, if I had not a Regard for him? — You don't hear me call a Stranger a Scoundrel.Gargle.Dear Sir, he may still do very well, the Boy has very good Sentiments —Wingate.Sentiment! — a Fig for Senti∣ment! let him get Money, and never miss an Opportunity—I never missed an Op∣portunity; got up at Five in the Morning, —struck a Light, — made my own Fire—worked my Finger's Ends—and this Va∣gabond

of a Fellow is going his own Way — with all my Heart— what care I? — let him follow his Nose, —let him follow his Nose—a ridiculous—Gargle.Ay, ridiculous indeed, Sir—Why for a long Time past, he could not converse in the Language of common Sense.— Ask him but a trivial Question, and he'd give some cramp Answer out of some of his Plays that had been running in his Head, and so there's no understanding a Word he says.—Wingate.Zookers! this comes of his keep∣ing Company with Wits, and be damned to 'em for Wit's—ha! ha! — Wits! a fine Thing indeed—ha! ha! Its the most beg∣garly, rascally, —contemptible Thing on Earth.—Gargle.And then, Sir, I have found out that he went three Times a Week to a Spout∣ing-Club.Wingate.A Spouting-Club, Friend Gargle!—What's a Spouting-Club?Gargle.A Meeting of Prentices and Clerks and giddy young Men, intoxicated with Plays; and so they meet in Public Houses to act Speeches; there they all neglect Business, de∣spise the Advice of their Friends, and think of nothing but to become Actors.—Wingate.You don't say so!—a Spouting-Club! wounds, I believe they are all mad.Gargle.Ay, mad indeed, Sir: — Madness is occasioned in a very extraordinary Manner, —the Spirits flowing in particular Channels.—Wingate.'Sdeath, your'e as mad yourself as any of them.—Gargle.And continuing to run in the same Ducts.—Wingate.Ducks! Damn your Ducks! — Who's below there?Gargle.The Texture of the Brain becomes disorder'd, and [Wingate walks about uneasily and Gargle follows] thus, by the Pressure on the Nerves, the Head is disturbed, and so your Son's Malady is contracted.—Wingate.Who's without there?—Don't plague me so, Man.Gargle.But I shall alter the morbid State of the Juices, correct his Blood, and produce laudable Chyle.—Wingate.Zookers, Friend Gargle, don't teaze me so—Don't plague me with your physical Nonsense.—Who's below there?—Tell that Fellow to come up.—Gargle.Dear Sir, be a little cool—In∣flammatories may be dangerous. — Do, pray, Sir, moderate your Passions.—Wingate.Prithee, be quiet, Man—I'll try what I can do — Here he comes.Enter Dick.Dick.Now, my good Father, what's the Matter?Hamlet.Wingate.So, Friend,—you have been upon your Travels, have you?—You have had your Frolic?—Look-ye, young Man,—I'll not put myself in a Passion:—But, Death and Fire, you Scoundrel, —what

Right have you to plague me in this Man∣ner?—Do you think I must fall in Love with your Face, because I am your Father?—Dick.A little more than Kin, and less than Kind. —Hamlet.Wingate.Ha! ha! —what a pretty Figure you cut now?—ha! ha!—why don't you speak, you Blockhead?—Have you nothing to say for yourself?—Dick.Nothing to say for yourself?—what an old Prig it is?Wingate.Mind me, Friend — I have found you out—I see you'll never come to Good.—Turn Stage-player!—Wounds! you'll not have an Eye in your Head in a Month — ha! ha! — you'll have 'em knocked out of the Sockets with withered Apples— remember I tell you so.—Dick.A Critic too! [whistles] Well done old Square-toes.—Wingate.Look-ye, young Man—take Notice of what I say:—I made my own Fortune, and I could do the same again. Wounds!—if I were placed at the Bottom of Chancery-Lane, with a Brush and Black∣ball, — I'd make my own Fortune again —you read Shakespear!—Get Cocker's Arith∣metic— you may buy it for a Shilling on any Stall — best Book that ever was wrote.—Dick.Pretty well, that; — Ingenious, Faith! — Egad, the old Fellow has a pretty Notion of Letters.Wingate.Can you tell how much is five Eigths of three Sixteenths of a Pound? —Five Eigths of three Sixteenths of a Pound—Ay, ay, I see you're a Blockhead:—Look-ye young Man, — if you have a Mind to thrive in this World, study Figures and make your∣self useful — make yourself useful.—Dick.Hamlet.How weary, stale, flat and unprofit∣able seem to me all the Uses of this World!—Wingate.Mind the Scoundrel now.—Gargle.Do Mr. Wingate, let me speak to him — softly, softly — I'll touch him gently:—Come, come, young Man, lay aside this sulky Humour, and speak as be∣comes a Son.Dick.Ditto.O Jeptha, Judge of Israel, what a Treasure hadst thou?—Wingate.What does the Fellow say?Gargle.He relents, Sir.—Come, come, young Man, he'll forgive.—Dick.Ditto.They fool me to the Top of my Bent.—Gad, I'll hum 'em, to get rid of 'em,—a truant Disposition, good my Lord:—No, no, stay, that's not right—I have a better Speech. — Suspicious Husband.
It is as you say—when we are sober, and reflect but ever so little on our Follies, we are ashamed and sorry; and yet, the very next Minute, we rush a∣gain into the very same Absurdities.—Wingate.Well said Lad, well said—mind me Friend: Commanding our own Passions, and artfully taking Advantage of other People's, is the sure Road to Wealth:— Death and

Fire! —but I won't put myself in a Pas∣ssion:—It's my Regard for you makes me speak; and if I tell you you're a Scoundrel, its for your Good.Dick.Without Doubt, Sir. stifling a Laugh.Wingate.If you want any Thing, you shall be provided: — Have you any Money in your Pocket? —ha! ha! what a ridiculous Numskull you are now? —ha! ha! —Come, here's some Money for you.— [Pulls out his Money and looks at it]— I'll give it to you an∣other Time; and so you'll mind what I say to you and make yourself useful for the fu∣ture.—Dick.Richard III.Else, wherefore breath I in a Christian Land!Wingate.Zookers! you Blockhead, you'd better stick to your Business, than turn Buf∣foon, and get Truncheons broke upon your Arm, and be tumbling upon Carpets.—Dick.Hamlet.I shall in all my best obey you, Sir.—Wingate.Very well, Friend, —very well said — you may do very well if you please and so I'll say no more to you, but make yourself useful, and so now go and clean yourself, and make ready to go Home to your Business—and mind me young Man, — let me see no more Play-Books, and let me never find that you wear a lac'd Waist∣coat — you Scoundrel, what right have you to wear a lac'd Waistcoat?— I never wore a lac'd Waistcoat! —never wore one
