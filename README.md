# TCP-ECCO-texts
Document level full-text of TCP transcribed ECCO docs (2188)

Added a combined doc file from Stephen Gregg for easier text analysis. However, the file is too big for git so I split it up into 3 files (TCPECCOcombined-01.txt & -02 & -03). To combine into one just do something like: "cat TCPECCOcombined-01.txt TCPECCOcombined-02.txt TCPECCOcombined-03.txt > TCPECCOcombined-ALL.txt" (from a Mac command line).
