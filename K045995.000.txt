BEW, IN PATER-NOSTER ROW. MDCCLXXVI.TO GEORGE COLMAN, Esq.SIR,AS you have done me the honour to make me the subject of your dramatic satire; in doing which, you have flown off in a direct tangent from the circle of science; you will excuse me, if, in returning the compliment, I have at any time, apparently deviated from the line of mathematical truth, in modelling the figures of poetical fiction. The force of metaphorical expressions is not to be estimated so precisely as the momentum of mechanic powers; and yet there may be as much veracity couched under the moral of an allegory as in the most demonstrable proposition of Euclid. Of this, at least, I am certain that my characters are as justly drawn and my allusions as apt and applicable as yours: Save and except,

indeed, your incomparable parallels, which, at the same time as they preserve their parallelism, diverge, with a true poetical licence, like rays from a common centreSee the Spleen, or Islington Spa.

Italia's hated clime!Where every meanness, every crimeThat Nature can debase,Where fly suspicion, foul distrust,Malice, revenge and foulest lustPollute the human race.XIII.Detested soil! where rankly growsEach vicious weed, the devil sows,To modest Nature's sorrow;'Till, swelling with avengeful ire,Earth opens wide, and liquid fireAlluding to the eruptions of Vesuvius.Pours o'er this new Gomorrah,XIV.Ev'n Stanhope's self, who taught his sonDissimulation's race to run,And act the part of Mask-all,A character in Congreve's Double Dealer.Was in his morals yet so nice,He fear'd that, in thy sink of vice,He'd prove too great a rascal.Lord Chesterfield, whose latitudinarian principles respecting morals, are well known. He looked upon the vices of France as venial in comparison with those of Italy.XV.I hail thee, as, in time of yore,Grim Satan hail'd the Stygian shore;When, from Olympus hurl'd,He took (there ever doom'd to dwell)Possession of profoundest hell;Greeting th' infernal world.Hail! Horrors! hail! and thou, profoundest Hell!Receive thy new possessor.MILTON.XVI.No greeting with complacence sweet,Where mutual gratulations meet;But hatred and disgust.I greet thee as the hell on earth,That gave our bye-blow bantling birth,Offspring of FOLLY'S lust.THE SPLEEN.

HUNTER.Her tabby cat should wean her kitten,And suckle little master.VI.This done, 'tis said, tho strange to tell,Cat's milk agreed with him so well(Congenial humours meeting)The puling thing began to mew,And frisk and play, as kittens do,Mamma and Midwife greeting.VII.FOLLY and SPLEEN, now saw, with joy,Their scratching cat-o'barnet boy,Its wet-nurse taking after.So playful was the pretty fellow,As e'en to rival Punchinello;The Macaroon of laughter!VIII.They, therefore, thought it now high timeTo change the country and the clime,And hie for England, over.Hence, tripping back again through France,They struck up a cotillon dance,And soon arrived at Dover.IX.Most opportune, the little ape.Thus made his fortunate escape.His dry-nurse, an Italian,Having (to make him sing) begunTo work on FOLLY'S favourite son,And spoil him for a stallion.This extraordinary anecdote has but lately been communicated, by one of those useful motherly females, who officiated at his nativity.BATE.This reverend annotator is mistaken, in supposing a plurality of gossips assembled at our hero's birth. He was born on FOLLY, and brought forth alone by SPLEEN; no other females attending.MARTINUS SCRIBLERIUS, junr.X.Half-made, half-marr'd, the surgeons say,The ridgil A term given to an imbecile or natural castrato. thus was brought away.—Mark but that look of his;That half a smile, that half a grin,Speaking the eunuch-soul within,His feeble-featur'd phiz!Agreeable to the phrasre "he looks as melancholy as a gibb'd cat," SCRIB.XI.At Britain's Genius spit her spite,SPLEEN now maintain'd the filial rightOf this, her favourite kitling;Presented him to's father, WIT,Who, in a gay, good-natur'd fit,Half own'd th' exotic WITLING.THE SPLEEN.

A." careless, call'd his mother whore,And Bonnel Thornton, Esq.—It is well known that our hero, in conjunction with this celebrated writer, wrote, or rather compiled, a periodical paper entitled the Connoisseur, which was first published some years past at Oxford. The latter having written a number of this work which he particularly admired, requested his colleague to go post with it to Oxford, and to correct it with his own hand. On Coley's arrival, Jackson the printer informed him, that the publication must inevitably be stopt if he had not the copy in two hours at farthest. Here was an offer of immortality the poet could not forego! He replied, that having been a bon vivant the preceding evening, he was but indifferently prepared for the task, yet if he would furnish him with a room, pen, ink and paper, he would see what could be done. Being accommodated to his wishes, he transcribed his friend Thornton's essay, and delivered it for the press in little more than an hour. Jackson was astonished at the rapidity of his genius; and this identical paper making a considerable noise in the world at that time, the printer, as in duty bound, proclaimed the velocity of his author's fancy; a circumstance which procured him that merited fame, he never after could be persuaded, or even forced to resign.BATE.This anecdote is related, with some little difference of circumstance, in the last London Review.PUFFER FOR THE LONDON REVIEWERS.Bonnel, bit, grew peevish.V.Discarded by his college chums,Alone, he pick'd up a few crumbs,For poesies, writ for cutlers;Wrote lying paragraphs for news,And verses, so reduc'd his muse!For chamber-maids and butlers.VI.To FlocktonFor FLOCKTON, read GARRICK, meo periculo,MAR.

On these occasions Justice Fielding's thief-takers and other ruffians, have been introduced by our Hero, and planted in every part of the house, to cram down his own crudities and damn the productions of others.—Were an author or actor, particularly if a manager, the greatest blockhead or scoundrel in nature, or even the most unnatural rascal imaginable, a papered house would have the power to protect him, and persuade the public his protection was due to their candour.ANONYMOUS. had turn'd his brain,The little brain still left him.When now, behold, to top her part,A stroler's strumpet Our poet has here shamefully broken through that salutary, though ancient adage, Nil nisi bonum de mortuis.

Soon after he became manager, Ross thought himself happy to engage with him, naturally expecting the turn of the seale in his favor for the civilities he had shewn him;—and so he had; for being confined with a fit of the gout and in consequence rendered incapable of playing a few nights, the manager ordered his treasurer to put him under stoppages: an instance scarce ever known before. Mr. Ross bore it with great temper, only desiring the treasurer, "to make his compliments to the manager and inform him, that the deduction was inconvenient enough at that time; but he was glad it did not take place a few years before, for if it had he and Mr. C— would have been in want of many a good dinner."BATE..XII.Snatches old Macklin's bread and butter,Which made him make so damn'd a clutter,And blasted Kenrick's bays;A little, hypocritical, lying, cowardly rascal, to pick a man's pocket of a thousand pound, before he himself had fingered a farthing of the money!

We, who know theatrical managers much better, know their manoeuvres are not always directed by such motives of duty and loyalty. We ourselves have attended both Mr. G. and Mr. C. behind the scenes, for popular paragraphs, in ridicule of their royal master; written immediately after their having obsequiously lighted him out of the theatre.THE DOERS OF THE NEWS-PAPERS.Of only entering on the sceneTo entertain the king and queen,With wish'd eclat effected.XXX.Thus puff'd our hero's quondam tutorNo more would be his coadjutor,But left poor EpicoeneMr. Colman's last comedy, altered from Ben Johnson.,To shift, as it could best, alone;While trembling, tottering, tumbling down,It dying lay with SpleenMr. C's last new comic piece..XXXI.TO PHOEBUS, Folly now applies;And, on her knees, with streaming eyes,A piteous story tells.Wisdom, she said, had got her owl;And might not she with some such fowlBedeck her cap and bells.XXXII."Oh! change my fallen foundling's nature"Into some emblematic creature,"Any, except a cat;"A smile Apollo strove to smother,And metamorphos'd, for the mother,Her son into a BatHere again we catch our poet at plagiarism. This metamorphosis is palpably stolen from the following prediction in his epitaph above-cited, written on his theatrical decease, by that exemplary divine and reverend poet Mr. Henry Bate.—Speaking of his flight to the celestial regions, his reverence prophetically suggests the same transformation. Alas! what assailants his march will oppose,Demanding their fragment each step that he goes?It the notion prove right, which our schoolmen divine,That aloft none in robes that are borrowed can shine,When each has dismantled this daw of his feather,How the devil, unfledg'd, will he waft himself thither;For fate will demand (in despite of pretences)A full expiation for all his offences;Whose shafts, left the sophist with logic should parry,Minerva's sage bird his death-warrant shall carry.Winging down, by the breech at one pounce she will take him,And soaring aloft, high in air wildly shake him.When in penance thus comic, the culprit appears,What sallies of laughter shall run thro' the spheres!Nay, as great folks love fun, one may venture the odds,But Olympus will shake with the mirth of the gods.—Thus in aether he'll swing the sole outcast of nature,'Till some kind immortal, brim full of good nature,Beholding the victim with pitiful eyes,To a BAT shall transform him—the tyrant of FLIES.O Imitatores! Servum pecus. MAR. SCRIB. Junr..XXXIII.All day, perdu, Lo! now he lies,Domitian like, in wait for flies,That cannot bear the light;Haunting, like ghosts that love to glideThrough places where their honour died,The Play-House every night!THE END.
