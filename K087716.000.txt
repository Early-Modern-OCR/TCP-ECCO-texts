And Spoken by MR. HARLEY.WHILE fears and hopes alternate thoughts suggest,And now disturb, now soothe the Author's breast;While expectation breathes an awful pause,Ere yet the ready hand the curtain draws,Ere yet the action glows—I come a spy,To cast around a reconnoit'ring eye.Yet then, as I this fearful Pit explore,Where Authors sometimes fall to rise no more,Here when th' Adventurer dares you to the field,If his fond efforts some small merit yield,I've seen your gen'rous arm forbear the blow,And raise to life and fame the grateful foe.For you, the boist'rous inmates of the sky!Bold is the man who dares your pow'r defy;With you confusion her loud compact forms,You ride the clouds, and are yourselves the storms.Yet have I seen you mitigate your rage,And spare the Adventurer struggling on the Stage;If in some scenes (the rest tho' feebly done)Unerring Nature own'd her genuine Son,Your glowing soul has grasp'd the Author's cause,And hurl'd around the thunder of applause.For you, ye glittering Amazonian train,Whose power is dreaded on the critic plain!Tho' marshal'd to the war by taste severe,Yet meek indulgence follows in the rear:And oft on beauty's cheek I've lov'd to trace,Soft stealing down, the holy tear of grace.Rais'd by the thoughts these soothing hopes create,I'll bid the Bard come forth, and meet his fate,The tyrant Terror from his breast erase,Rush on the scene, and combat for your praise.CHARACTERS.SIR ALEXANDER SEATON,Mr. POPE.ARCHIBALD his Sons,Mr. MIDDLETON.VALENTINE his Sons,Mr. HOLMAN.ANSELM, a Monk,Mr. HARLEY.DONALDSON, an Officer,Mr. MACREADY.ETHELBERTA, Wife of Sir ALEXANDER,Mrs. POPE.JULIANA,Mrs. FAWCETT.HERALD, &c.THE SIEGE OF BERWICK.ACT THE FIRST.Sir ALEXANDER, ARCHIBALD, VALENTINE.SIR ALEXANDER.IT is not action only that adornsThe soldier's character, it is patience,Calm and induring in the rugged hourOf want, that forms the nobler part of duty:You, my lov'd sons, and all your fellow-sufferers,Have well that rigorous iron task perform'd.But now a smoother train of hours advances;The truce, which at to-morrow's dawn takes place,Will enable me from out the northern gateTo dismiss the women, the aged and the infirm,Then disencumber'd of its useless numbersThis foe-encircled town shall raise its head;The hand of scarceness shall no more dispenseHer meagre morsel to th' exhausted soldier,But cheering competency shall provideThe meal.ARCHIBALD.'Tis well! yet then inform me, Sir,How you'll employ th' invaluable hoursThat still precede the truce?SIR ALEXANDER.Our gallant menHave been severely tried, and worn with toil.ARCHIBALD.Their toil-enfeebled bodies still encloseThe mounting spirit of unwearied vigor.VALENTINE.Prompt as the hawk to dart upon his prey.ARCHIBALD.The foe since yesterday appears to have lostHalf of his wonted intrepidity.VALENTINE.That show'r of arrows we pour'd down at eveHath somewhat quench'd their ardor!SIR ALEXANDER.Be it so;But tell me what is now your present purpose:Methinks that swelling to some bold designYour bosom labours.—Speak, my Valentine.VALENTINE.Command my elder brother, Sir, to speak.SIR ALEXANDER.Unfold then, Archibald, this mysterious something,This painful secret that disturbs you both.ARCHIBALD.Last night, as we reclin'd upon our couch,Still talking o'er (as is our wonted manner)The various hazard of the busy day,We wish'd, we fondly wish'd, that ere the truceShould intervene, some daring enterprizeMight be attempted under our direction:Thus we convers'd in sacred confidenceTill as our weak'ning voices died awayWe wearied into rest—'twas then an image—VALENTINE.Mark, Sir, what now my brother will unfold.ARCHIBALD.'Twas then an image rush'd upon my sight,It shew'd as one of the angelic train,A circling glory glitter'd o'er his head,A smile benignant beautified his lip,And thus he spoke—'Sons of the valiant Seaton,Arise and hasten to the southern gate,Thence dart upon the foe.'—The vision ceas'dAnd vanish'd into air! while a rude noiseLike the fierce struggle of contending spearsSuddenly waked us! Starting from my couch,And ere I cou'd communicate my dream,Valentine with impatient voice disclos'dThe mutual vision.VALENTINE.'Twas as he relates;By honor's winnow'd purity I swearThe nightly visitation also cameTo me.SIR ALEXANDER.I hazard no impeachment ofYour truth; yet then, endearing children, tell meHow can a prudent tender parent sendHis valiant sons to danger's precipiceAt the fantastic impulse of a dream?ARCHIBALD.In the old time we read that dreams have oftenBeen the prophetic leaders to success.VALENTINE.Oh do not, Sir, with caution's chill restraintO'ershade the splendid purpose of our soul.ARCHIBALD.Let the bright vision be forgot, if thatOffend you, and attend to reason's voice:Does not the weary foe anticipateTh' approaching truce, and guard neglectinglyThe southern gate?SIR ALEXANDER.'Tis a mask'd neglect,It is the couchant lion prompt to seizeTh' unwary prey—ah! trust not to his sternRepose.VALENTINE.If danger still must check the currentOf enterprize, tell, tell me, Father, whereforeYou rear'd us in the hardy school of war?ARCHIBALD.The road to martial glory well thou know'stIs not gay-sprinkled o'er with flowers, but brokenHelmets, shiver'd spears, and blood-stain'd arrowsChoak up th' aspiring path of fame's ascent.VALENTINE.To be restrain'd when proud occasion calls,'Twere better thou hadst led me to some cloister,Where holy peace resides, o'er-canopiedBy antient roofs, that ever shade her fromThe madd'ning sun-beams of ambition's sky.SIR ALEXANDER.Forbear to torture thus a parent's feelings.ARCHIBALD.Indulgent Father, rest assur'd we bothPay homage to the thought that now disturbs you;But with th' experienced Melvil we have justConferr'd.SIR ALEXANDER.And he undoubtedly contemn'dYour gaudy dream, that meteor of the brain.VALENTINE.'Twas not the meteor of a heated brain,It was a sunbeam of revealing Heaven,It was the sympathetic glow of twoAccording minds.SIR ALEXANDER.Of this enough—What saidTh' experienc'd Melvil?ARCHIBALD.After due attentionTo our proposal, he first stamp'd it withThe seal of his applause, and then addedArguments that embodied as it wereOur enterprize, and brighten'd it with theCalm colouring of reason.SIR ALEXANDER.I will myselfConfer with Melvil; and if he has wordsTo smooth the rugged doubts that vex my mind,Think not, my valiant sons, I shall withholdYou from the object of your bold requestARCHIBALD.To keep unsullied the bright martial nameOf Seaton, is indeed my proudest wish.VALENTINE.And if thy Valentine might add his miteTo the rich treasury of his Father's fame,He would be happy.SIR ALEXANDER.Wait till I return.Exit.ARCHIBALD.Excellent man! his ardour to promoteOur cause, and his solicitude aboutOur safety, combat and distract his will.VALENTINE.More active, warm, and forcible affectionWas ne'er embosom'd in a father's soul;And therefore much I fear that Melvil can'tSubdue his scruples.ARCHIBALD.Oft have I observ'dThat Melvil's clear illumin'd manly judgmentPossesses something like magnetic power,Which still attracts opinion to his side.VALENTINE.May that attractive power be at this momentEndued with double influence, that my FatherWithholding his restraint, I might unboundedSpring against the foe!—This common praiseThat's claim'd by every soldier, ill suppliesMy starv'd and craving appetite of fame.ARCHIBALD.Endearing Valentine, think not that IReprove these flashes of an ardent mind;But should your mounting wishes meet controul,Wound not a Father's tender caution withReproach.VALENTINE.Sooner than wound his feeling mindWith sullen, splenetic, unduteous carriage,I wou'd, like the Spartan boy (who silentlyEndur'd the gnawing fox) conceal my sorrow,Though, like the savage animal, it shouldPrey upon my vitals.ARCHIBALD.Consider alsoThis warlike age will gratify your wishesWith many a future enterprize! The mornOf life is now but breaking on thy youth.VALENTINE.Talk not to me of early youth: beholdEdward's brave son, whose age but equals mine—Oh were I equal with him in renown!Behold that boy on Cressy's wond'ring fieldReaping an immortal harvest, while IEnveloped in obscurity—ARCHIBALD.Desist,I hear some step approaching.
Enter DONALDSON.VALENTINE.'Tis my Father;Ah, no! 'tis Donaldson. Say, hast thou seenThe Governor?DONALDSON.I saw him as I pass'd byIn close conference engag'd with Melvil.VALENTINE.Know'st thou the subject of their conference?DONALDSON.There breathes an ignorant rumour of a sally,Propos seems by Archibald and you.ARCHIBALD.It is as you have darkly heard, and hereImpatiently we wait the Governor'sReturn.VALENTINE.See, here he comes.Enter Sir ALEXANDER.Hail to my Father!ARCHIBALD.Sir, you appear disturbed.SIR ALEXANDER.Ah! tell me, Archibald,Is't with a look of cheerfulness a parentResigns his duteous children to the hazardOf a fearful enterprize?ARCHIBALD.Yet then reflect,Melvil the military sage approvesThe enterprize.SIR ALEXANDER.But Melvil has no children,His smooth sail of honour meets no adverseGales to check its progress.—'Tis not thus with me:Say how shall I endure the keen reproofsOf Ethelberta, when she is inform'dThat I have sent, without the imperious callOf stern necessity, her darling childrenTo the path of danger?VALENTINE.Speak not of danger,'Tis the soldier's charter, his best privilege.SIR ALEXANDER.Something withholds my full consent.And calls my judgment to severe account!Forgive this trembling caution in a parent.VALENTINE.Had England's warlike king suppress'd his son'sAscending soul, on her proud list of victoriesWe should not have found the name of Cressy!ARCHIBALD.'Twas on the summit of a neighb'ring hillThe father stood, and saw his youthful sonOppose the pride of France; and when the EarlsOf Warwick and of Oxford sent a herald,To claim immediate succour from the king—VALENTINE.Did not the king reply, Go tell the lordsWho sent you, that while my boy 's aliveThey will require my aid in vain: the gloryOf this great day shall be his own?SIR ALEXANDER.Enough!Your arguments prevail, and you have won meTo your request.—Go, join the skilful Melvil,The Nestor of the war, and strictly markHis words and well-weigh'd counsel—first receiveThe anxious Father's blessing.
(Embraces his sons.)May that PowerWho oft hath shielded me in many a combat,Oh! may that guardian, kind, benignant AngelNow hover o'er my children!(Leads them to the door, and returns.)Donaldson,This is an awful moment for a Father!DONALDSON.Think not so deeply, Sir, nor feed your mindWith busy tort'ring vain surmises; thinkHow often you've encounter'd perils imminent,And still return'd with glory.SIR ALEXANDER.UnavailingRemembrance! rear'd as I have almost beenIn storms of battle, say what paternalBosom will not feel a warm renew'd affectionFor two such sons staged to the front of danger?DONALDSON.But should not Ethelberta be informed?SIR ALEXANDER.Ah! there you probe my bosom's tender part:No, Donaldson, the mother must not knowThe gathering storm that's brooding o'er her sons;Her quick'ning apprehension would outrunThe deed, and picture to itself imagesThat would distract her.—'Tis my duty, myReligion, still to shield her mind from allThat may assail it.DONALDSON.Many a time haveI listen'd to the splendid narrativeOf Ethelberta's virtues.SIR ALEXANDER.From the happy hourI first call'd her mine, unto this moment,She has with unremitting fortitudeAttended me through many a rugged day.DONALDSON.I think that England triumphs in her birth.SIR ALEXANDER.At those fam'd tournaments that Edward heldAt Windsor, did I first behold that matchlessWoman, tho' attractive, yet not dazzling:As looks the softer green amidst the radiantColours of the vernal bow, so EthelbertaSeem'd 'mid the circling flush of British beauties.—This gorgeous castle, and its proud delights,The daughter of Earl Nevil willinglyResign'd, to share with me the perils ofThe late crusade: This faithful Wife, this soothingCompanion of my way, still smooth'd the harrow'dWalk of war—Ev'n as the wall-flower rears its form,And smiles and flourishes 'midst tombs and ruins,So Ethelberta's warm affection grew'Mid sickness, want, fatigue, distress, and danger.Enter ANSELM.Hail, holy father! what dost thou report?ANSELM.With hasty step I come, Sir, to acquaint youThat the bold enterprize is well prepar'd:Along the subterraneous windings didThe gallant troops advance, 'till they approach'dThe chapel of St. Andrew, near the gateThat issues to the field: here paus'd the band—And then in sacred silence lowly bendingDedicated themselves unto their country.SIR ALEXANDER.What follow'd?ANSELM.Then with solemn voice I utter'dWarm from my throbbing heart, the benedictionThat is appointed in the hour of danger.SIR ALEXANDER.Yet tell me what directions then were given?ANSELM.It was agreed that your two sons, attendedBy a chosen few, should rush upon the foe,While Melvil with a greater number should,Taking a wide circling path, fall on the rear.Brave Melvil first began the silent march:Then did your sons lead forth their gallant menThro' the deep awful gloom—the signal forThe onset is to be the convent bellThat tolls at midnight.SIR ALEXANDER.Wherefore did I yield meTo their wild request? Oh say, is 't yet too late?The leave they wrested from me I may stillRecall.ANSELM.The die is cast, and you must waitTh' event: yet elevate your mind to hope;For me I augur well of this bold enterprize.SIR ALEXANDER.But as a Father shou'd I not have beenMore cautious, more reserved?ANSELM.The sacred poetSays, Children are as arrows in the handOf a giant, to perform his purpose.SIR ALEXANDER.Your words, good Anselm, animate my hopes,And lift me to my wonted confidenceIn Heaven.—Did'st thou not say, the convent bellAt midnight was th' appointed signal forThe onset?ANSELM.Ev'n so!SIR ALEXANDER.See Ethelberta comes;Farewell—'tis meet that now ye both retire.Exeunt.Enter ETHELBERTA.ETHELBERTA.I hope I'm no intruder; if I am,My warm solicitude for you must pleadIndulgence.SIR ALEXANDEREver most welcome!ETHELBERTA.MethinksYou look all harass'd, pale and overcome;Tis not surprising—but I'm told the foeAnticipates the truce, by retreatingTo some distance.—Wherefore do you notRetire to rest? 'Tis late, 'tis almost midnight.SIR ALEXANDER.Midnight, did'st thou say?ETHELBERTA.Sir, you seem alarm'd?SIR ALEXANDER.What recent subject is there to alarm me?ETHELBERTA.Forgive my busy fond anxiety,That catches as it were at airy symptoms.—Where are my sons? tell me when I may see them?SIR ALEXANDER.I hope to-morrow.ETHELBERTA.Wherefore dost thou onlyHope? Does not the truce take place to-morrow?What should then prevent?—(The bell tolls.)Oh! what transports you?'Twas but the wonted midnight bell, that callsThe holy fathers to their pray'rs; relieve,Relieve me from this painful ignorance,And let thine Ethelberta share the pangThat rends thy heart.SIR ALEXANDER.Dear Wife, forbear to question me—ETHELBERTA.Will you not retire to rest, for sure youNeed it much?SIR ALEXANDER.Perchance I may.—DirectionsOf highest import I have first to give!ETHELBERTA.Farewell—do not tarry long.—Care and sorrowMingle on thy brow.—Farewell!—my warmestBlessing to my sons!—Exit.SIR ALEXANDER.That blessing was pronounc'dBy her whose sons perchance are now no more—Enter DONALDSON.Well Donaldson, what hast thou to relate?DONALDSON.By some perfidious means the foe, appris'dOf the intended sally, were prepar'd to meetThe troops that Melvil led.—O'erpower'd by numbers,He and most of his brave train lie slaughter'dOn the plain—As for your sons—SIR ALEXANDER.Ah! what of them?DONALDSON.In warmest combat they are now engag'd!SIR ALEXANDER.I'll fly to their assistance—(Draws his sabre.)DONALDSON.Let me first—SIR ALEXANDER.Cease your vain talking, I must speed awayTo save my sons, or perish in their cause.Exeunt.End of the FIRST ACT.ACT THE SECOND.Enter ETHELBERTA and JULIANA.ETHELBERTA.SAY, what can be the cause of their deserting me?I have not since the truce began beheldThe Governor, nor have I yet embrac'dMy children! they whose dutiful affectionI have until this present hour experienc'd!Whence comes it they defraud me of their cheeringPresence?JULIANA.'Tis business of some great momentPerchance delays them.ETHELBERTA.Feed me not with vainPretexts; their presence only can assuageMy starv'd and ravenous longing! wild conceptionPeoples the void of absence with manyGhastly and terrific forms.JULIANA.Shall I withdrawIn order to investigate the cause?ETHELBERTA.No, Juliana, you must not desert me,I am too wretched and unfit for solitude!Why do you send your view to yonder portal.(Juliana retires a few steps, and then returns.)JULIANA.Now cast away your fears; behold, behold!The Governor approaches.Enter SIR ALEXANDER.ETHELBERTA.Your presenceIs as the sun unto the darken'd landscape:Wherefore hast thou linger'd thus? Oh, tell meWhere are my children?SIR ALEXANDER.They are well.ETHELBERTA.Yet whyDo they delay to bless a mother's sight?SIR ALEXANDER.'Tis proper now I should reveal.ETHELBERTA.Reveal!You've then some fearful secret to unfold.SIR ALEXANDER.Dear Ethelberta, be not thus alarm'd!Already have I said our boys are well.Last night a sally was propos'd. ArchibaldAnd Valentine entreated much to leadThe onset.ETHELBERTA.And you yielded to their entreaty?SIR ALEXANDER.The subtle foe by some dark perfidyHad early notice of the deep-laid scheme,And were too well prepar'd.ETHELBERTA.My blood runs cold.SIR ALEXANDER.Ah, rather let it glow at my recital:Your sons have gain'd the warrior's best reward,Unsullied fame. Three times did their small forceDrive back their triple-number'd foes; at length,By their encreasing powers subdued (with nineOf their brave men remaining) they submittedTo be captives.ETHELBERTA.Say, who first suggestedThis rash enterprize?SIR ALEXANDER.Melvil applaudedWhat my sons propos'd; and to the energyWith which he utter'd his approving thoughtDid I reluctantly give my assent.ETHELBERTA.Curs'd be old Melvil for his rash approval!SIR ALEXANDER.Spare your resentment, and revere the dead;Fall'n is his valiant arm, to rise no more.ETHELBERTA.Then peace be to his soul! Let me retainA grateful sense to Heav'n that my lov'd childrenAre not, as Melvil, number'd with the slain;The loss of those dear boys would be to meAs if the spring were blotted from the year.Come, Juliana, let us to our customedVisitation of the sick and wounded.Exit Ethelberta and Juliana.Enter ANSELM.ANSELM.A herald from the foe is just arriv'd,And waits your orders for admission.SIR ALEXANDER.Let him be admitted.Enter HERALD.THE HERALD.Sir, this letter,Of high import, I'm order'd to deliverInto your hands only.SIR ALEXANDER.Retire awhile:In some few moments come for my reply.(Reads to himself.)ANSELM.Methinks you look disturb'd! Say, what can beThe drift of this important note?SIR ALEXANDER.Attend!
(reads aloud.)"Complaints have reach'd me from my court, as if"I linger'd in subjecting your proud town:"To these complaints strong menaces are added!"I therefore summon you to surrender,"Or else your sons shall rue your stubbornness:"I will erect two pillars near the tower"From whence your crowding arrows gall us most;"To these two pillars shall your sons be chain'd;"Expos'd to the whole tempest of the war."ANSELM.The blackest fiend in hell conceiv'd that thought,And breath'd it on his mind.SIR ALEXANDER.I know him well;It suits the native disposition of the man.Enter ETHELBERTA.ETHELBERTA.Ah! wonder not I hastily return:I'm told a Herald from the camp is come—What tidings of my sons?SIR ALEXANDER.Peruse this note.(She reads.)ETHELBERTA.Say, what dost thou intend to do?SIR ALEXANDER.My duty.ETHELBERTA.Is 't then a duty to destroy your children?To rend affection from your inmost breast;Uproot the thoughts of pity as they grow;Embowel nature of her hallow'd feelings?And to a mother dare you this avow?SIR ALEXANDER.I dare avow what honour bids me do.ETHELBERTA.The untam'd Arab, who exists on plunder,Lets fall his booty to assist his child!But you, whom polish'd manners should adorn,Whose pure religion wears a softer feature,Do you reject the impulse of compassion,For the stern morals of imagin'd honour?Enter HERALD.HERALD.Sir, the time urges, what is your reply?SIR ALEXANDER.Go, tell your savage, and blood-thirsty General,The sacred oath I utter'd to my countryAnd to my royal master, when I wasExalted to the station I now hold,Contains my answer.—Sir, you may return.ETHELBERTA.Stay one short moment, hear a mother plead:Tho' dead to pity, riches may perchanceAllure his mind! I've jewels of high value—(Sir Alexander makes a signal to the Herald, who retires.)He goes, he heeds not what I say; my sonsAre then condemn'd without resource. Enjoy,(turning to Sir Alexander.)Enjoy this philosophic victory,This conquest, this cold triumph o'er all feeling—Domestic pity, conjugal affiance,Fatherly endearment, are by you profan'd!SIR ALEXANDER.What does this mean? dare you assert I doNot love my children?ETHELBERTA.Say, where are the proofs?Is yielding up your sons without a conflict,Without resorting to the prompt expedientAffection wou'd have flown to? Is resigningYour sons, without the interposing a shortDelay, without a pause, without inventingSome pious artifice; are these the proofsOf your paternal kindness? EvidenceLike this would not be admitted in the courtOf Nature.SIR ALEXANDER.Cease this idle declamation!Respect, respect the great, the solemn trial,To which my pure allegiance now is call'd!I see the desolating hour approach,Like the dark storm that thickens as it sails!It is the woman's privilege to weepAnd utter her complaints: to man belongsThe majesty of grief! yet not the lessDoes the fond parent warm this bosom:Ev'n while proud honour and relentless dutySeem to command the function of my soul,I've that within that tells me I'm a father.ETHELBERTA.Thus the pale cheek of hungry fame is flush'dAnd rudded o'er with the false glow of duty.ANSELM.Make not the bitter cup he's doomed to drinkStill more bitter by the infusions of reproach.ETHELBERTA.May not the broken-hearted mother speak;May not her madd'ning sorrow still attemptTo snatch her children from destruction?Enter an OFFICER.OFFICER.I come to pour glad tidings on your ear!Your sons—ETHELBERTA.What of my sons?OFFICER.They are return'd:Relenting, as 'tis thought, of his intention,The General has restor'd them to your wishes.ETHELBERTA.Ah! tell me where you saw them?OFFICER.Ent'ring atThe southern gate, amidst th' applauding multitude!They bade me hasten to your presence withThe news of their return.ETHELBERTA.Wherefore do theyLinger thus?OFFICER.Methinks I hear their foot-steps—Enter ARCHIBALD and VALENTINE.ETHELBERTA.What glorious vision meets my raptur'd eyes!(Runs to embrace them.)This sudden joy, this unimagin'd heaven,Transports me beyond all pow'r of utterance.—SIR ALEXANDER.Your presence, my lov'd children, smoothsThe rugged conflict in my breast.—Whence comesThis change of counsel in the tyrant's mind?ETHELBERTA.Ah! rather tell me where, where is the joyThat ought to harmonise with ours? Archibald.Your down-cast look portends some dread intelligence:And you, my Valentine, where is thy wontedGaiety?ARCHIBALD.I have of high importanceSomething to communicate to my Father.ETHELBERTA.May not I be present at the interview?ARCHIBALD.What I'm going to unfold will distress you.ETHELBERTA.No, no! your mutual safety is sufficientTo bear me up against this new calamity!But wherefore do you weep?ARCHIBALD.These tears I shedSpring from affection, not from fear.—I'll dieWorthy of such parents.VALENTINE.So will I!ETHELBERTA.Wherefore,Wherefore do ye talk of death?ARCHIBALD.With a mockeryOf pity does the General send us back:One of us must return to be the victimOf his cruelty.ETHELBERTA.Oh! never.ARCHIBALD.We're boundBy honour's tie, the soldier's strongest chain;One must return: and unappall'd we wait(turning to Sir Alexander.)For your decision.SIR ALEXANDER.Ah! what Father canDecide of two affectionate and duteousChildren, which shall be led to slaughter? Say,Was I to raise in awful thought the balanceOf my affection, and cou'd judgment seeOne side prevail, still sacred nature's handWould join and equalize the trembling scales.VALENTINE(to ETHELBERTA.)Be comforted.ETHELBERTA.Oh! my dear Valentine.(Falls on his neck.)ANSELM.I think all this is a mere stratagemTo lengthen out the truce.—Allow me, Sir,To hasten to the General's tent; there willI urge with glowing words my suit,There paint the infamy that must involve him,If, thus profaning the hallow'd feelingsOf Parents—VALENTINE.Holy father! 'twou'd becomeThee better to assuage, support with comfort'sLenient voice, this drooping mother, than toInterfere with what regards my brother'sHonour and my own.ETHELBERTA.I'll write to the GeneralIn words of soothing power, in terms of energy,Such as the mother's throbbing heart conceives.VALENTINE.No letter must be written, for 'twou'd seemOur dictating, and would shew like cowardice.SIR ALEXANDER.There spoke my valiant son.ARCHIBALD.Our mutual dignityForbids, abhors all interposition.ETHELBERTA.Then I have lost my children.VALENTINF.That follows not;He who is first in years, in skill, experience,He must be spar'd, the general cause demands him.ARCHIBALD.What says the hasty Valentine?VALENTINE.CommandYour rising indignation, I'll explain.—Allow us, Father, for some few moments,To confer alone, that free from all restraintI may to Archibald disclose my mind,And utter arguments that may subdueHis reason to my ardent wish, and thusPrevent th' extinction of our family.ARCHIBALD.Perish to the root the name of Seaton,And let oblivion's night o'ershade the proudExploits of our long ancestry, ere IConsent to that which must degrade and shrinkMe in my own esteem!VALENTINE.I mean not that.SIR ALEXANDER.Come, Ethelberta, let us for a whileRetire, and leave them to confer alone.ETHELBERTA.Well the high theme of your discourse I know,It is a contest for the palm of death:But in this glorious conflict still rememberWhat is due to your afflicted Mother.If any plan, expedient, or device,Allied to honour, should suggest itself;If any beam should pierce this awful gloom,Admit its sacred influence on your mind,And save me from despair.(Exit with ANSELM, JULIANA, and SIR ALEXANDER.)VALENTINE.Fear is no inmate of thy glowing breast;Yet then reflect that other thoughts than thoseThat courage breathes must sometimes regulateA soldier's conduct. Say, hast thou not heardThat mercy, resignation, are the noblerDuties of a soldier?ARCHIBALD.Where is now thatMercy claim'd? where call'd for? mercy on whom?VALENTINE.Mercy on your Parents, and on your country.ARCHIBALD.This puerile declamation moves me not.VALENTINE.I speak the language of a mind sincere,To one who is my friend as well as brother,For whom my partial fondness ne'er was doubted.ARCHIBALD.He loves me not who does not love my fame!Was I to yield to your ill-tim'd suggestion,Wou'd not each finger mark me as I pass,As one who skulks behind the privilegeOf eldership to save himself from death?I feel dishonour as I feel a wound—The fatal spot to which we both aspire,Is glory's prize, is honour's awful station,And I now claim it as my sacred birth-right.VALENTINE.I contend no longer.ARCHIBALD.Let me hasten,Fly to my Father to proclaim the news,That Valentine at length consents to live.VALENTINE.Allow me one short moment, and be calm:Say, wilt thou, with an avarice of fame,Demand exclusively the meed of glory?Wilt thou pursue the path that leads to death,And leave thy faithful Valentine behind?ARCHIBALD.Cease, generous brother, or thou 'lt break my heart—VALENTINE.When first I quitted childhood's lowly vale,Eager with you I climb'd youth's arduous height,Whence greater scenes expanded on-my view;Still our pursuits, consenting to one plan,Our lives like wedded streams united roll'd;And will you now disturb the sacred tide,And bid the kindred waves disparting run?ARCHIBALD.'Tis as you say, in us was ever foundThe sympathetic union of the mind,The harmony of affection and design.VALENTINE.And wou'd it not be sacrilege to tearOur souls asunder?—Mark my firm resolve,I will attend thee to the fatal spot,And share an equal destiny with thee.ARCHIBALD.I yield, I bow to thy sublimer mind.VALENTINE.Let's haste away, lest Ethelberta shou'dReturn, and with her tears unman our purpose.ARCHIBALD.Agreed—We'll hasten to our mutual doom,Co-equals at the hallow'd shrine of danger.VALENTINE.Will not the spirits of our valiant ancestryLean from their golden thrones on high, well pleas'dWhile thus(Encircling his brother.)we march undaunted to our fate.One heart—ARCHIBALD.One cause—VALENTINE.One ruin, and one fame!Exeunt.End of the SECOND ACT.ACT THE THIRD.Enter ETHELBERTA and JULIANA.ETHELBERTA.FLED to the camp! Both fled! Impossible!JULIANA.Pure honour breathing on their bosom—ETHELBERTA.Fled,Without one parting word!JULIANA.The great trialThey are call'd to claims their whole attention.ETHELBERTA.Has then the phantom glory steel'd my childrenInto savages?—Not one endearingWord to soothe their fond afflicted Mother?JULIANA.The rigorous duty of their situation—ETHELBERTA.What duty is more pressing or more sacredThan that a Mother claims? It rises outOf Nature's bosom, summon'd by the voiceOf Heaven!JULIANA.Their better judgment held them fromYour presence; well, full well they knew the sightOf two sons hast'ning to untimely deathWou'd rend your heart.ETHELBERTA.It must be so, it was,It was their love that urg'd them to avoid me!The cloud of dark surmise that here was gatheringBegins to melt in air! and my full heartExpands to all its wonted warm affection.JULIANA.To this affection join a confidenceThat all may yet be well.ETHELBERTA.I dare not castA meeting glance upon th' approaching hour.—Cou'd I but raise my sinking mind to theFaint hope, that the arrows haply might notReach my children!—That the tyrant mayRelent of his fell purpose! Vain endeavour!—Each way I look I meet despair.—Yet now—A thought possesses me—Indulge my weakness—Ah! pity the disease that flies to suchA remedy—I've heard a skilful sorceressDoes in this town reside, whose magic powerUnfolds the future to her trembling visitant—JULIANA.It is as you report, and many a haplessVirgin, many a distressful mother,Have consulted her.ETHELBERTA.'Tis said she rivalsThe weird sisterhood of ancient days,While o'er her mind pale prophecy hangs fluttering,The dread vaunt-courier of futurity—Perchance this deeply-skill'd magician mayTransport my ignorant fears beyond th' event.JULIANA.Yet say, was she by her exploring artTo raise your ignorant fears to horrid certainties—ETHELBERTA.Better to know the worse, than thus to liveIn apprehension, unrelenting agony!—Can'st thou inform me where the sorceress dwells?JULIANA.Her lonely cell is seen not far from hence,Amidst the ruins of an ancient cloister,Upon the burial ground! There on a seatOf ebony, o'erspread with human skulls,She exerciseth her tremendous function.ETHELBERTA.Whence does the hag derive her daring mission?Is 't from on high, or from the caves of hell?Does she not lift her impious hand to rendThe sanctuary-veil that hangs 'tween men and angels?And on the breast of heaven she sends a glanceProfane!JULIANA.This deep reflection will avertYour anxious mind from its new-form'd purpose.ETHELBERTA.Let me be wretched, let me not be impious:Never will I tread the path that leads toHer unhallow'd cell.—Another thought occurs,Which meets my heart's consent—Come, come what may,I'll go in person to the hostile camp,There, rushing on the rude barbarian,I will demand my children.JULIANA.Vain, vain project!ETHELBERTA.He'll hear my plaintive voice, he'll see these eyesIn tears.JULIANA.Th' unfeeling wretch will mock those tears.ETHELBERTA.Affection will endue my speech with eloquence;The monster self will soften at warm naturePleading for her darling sons.JULIANA.ConsiderWhat dangers you'll encounter, to what insultsYou there may be expos'd: 'tis likely youMay be detain'd a captive, and immur'dWithin the precincts of a lonesome dungeon.ETHELBERTA.Talk not to me of dangers, I despise them.Say, hast thou not beheld the bold sea-eagle,When her dear young one from the rock hath fall'n,Descend undaunted to the roaring main,Dash with her throbbing breast the waves asunder,To snatch the nestling from the ravenous shark!And would'st thou have me pause and hesitateTo act the mother's part? Let us retire,And seek for Anselm to attendAnd guide my footsteps to the tyrant's tent.Exeunt.Enter Sir ALEXANDER and ANSELM.SIR ALEXANDER.Yes, Anselm, I confess I glory inThese children—their abrupt departure wakesAt once my wonder and delight! Say, hasIt not a relish of the antique manners,Some proud resemblance of the Roman mind?ANSELM.This mutual dedication of themselvesTo certain death will ornament our annals.SIR ALEXANDER.As torrents feed the river, so my sonsSwell the strong current of my country's fame.ANSELM.You also share your part in this sublimeTransaction.SIR ALEXANDER.The renown is their's, and mineIs the distress.—My scene in this deep dramaIs to bid my archers shoot their arrowsWhere my defenceless sons will be expos'dTo their full rage.—Alas! I fear, good father,I have not virtue equal to the task.ANSELM.Virtue is ever found superior toThe rugged task; and, like the water-plant,Ascends still higher than the swelling flood.SIR ALEXANDER.Was ever father so severely tried?ANSELM.Image to yourself that you are actingIn sight of angels and immortal spirits,And thro' the scenery that darkens roundLook up, as to the sun that breaks the cloud,Look up unto th' approving smile of Heav'n!SIR ALEXANDER.I sometimes think the tyrant will relent.ANSELM.He 's not of English birth.SIR ALEXANDER.Of that you may be certain:Humanity adorns the English soldier;It is the wholesome gale that ventilatesTheir heart, from the low subaltern up toThe royal youth who now in Gallia leadsHis valiant band—ANSELM.From Norway is he not,This wretch who outrages a parent's feelings?SIR ALEXANDER.Ev'n so.—A pirate on the northern seas,His skill and matchless courage lifted himTo fame: and being by distress of weatherDriv'n on the English coast, the warlike Edward,Dazzled by his enterprizing spirit,Gave him to command the troops that now invest us.ANSELM.But tell me, has your sons' abrupt departureYet reach'd the ear of hapless Ethelberta?SIR ALEXANDER.I know not that.—I must not now approachHer presence; her unbounded sorrow wouldIll suit the frame of mind that I must nowAcquire!—Go, holy father, and dispenseThe balm of comfort to her bleeding soul—I must confer with Donaldson.Exit ANSELM.Enter DONALDSON.DONALDSON.Your commands have been attended to, andNow the town is disencumber'd of itsNumbers—The wide northern gate recoiling,Pour'd forth a length'ning train.—The aged warriorsPass'd on in mournful silence.—This dismission,Which mark'd their inutility, appear'dTo humble and degrade them.SIR ALEXANDER.'Tis a cruelBut necessary order on my part—Yet then these aged and once active menMay haply in a few short days return,And then resume their wonted occupations,Habits and customs, which they now forego—But never shall I meet with comfort more—My sons! my sons!DONALDSON.Next in long order mov'dA female band, while many a pensive wifeThrew back a frequent glance of fond regard.SIR ALEXANDER.'Tis well.—Your diligence demands my thanks,The truce will in two hours expire.—I mustPrepare me for the sad, the solemn taskImperious duty has impos'd upon me.—'Tis time the men ascend th' embattled walls,In act to hurl the arrowy war below.DONALDSON.I left the men assembling in the square.SIR ALEXANDER.Oh! wou'd that, with the safety of this town,Which to my latest moment I'll defend,I might include the safety of my children.Exit.SCENE, the Enemy's Camp.Enter ETHELBERTA and ANSELM.SENTINEL to ETHELBERTA.Arrest your daring footsteps!ETHELBERTA.Your upliftedWeapon frights not her, to whose misfortunesDeath were welcome.—I am Ethelberta.(The Sentinel returns the sabre into the scabbard.)Haply in some far distant hamlet sitsYour mother brooding o'er your absence, allIn tears: Oh! think of her, and lead me toMy sons.SENTINEL.Beneath you tent the captive youthsAbide.ETHELBERTA.Inform your General, that the wretchedEthelberta humbly begs an audience.Exit Sentinel.(As ETHELBERTA and ANSELM approach the tent ARCHIBALD and VALENTINE rush out.)ETHELBERTA.Marvel not at my appearance, my bleedingBosom demanded this sad interview.ARCHIBALD.We're ever bound to you for this new proofOf your affection.VALENTINE.Have you seen the General?ETHELBERTA.I've ask'd a conference—I wait the answer.VALENTINE.Be sure you let him know that we did notUrge or prompt you to demand an audience.ETHELBERTA.Is it then criminal in me to ownA Mother's feelings?ARCHIBALD.It is beneath the dignityOf Ethelberta to confer with him.ETHELBERTA.Say, what dignity belongs to a wretchLike me?VALENTINE.His ear is steel'd against compassion,Nor do we wish to live.ETHELBERTA.Why, Valentine,This contempt of life? would you not live toSave me from distraction?—Is the crueltyThat breathes within the General's tentContagious? are my children grown insensibleTo their afflicted mother?VALENTINE(Embracing her knees.)Think not soUnjustly of us.ETHELBERTA.Oh! I think you bothLove me, or I shou'd wish to be the dustBeneath your feet.Enter an OFFICER.OFFICER.The General now in councilWaits your attendance.Exeunt ETHELBERTA, ANSELM, and OFFICER.VALENTINE.Sooner would the sea-cliffStoop to the sinking mariner, than willThe tyrant bend to her imploring voice;I mean his mercy will not reach us both.What if Ethelberta shou'd return, andBring with her commands for your releasement?ARCHIBALD.I wou'd reject the despicable mercy.Has not our mutual vow to Heav'n ascended?Yes, brother, both must be releas'd, or bothConsign'd to death!Enter OFFICER.OFFICER.The General bids me leadYou to the fatal spot, with orders thatYou should immediately be fasten'd toThe summit of the pillars.ARCHIBALD and VALENTINE.We obey.Exeunt.SCENE.—The place where pillars are erected; men with ropes, &c.FIRST MAN.I relish not this barb'rous employment;It pains me to behold these ligaments,With which we soon must bind the valiant youths.SECOND MAN.'Tis said the Mother now is with the General,Imploring for her sons.FIRST MAN.I fear in vain!Behold, they now approach.Enter ARCHIBALD, VALENTINE, OFFICER and SOLDIERS.With great reluctanceDo I perform this office.ARCHIBALD.My good friend,Discharge your duty: leave the rest to Heaven!ETHELBERTA, behind the scenes.Lead, lead me to those dear unfortunate sons.Enter ETHELBERTA and ANSELM.ETHELBERTA.Inhuman wretches! check your dreadful office,This sight appals me.ARCHIBALD.Still, oh still be comforted!We suffer more for your sake than our own.ETHELBERTA.Was it for this I rear'd you with such care?Was it for this I watch'd your waking virtues,And kindled at the dawn of your celestial mind?VALENTINE.We were born to die.ETHELBERTA.Had gradual illnessStol'n on you as ye faded in my arms,Or had ye fall'n in battle, then I shou'd,Like many, many more unfortunate mothers,Have mournfully submitted; but this outrage,This indignity—VALENTINE.Affects me not, I amProud to fall in such a cause.ETHELBERTA,to ANSELM.Did I notFall at the tyrant's feet; did I not batheThem with my tears? Like the unheeding rockHe stood unmov'd. The stranger Pity knew notThe dark avenue to his heart.ANSELM.The king of terrors,Death, comes like a friendly angelIn a noble cause.ARCHIBALD.'Tis as the holyFather says. The cause for which we die brightensThe darken'd hour: it is the cause that dignifiesThose ignominious instruments; that turnsThese fatal pillars into pyramidsProclaiming our eternal fame.ETHELBERTA.Who wouldNot glory in such children? Yes, ye areMy boast, my honour, my delight. I first ledYour infant footsteps to the path of virtue:Indulge the fond idea, haply thisSublime enthusiasm flows from me.VALENTINE.Speak ever thus, and be the HeroineOf this conflicting hour.ARCHIBALD.Methought! as thusYou spoke, a current of new ardour gush'dUpon my throbbing heart.ETHELBERTA.Be not deceiv'd,The momentary gleam of triumph's past;To glory's touch succeeds tormenting fear,And Nature gives me up to grief again.Enter OFFICER.OFFICER.The General bids me urge you to retire.ETHELBERTA.Does he prohibit this short interview?This last dear horror of a sad farewell?(Leans overpower'd upon ANSELM.)OFFICER.The General also says, that one of theseYouths may return, and that the choice remainsWith you.ETHELBERTA.(suddenly raising up her head.)Ah! were I to absolve the lifeOf one, say by that act should I not condemnThe other to the fate that threatens him?OFFICER.Reflect, that by these means you will preventTh' entire extinction of your name.ETHELBERTA.Your reasoningTouches not a mother's breast.—While I beholdMy sons as now they stand before me, andRecal their virtues, their invariableAffection tow'rds their mother, and the concordOf their congenial minds, the interweavingHarmony of colouring, that composesThe texture of their mutual life, my heartBlends, and unites the two, and my fond eyesBehold but one dear son!(ARCHIBALD and VALENTINE throw themselves at her feet, while ETHELBERTA hangs over them.)ARCHIBALD(rising.)Kind, pitying father,We intrust her to your care: Oh comfort her!ANSELM.Mark this hallow'd symbol of our dread belief:(Holding up the cross that hangs at his side.)By this I swear I will administerTo her relief, and wait upon her sorrow,And shed upon the fest'ring wound of griefThat Gilead balm, Religion only canSupply: from thence alone can comfort flow.ETHELBERTA.Who talks of comfort? Say, will not these pillarsRise to my mind in every place, to frightenComfort from me? In such a state, comfortWou'd be impiety, leave, leave me withDespair. Oh! would to Heav'n that in this conflictOf life and sorrow, sorrow might prevail,That I might fall death-smitten on this spot,And in one grave be buried with my sons!OFFICER.The time expires, the truce will shortly end,The war will be renew'd, and from you townThe arrows then will fly.ETHELBERTA.To pierce my children—Tort'ring madness harbours in the thought.OFFICER.That devious path-way leads not to the town.ETHELBERTA.Forgive, I was a moment scarce myself,And still a dimness hangs across my sight.Where are my sons?(they go up to her.)Forbear, forbear to weep,I see my presence but enfeebles them:Tis cruelty to linger, then resolv'dI tear myself away.

Ere now your sons are bound to theLofty pillars with their bosoms bare, to catchThe arrows which these men are now in actTo shoot, and only wait your terribleCommand.SIR ALEXANDER.Ah! leave me then to my dread duty,Retire, Retire!—The truce is just expiring,The trembling sands have almostRun their hour.ETHELBERTA,kneeling.See at your feet the Mother of your children,Who thro' th' unvaried course of long attachmentHas shewn she's not unworthy of your choice.Oh! how I glory'd in that day, when firstYou call'd me yours! and do I live to curseThat day?SIR ALEXANDER.Rise, Ethelberta, cease entreating—Awake each virtue that surrounds your heart!Elevate your mind, and dare to meet theApproaching trial; think that now you standAs in a solemn temple, and forbearWith vain complaining accents to disturbThe awful service that is now beginning.ETHELBERTA.These proud exalted sentiments suit wellThe breast that's fed with glory's turgid vapour:My simple heart feels nothing but affection.SIR ALEXANDER.Would'st have me be a traitor do my country?ETHELBERTA.Dar'st thou assume the sacred name of Father,And can'st thou unappall'd behold that scene?SIR ALEXANDER.The voice that dares dissuade me from my dutyIs to my careless ear an empty sound.Mark me, Ethelberta!

Oh! say, by what bless'd meansAm I become the happiest of mothers?VALENTINE.As the enemy retreated from the walls,Orders were issued (shou'd we be alive)To drag us back again in chains as captives;But our bold troops, with hasty step advancing,By the resistless effort of DonaldsonWe are restor'd to safety and to you.ETHELBERTAto DONALDSON.Take, take a mother's thanks: this gallant deedOf thine, brave youth, yes, it is here engrav'dDeep in the last recesses of my heart.SIR ALEXANDER.Thanks to my sons, my matchless sons, who onThis memorable day have pour'd fresh lustreOn our name and on our country.

AND SPOKEN BY MRS. POPE.AS now I come unarm'd, without a dart,I fear I can't presume to touch your heart;But your indulgence, here so often sound,Has on my heart, at least, imprest a wound;A sacred wound! which I am proud to feel,Which, if I know myself, will never heal.Methinks I hear you say, Dear Mrs. POPE,Amidst what mould'ring Annals did you grope,And dig, from out the mine of tragic ore,A tale unfashion'd from the days of yore—Where two wild Boys take such prodigious pains,And are determin'd to be hung in chains?Goes your complaint to this?—that we displayA tale unsuited to the modern day?Does this fam'd Island then produce no moreThe bright atchievements of the days of yore?Avert the thought!—still ancient Glory tow'rs,And warm heroic Virtue still is ours!Ev'n here, as I the martial theme pursue,Full many a mother rises to my view,Whose ardent Sons domestic comforts fly,To seek th' advancing Foe with kindling eye,And, braving the full force of hostile pow'r,Add to their Country's wreath another flow'r.No station, titles, here exemption claim;All feel alike tbe sympathetic lme:E'en SHE whose life adds splendour to a Throne,Whom ev'ry British heart delights to own—E'en SHE beholds her brave undaunted SON,In early youth the path of danger run!Happy the realm, in this convulsive Age,Whose tragic scenes are only on the Stage!Calamity extends her wither'd hand,And drags her harrow o'er a neighb'ring Land;While you, reclin'd beneath a softer sway,Bask and enjoy a bright unclouded day.Depress'd by civic storms, deform'd with woes,Stung by the pangs of agonizing throes,A Nation falls.—'Tis yours to still the storm,To raise with gen'rous arm her bleeding form,To soothe her shame, administer relief,To close the gushing artery of grief,To cast a veil o'er each disgraceful seam,And once more lift her to her own esteem.This Godlike act, which is reserv'd for you,With glowing zeal and confidence pursue:This act from future times shall homage claim,Extend your worth, and consecrate your fame!
