BOOK THE FIRST.CELESTIAL Maid! from genuine Science sprung!Thee the pretended Sage, whose leaden eyeInwrapt in metaphysic gloom, ne'er deignsA cheerful smile, thee with contracted brow,And haughty gesture, all his vassals shun:While by the Graces drest Instruction ownsThy guiding hand. Celestial maid attend!Tho barren be the subject, o'er its' wildsSo may a verdure not their own be shed,And blooming flowers. With me then turn thy sightOn the prime Infant-state of helpless Man:On the first dawn of life, when Nature nowUshers her tender offspring into day;Observe the young ideas how they wakeIn gradual order, till at length maturedBy time, they speak a living soul within.
View too the transient flash of mirth; the illsNot real, yet afflictive; the quick thoughtFor ever varying, glanced from toy to toy.Then constant motion pleases, then the earCatches at every sound, the eye untiredDarts its wild ray, and every object thrillsThe new-born sense with joy. Come Virgin, teachHow on the government of these first yearsDepends the future Man; no vulgar theme,No fruitless task, experiencing thy aid.WE write to reason: Hence ye doating trainOf Midwives and of Nurses ignorant!Old Beldames grey, in error positive,And stiff in prejudice, whose fatal careOft death attends, or a life worse than death.O YOUTH, whoe'er thou art, to beauty's charmsA slave, to all that inexpressive graceWhich native modesty and truth bestowsOn their more beauteous minds, and which exalts
Britannia's Daughters o'er the female world!Is thy Beloved propitious? Doth the godKindle his nuptial torch? And dost thou wishThe name of Father, amiable, humane?To view thy little Progeny aroundHappy, well-formed, and strong? Attend the Muse:Th' instructive Muse shall teach thee to obtainThy heart's desire. And say, wilt thou fair Nymph,Complacent heed with favourable eyeThe moral lay, refined and pure? To theeCustom hath given, while active life shall callThy Husband forth amid its boist'rous walks,Domestic rule: Thine is the nursery's charge;Important trust! from him what absence hides,Thy constant anxious care shall well supply.HEALTH is the greatest blessing Man receivesFrom bounteous Heaven; by her the smiling hoursAre wing'd with transport; she too gives the soulOf firmness; without her the hand of toilWould languid sink; the eye of reason fade.
To this then bend thy care, O Parent Mind;Array thy Child in health; a nobler dressNot gorgeous Majesty can boast; the thanksOf future gratitude thou wilt receive,More than around him from thy treasured hoardThen showering sums profuse; or giving allThy herds, and bleating flocks; tho thousands rangeThy spacious meads, or cloath thy ample hills.WOULD'ST thou thy children blest? The sacred voiceOf Nature calls thee; where she points the wayTread confident. No labyrinth is here;No clue of Ariadne wilt thou need,To Theseus given; Fair is her open path,And strong the steady light she casts around,Instinctive light, the surest safest guide.THY Child is born. See, where the treacherous nurse,Or Priestess of Lucina, in her handThe ready medicine brings! Forewarned, beware;Within the fatal drug lurks death; by this
Thousands from yet untasted life retire,Thousands of infant souls; yet sanctifiedBy custom, other reasons are assign'dAnd Nature is accused of impious deedsShe ne'er committed. Nature will preserveWhate'er she frames: and what the Child requiresIn his new state, sagaciously provides,Both food and remedy: Before the sunHath from his birth encircled half the sphere,He asks, plain as expressive signs can ask,The Mother's breast: Without a moment's pauseHear the mute voice of instinct and obey.Know the first efflux from the milky fountIs Nature's chymic mixture, which no powerOf Art presumptuous can supply; this flowsGently detersive, purifying, bland;This each impediment o'ercomes, and givesThe young, unfetter'd springs of life to play.Hence too the Mother is secure: The streamsHer Infant's health promoting, flow to herSalubrious; otherwise confined, or urged
Back to their source, what evils may she dread!Sickness, and giddy languor, shivering cold,And heat alternate, dire obstructions, pangsOf sharpest torture, cancers, by the juiceOf boasted hemlock not to be removed.O MOTHER, (let me by that tenderest nameConjure thee) still pursue the task begun;Nor unless urged by strong necessity,Some fated, some peculiar circumstance,By which thy health may suffer, or thy childSuck in disease, or that the genial foodToo scanty flows, give to an Alien's careThy orphan Babe. Oh! if by choice thou dost—What shall I call thee? Woman? No, tho fairThy face, and deckt with unimagined charms,Tho sweetness seem pourtray'd in every line,And smiles which might become a Hebe, riseAt will, crisping thy rosy cheeks, tho allThat's lovely, kind, attractive, elegant,Dwell in thy outward shape, and catch the eye
Of gazing rapture, all is but deceit;The form of Woman's thine, but not the soul.Had'st thou been treated thus, perchance the preyOf death long since, no child of thine had knownAn equal lot severe. O unblown Flower!Soft bud of Spring! Planted in foreign soilHow wilt thou prosper! Brush'd by other windsIn a new clime, and fed by other dewsThan suit thy Nature! From a stranger handAh, what can Infancy expect, when sheWhose essence was inwove with thine, whose life,Whose soul thou didst participate, neglectsHerself in thee, and breaks the strongest sealWhich Nature stamp'd in vain upon her heart.O LUCKLESS Babe, born in an evil hour!Who shall thy numerous wants attend? exploreThe latent cause of ill? thy slumbers guard?And when awake, with nice sedulityThy every glance observe? A parent might;A Hireling cannot; tho of blameless mind,
Tho conscious duty prompt her to the task,She feels not in her breast th' impulsive goadOf instinct, all the fond, the fearful thoughtsAwakening: Say, at length that habit's powerCan something like maternal kindness give,Yet, ere that time, may the poor nursling die.BESIDES, who can assure the lacteal springsClear, and untained? Oft disorder lurksBeneath the vivid bloom, and cheerful eye,Promising health; and poisonous juice secrete,Slow undermining life, stains what should beThe purest nutriment. Hence, worse than death,Long years of misery to thy blasted child.A burthen to himself, by others shunn'd,He wishes for the grave, and wastes his daysIn solitary woe; or haply weds,And propagates th' hereditary plague;Entailing on his name the bitter curseOf generations yet unborn, a racePithless, and weak, of faded texture, wan;
Like some declining plant, with mildew'd leaves,Whose root a treacherous insect gnaws unseen.BUT, whether lost in pleasure, in the roundOf modish life, and dissipation gay,Misnamed polite, the welfare of her childThe fair Barbarian looks on with an eyeDistant, and cold; or imitating her,As faults of higher station always gainPartial abettors, the neglected museHath to the parent in life's middle rankTuned her unfructuous lay; she shall not ceaseDesponding, weightier arguments for them,More strenuous, more coercive she can bring,To which perhaps self-interested loveWill ope their listening sense. Of mental joysAnd pure delight, they would not understand,Or relish the description. But if healthThey covet, nor before the genial primeWish the stern Fates to cut their vital thread,Those hearts may prove susceptible of fear,
Which instinct, love, and duty could despise.Nor seek We fabled incidents, to strikeWith superstitious dread the mind, but truth,Plain, honest truth, inspires the homely song.SHE who refuses to her Young One's lipHer swelling bosom, each returning yearConceives, and each returning year sustainsThe pangs of child-birth. Harass'd by fatigue,The strongest constitution droops; but soonThe weaker system, like a blighted flower,Falls underneath the shock. The nursing timeWas meant by wisest Nature, as a stay,A vacant interspace, in which the nerves,And threads of life unstrung, might re-assumeTheir native tone, endued again with strength,And corresponding freedom, to supportThe day of toil: As a sure medicine,To root out many an illness, else untamed,From the soft female frame: T'invigorateThe fragile texture, and with grateful force
Astringe the fibres, morbid and relax'd.But if not e'en these motives can persuade;T' improve her charms, new beauties to possess,Is Woman's utmost wish. View then the Fair,Who to this sweet employment turns her mind!Delighted Health sits on her polish'd brow,And shews the veins beneath? Spreads o'er her cheekThe vermil glow; her eyes with lustre fills;Decks her with radiant smiles, and all her formWith grace ineffable, and comelinessInvests. Enough of these—The Muse beholdsWith rapture some of other kind—Oh! hailYe real Mothers! Ye whose hearts are fullOf sensibility! Who highly pleased,Would not, for all the gewgaws Pride can boast,Loosen the magic knot, which joins in oneYour Babes and you; or see a Hireling shareThe love, which to a Mother sole belongs.O Thou, to whom, one of this pious train,I with esteem and veneration bend!Lead on with decent step, uncheck'd by fear,
To those domestic haunts, where peace expandsHer wings, and Harmony delighted dwells.Let me behold thee, rivet thy fix'd eyeOn the young infant Form, then press it close,Glose to thy throbbing heart, then on it's lipsA thousand kisses print, thy eyes with joyO'erslowing, in each feature nicely scann'dTracing the dear resemblance of it's fire.And lo! where pleased, beyond expression pleased,To see thee in the sweetest task employ'dOf female duty, where thy Husband hangsEnamour'd o'er thy bosom! not the nightWhich gave thee to his arms, bestow'd a joyTo this superior; thrilling to the mind,Sincere, and home-felt. O true name of love,Tender Affection! Genuine Source of blissImmaculate, and pure! The transient blazeOf passion soon subsides, thy steadier fireTime but increases! Soft coercive band,Connecting souls! Without thee, what is life!Mild Halcyon of the breast, whose summer wing
Calms every raging storm! To thee the wise,The good still offer incense; all who bearNo sordid stains; nor any but the dull,Or grovelling, in her parsimonious moodBy nature form'd, or whom with iron handTyrannic Custom rules, despise thy sway.THRICE happy She, by inclination led,By nought with-held, to add this pleasing link,This heart-endearing bond, to the sweet tiesOf married love! But should'st thou e'er be doom'dVotaress of truth and virtue, to resistTh' attractive warmth by their eternal handsImplanted; to resist the liberal callOf duty and desire; condemned by ailsFrom causes unforeseen to tear the PledgeFrom thy fond bosom; while thy sickening heartBleeds at the thought, condemn'd another's careT' invoke for him, the Babe, thy straining eyesGaze on with nameless pleasure: Let my layDirect thy choice for the momentous task
Whom to retain, what Parent to adoptFor thy unconscious young one; for from herNot only nutriment perhaps he takes,To life and growth subservient, but who knowsHow far the stamina yet unevolved,How far the soul herself as yet unformed,For texture, vigour, passions, intellect,On this thy act depend? Far from the boundsOf the rank city, let some trusty FriendExplore the straw-rooft cott; there, firm of nerveHer blood from every grosser particle,By hardy labour, and abstemious Fare,Sublimed; the honest peasant's mate shall opeHer hospitable arms, receive with joyThe infant Stranger, and profusely yieldHer pure balsamic nurture to his lip.But since the keenest eye may be deceived,And vice will lurk amid the country hauntsTo innocence devoted, it were meetT' investigate among the village TribeTheir Neighbour's mode of life. Heeds she the laws
Of matron-like sobriety? Her fame,Is it from all suspicion clear? Her soul,To wedlock true? Feels she a Parent's love?To her own Offspring tenderly benign?Does she her husband's constant heart possess?Nor seeks he foreign pleasure? Every doubtExtinguish'd here; still curiously persist,Nor terminate thy search; examine roundHer little mansion, see if there, in spiteOf poverty, the step of cleanliness,Attractive Nymph, unhesitating treads.Her age too claims thy notice; let not timeOn restless wing have stolen from her faceThe bloom -of youth, nor be she green in years.For torpid, or impaired by frequent use,The flexile vessels which convolved in mazeWrapp'd within maze, secrete the purer stream,Their office will more sparingly perform,Or less nutritious particles supply.And if thy nurse be young, the thoughtful mindOf prudence, would not to her charge confide
What claims exactest assiduity,And serious vigilance. There are who thinkToo subtile in their theory, the NurseShould with the Mother aptly coincideIn age and temperament; but heeding wellThe precepts we have given, thou may'st neglectSuch trivial niceness; Health from each extremeRemoved, is not to colour of the hair,Or to complexion tinged with red or brownConsined: Excess thou should'st indeed avoidOf plump or lean, nor would I choose th' adustAnd highly bilious, or the sable hueOf clouded melancholy. Be it thenThy primal care to fix on vigorous healthAdorn'd with smiles, the lovely progenyOf constant cheerfulness, and sweet content.Nor would I (tho confest a qualityInferior in it's kind) not prize the voiceFrom harshness free, whose soft tone can composeThe froward Babe, or gently bid it wake,And view the young-eyed morn. O thou, who help'st
To throng the crowded Town, restrain'd by forceWithin that court of death, where every galeIs tainted with pollution; did the MuseIf some sad cause forbade thee to pursueThe Mother's genuine office, to the fieldsSerene, and rural Lares order forthThy tender Infant? not from needless fearsAnd vain precaution, did she dare to thwartThe dictates of humanity. She sees,What do not to thy eye perhaps appear,The dreadful train of ills, which swarm withinTh' unhallow'd precincts. Well she knows how fewOut of the many myriads city-bornSurvive, in just proportion scann'd with thoseWho bask in freer day. Yet, much availsA Parent's unabating love, and sharpIs absence to the soul. But can'st thou purgeTh' unwholesome atmosphere, gravid with seedsOf latent sickness? Suffocation fell,Angina, Apthous Sores, Eruptions dire,Pertussis sierce, and squalid Atrophy?
Say, can'st thou bid the flagging South speed by,Nor stagnant, o'er his much-loved mansion broodWith darkening plume, of poison and of deathProlific? When each danger I review,Shudd'ring with fear, I scarce would bid thee proveThe Nurse's task, tho nought should interveneOf fatal accident, and thou art boundBy every tie of nature to the deed.For can'st thou round thy Infant's brow entwineA magic wreath? Or cause an Angel liftHis shielding arm? Thou can'st not: Follow thenThe precepts of experience; yet let oftMaternal fondness guide thee to the placeWhere rests the little sojourner, there viewHow cherish'd, how improved, and lingering chideThe rapid step of still-progressive time,Which hurries thee reluctantly away.BUT can the Mother change unblamed the town,For some sequester'd villa? What denies,Her bed of sickness quitted, to retreat
And seek the haunts, where Peace on flowers reclinedLists to the warbling songster of the grove?Or from the gently-rising hill surveysThe grazing herds, and rivulet which windsMeand'ring thro the distant vale? Where HealthSports on the level green, and young delightSmiling attends: Where bounteous Nature shedsHer choicest blessings, and with guardian wingProtects her favourite progeny. Retire,My fair Disciple, haste to scenes like these,And underneath thy roof invite to dwellThe Fosterer of thy child. Despise, with me,Th' insipid train of vanity and pride;The foppery of custom; quaint paradeOf ceremonial visit; idle farceOf masquerade, or ball, where real joyNe'er entered; conversations gayly dull,Unblest by exiled friendship; glare of courts;And mummery of the Great. Be't thine to walkWith Reason, and enjoy th' harmonious voiceOf conscious Rectitude, whose soothing strain
Can lift the soul beyond what vulgar thoughtCan distantly imagine. If thou mustRequire another's aid thy place to fill,Her conduct thou direct, and regulateThe manner of her life, a pleasure thisInferior, yet affording ample roomTo gratify the smer nerve of love.To see thy Substitute at stated timesThe life-sustaining food supply, to markHow thrives her young Dependent, and each dayAppears addition manifest to gainIn size and stature, while his eyes beam forth,At least to Fancy's peering search, the dawnOf future reason, and intelligence.HERE, as in all things, Nature opens wideHer page instructive. Did'st thou not beholdHow in her homely dwelling, Health imbuedWith reseate tint the cheeks, and firmly strungThe muscles of her elder boy thy NurseHath left behind? She was not surfeited
With dainty cates, and high luxurious fareWhen him she suckled; never did a draughtStronger than water pass her thirsty lip;Pernicious ale she knew not. When releasedFrom short confinement, to her various wantsNo Friend, no Servant minister'd; her BabeShe fill'd, then gave up to the soft embraceOf sleep; meanwhile no sedentary lifeShe led, she spun the woof, in order meetShe set her cott, the viands she prepared,With which at even-tide to welcome homeThe Husband whom she loved: Or in her armsBearing her grateful burthen, out she hied,Braving the summer's heat, or winter's cold,And as she walk'd, caroll'd th' incondite layOf rustic merriment. Seek not to changeHer usual regimen, for if thou dost,Should she escape the fever which impends,Expect thy Child, attack'd by cholic pangs,To writhe in torture, or perhaps at onceConvulsions sierce shall snatch him from the world.
For now her stomach, which from diet hard,By habit's force, and potent exerciseElaborated chyle of blandest sort,Oppress'd by crudities, corrupts the bloodWith viscid recrement. Or else the Brain,That source of motion, urged by sympathy,Creates new impulses of morbid kindThe vital threads affecting, and from thenceTh' elastic arteries, and ruddy streamWithin their coats contain'd, the different glandsTheir various store secreting, nor escapesAmong the rest the lacteal tide, the food,By nature, of thy Child, but now his bane.O HABIT! Powerful Ruler of Mankind!Great Principle of action! ReconciledBy thee to every clime, the human RaceO'erspread this globe; around the frozen poleScorn the stern brow of Winter, nor beneathTh' equator's torrid influence, dread the shaftsOf vengeful Phoebus; thou presidest well-pleased
Over th' innocuous vegetable meal,Which on the banks of Ganges, or of Ind,Satiates the temperate Bramin. Thou can'st tameTo wholesome nourishment the sanguine feastOf th' ever-roving Scythian. To thy lawsWe subjugate the willing neck, profestThy vassals; nor the mental facultiesDost thou not sway; by thee inwrapt in mazeOf subtle politics, the Statesman plansHis fraudful schemes unceasing. Thou sustain'stThe Sage who labours for the public goodWith patriot care, though oftentimes assail'dBy black ingratitude. The midnight lampOf meditation, trimm'd by thee, revealsTo keen Philosophy Truth's awful face,And all his toil is pleasure. Led by thee,The Bard retreats from Vice's noisy reign,And in the secret grot with Fancy holdsDelicious converse, while her hand withdrawsThe veil from Memory's ideal store,And all th' associated tribe of thought
Displays before his view. Still may I bendBefore thy shrine, O Habit, when thy rulesWith Nature's disagree not, (neither thenMay we unpunish'd break them,) else in vainShalt thou attempt to fasten round my heart;For know, that Reason, and her Sister Form,Fair Virtue, can untwist thy magic cords,And to their will, tho not annihilate,Can all thy laws attemper and refine.END OF THE FIRST BOOK.INFANCY, A DIDACTIC POEM. BOOK II.ARGUMENT.Introduction, and Address to Humanity and Simplicity.—Importance of the subject.—Nursery, not unworthy the notice of Fathers.—Aliment of Infants.—Milk, the only provision of Nature.—Folly of giving them various kinds of food, and especially of feeding them by night.—Additional food when Infants gain the age of two months.—Not to be fed in such a quantity, as that their stomachs may reject the Aliment.—Apolo-gy for Mothers being led into error.—Description of Prejudice in general.—Mothers should strive against its power.—Ill effects of repletion, even in grown persons.—Nature to be satisfied, not over-loaded.—Healthy appearance of Children temperately brought up, and pleasing prospect of their future behaviour in life by that means.—Weakly Children, though sometimes of quick apprehensions, not likely to perform the active duties of life.—The Storgè, or natural affection of Parents to their Offspring, may be carried to excess.—Weaning.—The fittest time when Children are about nine months old.—Before this, proper to accustom them to other food.—Vegetables alone, the cause of many complaints to Children.—Importance of the female Character.BOOK THE SECOND.ARE there with pride elate, who cast a glanceOf supercilious scorn on strains like these,Stiling them low? While sweet HumanityAttentive listens, vain the Cynic sneer,Or Cynic frown. She, her warm cheek suffusedWith blushes sprung from conscious virtue, ownsShe thinks no task too mean, no work too low,Whose end is public good; would save a life,Rather than deck herself in glittering robes,And boast of titled honours; sooner giveOne ornament to grace the Common-weal,Than purchase a whole empory of wit.Come modest Dame, and o'er my numbers meekPreside; come with Simplicity, who hatesThe swelling phrase bombast, th' insipid termPompously introduced, as Artists vile
O'er forms uncouth their dazzling colours spread,And mock the eye: She too shall bid the trainOf haughty Ignorance (for 'tis the curseOf Pride to be with Ignorance conjoined)Keep far aloof, nor read the hallow'd lay.YET not alone to Women do We write,The Nurse or Mother. Subjects such as theseOft have the Sages old of Greece or RomeIn studious mood employed; full well they knewThat from the birth those Heroes must be form'd,Whom Athens might with future joy admireOr hardy Sparta: Heroes who might urgeTo their sublimest pitch the rights of men,Brave every danger for their Country's cause,And make the Persian tremble, tho inclosedBy countless Millions: Heroes who might actDeeds which the Gracchi would not blush to own,Or Scipio, bravest, noblest of mankind.Themes such as these employ'd the generous soulOf Locke, when with the patriot spirit fired
Of Plato or Lycurgus, He assay'dThe manly task, from custom's harpy claws,And the soft lap of luxury, to snatchThe Babe t' enervate idleness foredoom'd,Or sickly languor; to connect his mindWith vigorous organs, it's impulsive willApt to perform, and run with ease and strengthThe great and difficult career of life;Desirous to behold our British YouthOut-rival ancient fame. Come then ye Sires,Whom love of Offspring, or of Country sways!You will approve my verse; the Nursery's careFrom you will gain attention. Wisdom's voice,And deep philosophy to you have taughtIt's consequence, and worth. Oh! aid the toilOf a fond Mother, with your reason guideHer gentler faculties; invigorateHer virtuous weakness; to your well-known voiceShe will, she cannot but with pleasure yield,And follow precepts sanctisied by You.
WHAT aliment the tender Babe requires,How best sustain'd, the Muse proceeds to sing.To Nature then attend: She hath preparedNo food but milk alone, and if it flowsIn plenteous rills, abundant is the store.Thus fed, the lamb over the grassy turfSports frolicksome; the patient ox who turnsSweltering all day the stubborn glebe, by thisNourish'd at first, his present strength acquired.And will thy Infant cease to thrive, suppliedWith this nepenthe? Rather He will gainNew vigour every hour, and healthful smileTho sickness scoul around. Yet some there areWho fill from morn to noon, from noon to eve,Nay thro the hours of night, the suffering ChildWith various cates, heedless of nature's lore,Cruelly kind, unknowing that they thusFatten a victim for the hungry grave.For from repletion, every ill severeWhich threatens childhood, arm'd with keener force,Invades the delicate frame. How oft 'twere sit
The Suckling should imbibe the milky stream,From the first dawn of morning, till the sunSet in the west, experience must evince.All do not feed alike, some greedilyDrain at a meal the lacteal beverage,Others more nice require the frequent treat.YET when Night spreads her mantle o'er the Globe,And leads on sleep and silence, it is meetT' obey her mandate; rest thy careful headO Mother, let thy tender Nurseling rest.Why wilt Thou anxious to thyself createUnnecessary pain? At evening closeForth from her den starts the fell Lioness,And thro the gloomy desart urges onEager for prey her rapid step, She leavesHer sleeping young one, nor expects he foodTill she return with morning's early beam.Yet this is He, who shall hereafter reignLord of the forest, and with kingly voiceAppal his listening subjects. But thy heart
Is soft, and cannot bear thy Infant's cries.Oh! Heaven forbid that I should wish thy breastSteel'd to his real misery! But theseAre cries which evil custom hath begot,And blind indulgence; unalarm'd sustainA few short trials, bear unmoved the shockAt first; indulged not, He will fret no more.Believe me, nor from hunger, nor from painThese wailings spring. How different is the shriek,And agonizing groan, from sobs like these,Transient, and humorsome! To cloath thy ChildWith health some little violence endure:Nor to the dictates plain of candid truthThy ancient Nurse's doating saws prefer.THE Stomach ever full, is ever weak:But from refreshing sleep and abstinenceDigestion thrives, and kindliest nutrimentTh' absorbent veins inhale, wherewith the warmAnd plastic arteries by due degreesUpbuild the human fabric; or by which
Each slender thread and fibre is evolved,Gaining mysteriously their destined bulkAnd firm elastic motion. Robb'd of sleepThe Warrior droops his head, and longs no moreTo plunge amid the fight: The Rustic faintsVigorous e'erwhile, nor strains his sinewy armsHolding the plough, but nerveless and unmann'dPresses his homely pallet, sending forthVain wishes to the Power who from him flies.And can the gentle frame of Woman bearConstant disturbance and unrest? Her strengthMelts down apace, the bloom forsakes her cheeks,A peevish listlessness succeeds, she pines,And over-sedulous is now unfitTo fill that office which she most desires.WOULD'ST Thou thy Child to pass the hours of nightWrapt in sleep's downy plumage? Banish farThe lazy cradle, useless but to giveRelief to th' indolent attendant race,Who fain would batten in perpetual sloth,
Who shrink at slightest toil, and ill deserveThe viands they devour. At first indeed,During the circuit of a moon or twain'Tis fit thy Charge should only eat and sleep;Nature demands it. Afterward contractThe hours of sleep by day, and in th' embraceOf carefulness let exercise divertThe lively Infant; chiefly when his eyeNow looks around unknowing what he sees,Now when he springs, and spreads his little arms,And smiles, and utters sounds which strike thine earWith wondrous pleasure. Tho We now permitSome added food, its quality regard,As of important consequence. We praiseAbove the rest, the farinaceous tribe,Bread well-fermented, unadulterateWith deleterious alum, this with milkAnd with the limpid element decoct.Yet always mindful of the golden mean,Be even this with moderation used,Nor ever glut the stomach till it loathes,
And the superfluous aliment rejects.The wrinkled Sibyl laugh to scorn, and allHer dreams fallacious, when pronouncing thisA sign of health. Nature indeed is kind,And various her attempts t' evacuateWhat would be noxious, and 'tis well thy ChildHath still sufficing strength. But he, poor Babe,Had he the sense to guide his appetite,Would shun this consequence of mere excess,No proof of health, disgustful to the eye.WE blame thee not for yielding to the voiceOf Error; if beneath the solemn garbOf old experience hid, and self-convinced,Not meaning to deceive, how should thy youngUntutor'd mind resist her lore? But whenTruth meets thy sight, and pointing shews the wayTo Nature's bower, thy blind associate quit,Enter the hallow'd shade, converse with herPure Nymph, peruse her lineaments divine,And to her voice impartial ope thy heart.IT is not strange that Prejudice should gainAccess to thy soft bosom. Who can boastHis freedom? Wide and potent is her sway.No Fiend in stronger bonds hath held enslavedThe groaning nations. In Cimmerian gloom,Where light ne'er penetrates, but Darkness sitsIn fixt essential majesty enthroned,Unconscious Sloth, by Ignorance compress'd,Brought forth this Monster. To the haunts of menTaking her way, the stars grew pale; her wingsShe spread incumbent o'er the subject world,Nor suffered men to view what slender boundsDivided them from brutes; in torpid statePlunged deep, they lay supine for many an age,Till Aegypt first rebell'd: Mother of arts,And boasted fount of wisdom. Yet, tho boldTh' adventure, She to burst the galling chainStrove unsuccessful. Mid the twilight grovesOf sacred Memphis, on the banks of Nile,Prolific, wondrous stream, or round the wallsOf hundred-gated Thebes, in union close
With Superstition dwelt the Pest abhorr'd;And underneath her hieroglyphic veilIncongruous forms commingled. Nor in GreeceReign'd she less absolute; her Sages henceBuilt their fallacious systems, airy shades,And phantoms of the brain; with wordy warFought in defence each of his waking dream,And suffer'd Truth with Socrates t' expire.How long beneath her power did Europe bend!Prompted by her, Ambition eagle-wing'dTaught ancient Rome amid the lust of sway,Intent on crimson conquest, to neglectHumanity and virtue; till the pileBy valour rear'd, fell from it's giddy height,Shatter'd within by luxury, withoutAssail'd by savage fierceness. Then what depthOf native gloom, of thick-incircling night,Witness'd her presence! Every art was lost,Each effort of the mind; or else sunk lowGrouch'd to the yoke; while o'er the puzzled schools
Exalted, shook his worse than iron rodThe Tyrant Stagyrite; and Physic awedBy Galen's sullen Genius dared not heal.Each lovelier grace, each elegance unknown,Each genuine ornament, till Taste, o'erwhelm'dWith death-like Sleep, in Leo's age revived.Philosophy extinct, till Bacon roseThe morning star of science, by whose beamsTransfixt, as erst the fabled Python fell,Lay vanquish'd huge Authority. Then firstExperiment with radiant lamp disclosedThe stores of bigot Time, and taught with niceLaborious hand from each fictious gemTo separate the true. Hence day by dayThe rigid shackles fall self-loosed, or braceMankind less strictly; we for Nature's lawsRead Nature only; Wisdom smiles serene,With freedom bless'd, and Fools alone are slaves.AND say wilt Thou in this enlightened ageO Mother, single stand, and lend thine ear
To hoar, and quaint Tradition? Wilt thou treatThy Child by their opinion, whose adviceThou would'st not follow in one act beside?Judge by thyself. What languor, what fatigueAttends the fuller meal! What dire effects,What tumults oft from the crude surfeit rise!And why is reason thine, if not with careTo govern him whose yet unripen'd frameOf sense is vacant? Tho with greater ease,His stomach may the superplus expel,Than older gluttony; yet caution dreadsEvents unfortunate, the nerves convulsed,Fever, and each ill symptom which attendsThe growing teeth. Unskill'd to curb himself,His appetite guide thou: So, duly fed,Each meal affording what may satisfy,Not burthen nature, on thy happy ChildHygeia shall with eye propitious look.His shall be comely vigour, winning smiles,Freedom from pain, protection from disease,And stamina well-knit to undergo
Each future change of ever-varying life,Each toil, each danger, nay perhaps a baseOn which hereafter may be firmly rear'dEach virtue, social, public, warm, resined,Each intellectual, moral excellence.FOR tho the Child of weaker nerves may seemWith quickest parts endow'd, yet should he riseThro numerous perils to the height of Man,Oppress'd with listless torpor, how can heBrave the meridian ray of public life?Reflecting on himself, how shall his mindExpand t'ward other's feelings? Nay too oftThose blossoms immature of sense, on whichWe gaze with pleasure and astonishment,Spontaneous from the blighted stalk descend,Or yield harsh, tasteless fruit. This stroke severeThou shalt avoid, more rationally kind.If form'd by nature delicate, thy loveGuided by judgment, shall his strength improve;At least his weakness, or th' effects it brings,
Shall not proceed from errors of thy own,Thou wilt not gorge thy Child; and all night longHe sleeps serene, an interval of rest,In which the stomach clear'd of every loadFortuitous, its healthful state preserves.He wakes alert, prompted by hunger keenT' imbibe the draught nutritious. Thee too SleepHath charm'd with opiate rod, no froward cries,No tortures of thy Infant, caused by crude,Unwholesome, or accumulated fare,Have broke thy tranquil slumbers. Thou too seestPlacid the break of morn, and to thy BabeThe well-secreted, copious alimentPreparest to give; which, sad anxietyAnd restless hours, (in her, who idly fond,And painfully solicitous, hath watch'dThe night, for other purposes design'd)Rob of its balmy essence, else derivedSprightly and plenteous from the genial chyle,A weak, thin, vapid, unsubstantial juice;Whence to the tender organs of her Babe
A morbid irritation, which destroysTheir natural, and necessary tone,Till haply dire disease, or death ensues.Is there a stronger principle infix'dIn human nature, than the zealous warmthA Mother t'ward her Infant feels? Yet thinIs the barrier dividing right from wrong,Virtue from vice. The noblest qualitiesIndulged t' excess, a different hue assume,No longer noble. Courage may be changedTo brutal force; to prodigalityThe generous sentiment; to licence rudeFreedom's bright flame; and tender nuptial loveTo mean uxoriousness. What siner joysInspire the soul more exquisitely form'd,By vulgar minds unheeded! But bewareLest sensibility itself, uncheck'd,Extinguish it's delights; lest pity bleedAt every pore, intolerable smartEnduring; lest the softer passion urge
If unsuccessful, to the wan abodeOf madness or despair; lest taste exactTurn to fastidious niceness, covetingWith vain desire, among the works of men,To find perfection. Thou too curb thy zealO Mother, that impulsive ardour rule,That love inordinate, which urges onTo weakness, and perverts to criminalThe sweetest, best emotions of thy soul.WHENCE is this nameless Energy? this powerSo forcibly attractive? who intwinedIt's subtle threads? and round the willing heartBraced firm the cord mysterious? Who, but He!The prime Intelligence! Who first call'd forthFrom warring Chaos this fair frame of things!Who bade each part with animation glow!And what He will'd t' exist, in order dueNot of continued, but successive lifeWill'd to preserve. Who taught the winged race 340Among impervious shades, with matchless skill,
To form their nests, and guard their callow brood.The Natives of the fields, and desart wilds,A fit retreat to seek, the rocky cave,Thicket, or mountain high. Who gives them allA thousand wiles, a thousand stratagemsOf crafty policy, from hostile forceTo save their Young; and to defend them, fillsE'en the most timid with impetuous strength,And sense of prowess never felt before.Instinct alone, their Tutoress and Guide;But Instinct and superior Reason thine.THUS while nine Moons have known increase and waneTaught to proceed, the pleasing task of careIs still unfinish'd, much remains unsung.Now is the Season by experience deem'dMost meet, an arduous duty to attempt.Arduous to some; but not to thee, whose mindReason enlightens with a clearer ray,Shewing the bounds between parental love,And it's fond foolish mimic. Thou canst look
Beyond the present, no dull slave of sense,And for a lasting good, most willinglyEndure some transient pain. Thy Child long timeFed by thy vital fluid, now requiresDismission from the breast. Yet not at once,As some have taught erroneous; such our frameThat every rash and sudden change may proveThe source of harm. More wise and cautious ThouBreak thro the tye of habit by degrees;And ere the stream maternal be refused,His taste to different nutriment incline.BESIDES th' increase of food ere while allow'dWhat diet do we grant? Some would deferTo years more vigorous, all, that tyrant Man,The universal glutton, from the raceThat grazes on the plain, or skims the flood,Or cleaves with nimble wing the yielding air,Culls for his use; and would not that the childShould taste of aught but what the fruitful earthPlant, herb, or grain produces, with the stream
The lowing kine afford. There are no doubtWho to the latest stage of life arrive,Thus always nourish'd. On the shores of IndCheck't by religious fears, whole Tribes refuseTo bathe their hands in blood, lest thro the woundA kindred soul should fly; yet some pass throA century of years (so fame reports)By sickness unsubdued. Where high ascendOur Caledonian hills, the hardy NorthA gallant Offspring boasts, whom Fate deniesT' indulge, except in vegetable meals.Yet when their country rouses them to arms,Waving her standard to their view, they rushImpetuous forth, and terrible in war,Dread as the Lion hurt, in every climeThey fight, they conquer, hearing but their nameThe distant Foe grows pale. Yet prone to doubt,The Sage these fair examples will not trust,Implicitly believing. He will judgeNot from a race of men by habit sway'd,By custom harden'd, not from every rare
Occurrence of longevity; or thoseThe minions of their clan, who seek the fieldsWhere rages fell Bellona. He requiresA strict impartial list, to know if moreOf these, compared with others, ere the forceOf potent use hath nature's influence changed,Escape unhurt, and reach life's grateful primeActive, proportion'd, vigorous. And here,These distant facts still undetermined left,Th' instructive Muse shall teach from what her eyesHave clearly seen; though social, not inclinedTo luxury's various table, tho humane,No follower of the Samian Sect. Howe'erThe Infant form'd perhaps with stronger nerves,Or of peculiar nature, may escapeThe blasting hand of sickness, or may thriveOn vegetable fare, yet oft we viewWhere poverty more generous food denies,Tottering Rachitis seize it's helpless prey;Or flow-consuming Tabes; or withinHis mazy labyrinth, the tortuous Worm
Finding a sure asylum, multipliesHis noisome produce. Hence th' unwieldy head,Distended joints, limbs variously incurved.Hence the sunk cheek, the hollow lifeless eye:Hence loss of balmy sleep, and appetite,Convulsive motions, agonizing spasms,And symptoms, which in order to describe,Had foil'd the Coan Sage. For maugre thoseWho idly speculate, by fancy ruled,Or superstition; Nature, we assert,Form'd us, with mingled diet, herb, root, seed,And animal, to gratify our taste,Or foster life; a truth, th' AnatomistPlainly demonstrates; nor will Reason's mindAdmit a doubt. The crude or sluggish juiceWhich vegetables yield, with toil perspired,Weakens the stomach, whose contraction failsNot justly stimulated: while the skinIt's pores block'd up, or e'en it's texture changed,Is cover'd o'er with incrustations fouScarcely, if ever, by th' abstersive wave
Of tepid bath removed. But if by fateThese viands are refused, condemn'd to tasteNought but bird, fish, or beast, a putrid massIs gender'd, which pollutes the vital slood,And taints each humour, till the general frameDissolves as in a thaw. These truths regard;By Nature heeded, when with care She form'dThe lacteal fluid; a peculiar Mixt,Skilfully blended; by digestion due,Or in it's winding passage thro the glandsAnimalized, and render'd fit to tameThe ferment of acidity, to whichChildhood is prone. Whence we conclude, that nowWhen from the breast exiled, as far as ArtHer nicer laws can imitate, 'tis rightT' adapt it's food, and mingle alimentOf alkalescent quality, with thatWhich might t' incorrigible acid turn.THIS to prevent, haply the bounteous streamsOf Pales, from each wholesome leaf, each soft
And verdant shoot, secreted, which investGrateful, the dewy meadow, tho conceivedOf virtues rare, and th' intermediate linkOf animal and vegetable kind,Will want sufficient power. We fear not thenTo bid thee from the herd or flock derivePart of thy Infant's sustenance; but stillWith licence circumscribed. As yet the spoonRetaining, covet not with firmer meats,To satiate hunger, till the rising teethSpring from their latent seeds, and deck the mouth,Two rows of clearest white. The Fibres else,Impacted, will not to digestion yield,A harden'd, tough, indomitable mass:Nor will the salivary Glands emitTheir needful liquid. By compulsive fireRather extract the pure nutritious juice,Mix'd with the virgin lymph; with this combineThe generous gifts of Ceres; and beholdThe Dairy offers it's nectareous store;And Carolina sends her pearly grain.
RARE, and more rarely, now thy breast unveil,Nor to a distant day protract the timeOf final separation; He requiresNo farther aid of thine; thee other caresHaply demand, thee other duties; go,Thou wert not form'd for One alone, tho dear;Go, bless thy Husband with a numerous race,Beauteous like this, like this with health adorn'd.How high the rank in life of Womankind!Their station how important! Hapless HeWho lives unconscious of their worth! The FoolOf grosser sense, or airy LibertineWho draws his judgment from the forward few,Or yielding weak, and dares with impious tonguePronounce them all the slaves of vanity,By passion ever led, by flattery won.Their frame like our's, but with ethereal touchMore delicately limb'd. The same their souls,More soft, more sensible, and more refined.Each uncontaminated Briton owns
And feels their virtues. Polishers of life!Sweeteners of savage care! Who tune the breastTo harmony, or prompt to glorious deedsAnd emulative toil. To friendship's flame,To gratitude, how exquisitely true!Who tender confidence repay with love,Integrity unshaken, faith most pure,Warm, zealous loyalty. With honour clad,As with a robe, and beauteous ornamentsOf unaffected modesty. Well-skill'dTo form the growing soul, and on its youngAnd opening bud to fix th' impression deepOf every generous thought, which stimulatesThe future Man, to love of Parents, Friends,Offspring, and sacred Freedom, while as yetCorruption suffers, in her favourite IsleThe Goddess to reside. Far hence, away,Ye groveling Sensualists, to Eastern climes!Where lust, and barbarous jealousy immureThe passive slaves! What joy can beauty give,When strays th' unfetter'd will? Or when in calm,
And thinking hour, the mind unsatisfiedContemns the looser Objects of desire,Pining for sympathy? And feels a void,Which roving licence never can supply?The wanton dance, the soft voluptuous strainSung to the melting viol, nought inspires,But languor and disgust. Mistaken Men!Who lose the better portion of their time,The dear domestic hour; the converse bland,Fruition of the soul, love's balmy zestWhich never cloys; parental cares conjoin'd;Divided griefs; reciprocal delights;The Life of Nature, Reason, Virtue, Bliss.END OF THE SECOND BOOK.INFANCY, A DIDACTIC POEM.

BOOK THE THIRD.AGAIN from busy care, from thoughts which preyOn the reflecting mind, from the rank walksOf Men, where folly dwells, and base design,And flattery mean, and servile complaisance,From the dissembled Friend whose hollow heartProfessing service, aims but to deceive,I seek the Muse; whose charms can softly stealAffliction from itself, whose power can smootheThe paths of rugged toil, can heal the woundOf discontent, and calm the throbbing breastOf indignation. To my theme againWell-pleased I turn, and view the simple raceOf Infant Innocence, as yet unwarp'dBy education, blameless nature their's,And passions undebauch'd, from envy free,
From guile, and that assembled crew of illsProduced by commerce with a tainted world.AND say wilt Thou (to whom long since had flow'dThe grateful strain, if apprehensive doubtHad not shrunk fearful from the public eye,And dreaded lest thy praises should appearLink'd to our slighted numbers.) Say, wilt Thou,CULLEN! Unrivall'd Master of thy art!Of soul acute throughout the winding mazeOf every devious system, to pursueAnd mark the steps of error! By whose aidEdina rears her Academic palm!While to thy precepts listening, gathers roundAttentive Youth from each far-distant shore,And bigot envy droops beneath the rayOf thy superior lustre! In whose heartDwells candour, inmate of the truly great,And modest diffidence. Whom judgment sageBy long experience taught, directs to fixThe bounds of theory, ne'er own'd a guide
But where observance faithfully severeHath ceased to pry; yet by her labours skill'd,As with a glance, nicely to separateWhat vulgar minds by seeming likeness caught,Absurdly blend; and deem thy conduct rash,Till they behold with wonder health arrayThose cheeks in rosy mantle, lately view'dAs death's pale harbingers. For to thy eyeMemory her fairest tablet swift presents,And method gives that readiness of thoughtBy them ascribed to fancy, but which springsFrom painful application. Say wilt ThouAccept our tributary verse? Thou wilt.For in thy breast the softer graces dwell,Nor hath Philosophy with stern controulLessen'd the milder virtues of the Man;Thine is the breath sincere of friendship, thineCompassion's unaffected ardour, thineThe Husband's and the Father's tender love,And warm benevolence incircling all.AT length, from stricter vigilance, the ChildIs freed O Mother, wean'd from thy embrace.Yet the refused thy bosom, still attendWith guardian mind, still prize our lays, for thee,For Him, attuned; sincere, however elseWanting due ornament; nor haply needsImportant truth the vivid dress of words,The tinsel decorations which the songInferior claims. Nine moons are past, twelve moreAs we have taught, proceed; such thrifty fareIs best; thy Child's pure nature doth not askVariety of meats. He thrives, He grows,His cheeks unsullied bloom, his soul expands,Thou seest his smiles, his gay incessant voiceResounds; what covets thy fond wish? And nowHis strength increased, his more elastic limbsBy constant motion exercised, his teethGiven for utility, not shew, demandFood more substantial. Yet, by every graceWhich doth, or ought t' inspire the female breast,By holy temperance, by every nice
Exciting sensibility, but chiefBy that internal sting which goads the soulTo potent love of offspring, I conjure,I charge thee, Mother, Friend, with strict regardConsult thy Child's unvitiated taste.Oh! as Thou would'st th' invenom'd adder shun,Renounce their false opinion, who seducedBy ignorance misjudging, think whate'erDelights their grosser appetites, will pleaseWill suit his unhabituated lip;And thus unknowing but with liberal handCherish their Babes with poison. Wretched Race!Unconscious Criminals! Murthering thro loveThe hapless Beings they would die to save.By social laws estranged from Nature's paths,We lead an artificial life; and feelUnnumber'd wants, which indolence begetsOn fond imagination. Polisht high,The cultivated manners yield no doubtJoys of superior kind; hence speaks the stone
At sculpture's touch, the breathing Canvas lives,And Poetry and Music fire the soul.A thousand nameless elegancies mixOur jarring minds, and by collision softVanquish their native roughness; modest LoveBinds her enchanting Cestus; on our stepsThe Graces wait; we drop the tear humaneOf sacred pity; and BenevolenceTho powerless to relieve, affords a sigh.The chaster Genius of convivial mirthAround our table smiles, and drives far offBrutal ebriety; profusion yieldsThe place to neatness; and th' internal senseIs caterer to th' external. Thus upraisedBy slow degrees from barbarism obscureMan gains his elevation. Oh! how blest,Could ever-roving Fancy be content!But always on the wing She strains her slightIn quest of novelty. Hence every threadFine-stretch'd before, must still be finer drawn.Our polisht manners turn to frivolous;
The soul of Art neglected, We beholdThe outward shew; unskill'd to comprehendThe large design, on parts minute, on toys,And splendid colourings we doat; rejectThe strain emphatic, curious of the phraseUncommon, or sonorons period round;And music must surprize, not charm the heart.To elegance succeeds the spurious broodOf soft voluptuousness. Love, holy love,The fairest flower life's garden e'er can boast,Falls to the ground, and changeful wantonnessRank particolour'd weed springs forth, sure baneTo every virtue. Pity dwindles downTo mean self-love; and seeming generous,We're but the slaves of vanity. We seekWe covet the protracted meal, and stillGoad, as it palls, our jaded appetiteWith new incentives. Ransack every elime,Commerce the boasted cause, for every rareAnd stimulating condiment, spread o'erOur northern boards the spices of the south,
Adapted to it's habitants, to usNoxious, and only fit to gratifyThe sense debauch'd which loathes it's proper fare.FOR by cold gales our muscles firmly bracedAct with due force: Or else th' ethereal streamPerhaps condensed, flows stronger from the brain,And gives to every limb it's healthful tone.Not so beneath more torrid Heavens, there sinkThe vital powers, to mortal languor doom'd,Unless excited by the quickening warmthOf aliment more active. What to themNature commands, to us her laws forbid.And tho unconscious of immediate ill,At length the stomach, harrasst and o'erwornBy this licentious diet, fails; the pulseWeakly contracts, each nerve decays, old ageHastes immaturely on, and round the browScatters untimely snows. The softer SexIndulging thus, besides the common lot,Suffer peculiar accidents, which well
The skilful Muse, if so inclined, could sing.E'en accidents which thwart the general law,Nor to their much-desiring souls allowTo clasp a Child, and bear a Mother's name.BUT whether Thou beneath the sordid yokeOf luxury wilt not bend, and truly wise,Refined, but not enervate, view'st with joyThe plain and frugal table, such as erstAngels and Patriarchs sought: Or whether warp'dBy tyrant custom, as we blushing ownMany there are in these degenerate days,Women, the worst of Epicures; removeFar from thy Children each high-seasoned dish,Each sauce impregnate with the seeds of fire,Each spice, and pungent vegetable, noneAdmit, of foreign or of native growth.SHORT is the time stretch'd to its utmost dateOf Man's existence; to contract thy ownIntent, yet spare thy Child; draw not a veil
O'er the young morn of life: From thee He springs,Would'st thou so quickly trace his setting beam?Plunged in death's sable wave ere thou hast runThy own brief day? Daughter of Fashion! no.Tho all thy relative affections fade,And every soft sensation droops beneathThe sickly blast of pleasure, tho thou flit'stOn giddy plume and thoughtless, mid the wildsOf vanity and folly, we acquitThy devious soul of wilful homicide.Read then our moral page, and better taught,Know right from wrong, and sense, by action, prove.Should'st thou reject our lays (as who can scanThe deeds of mad caprice?) well-pleased we turnFrom gay saloons, from courts, from haughty wealth,And midnight riot, to more gentle scenes,Sure of the spotless heart, and it's applause.LEARN from thy Child, O Parent! He will teachFull oft the diet suited to his frame.View with what marks of loathing, He at first
Rejects the hot and acrid; instinct dwellsWithin, a faithful guard; his rapid pulseAnd native warmth by these are quickly urgedBeyond their bounds. He relishes the bland,And to thy taste insipid; these controulEach motion, nor permit his heat to riseAbove it's due degree. Nor less he shunsDestructive Bacchus; why then will his SireBy frequent repetition strive t' o'ercomeNature's dislike? why, but because himselfFond of the rosy God, and led astrayBy reverend prejudice, he wholesome deemsThe fever-stirring draught? Nor wants he namesOf high authority, Physicians sageTo justify his creed. But Use destroysThe benefit He seeks, and if diseaseShould wine's assistance claim, it then may loseIts medicinal power. To every wordEach act attentive, Children imitateWhate'er they see or hear; this principleStrongly within their little breasts alive,
Impels them oft to venture hardy warAgainst antipathy. Of this beware,The struggle nicely mark, and point their aimTo proper objects. Nor because You praiseThe circling glass, and they with many a sipVanquish their feelings, deem that Nature promptsTo what, except more rarely, it abhors.INDULGE aversion, combat with desire;A maxim safe and just; for this, by ArtMisled, may urge to danger, but t' abstainWill prove at least innocuous. Nor believeThat from ourselves We judge, and interdictWhat our own taste refuses. When the frameIs perfect, when the fibres have acquiredTheir utmost growth, more steady are the lawsOf our corporeal organs, less disturbed,To change less subject. Never would I shunThe friendly intercourse of souls, which wineIn moderate draughts augments. We know it's powerTo cheer the wretch desponding and forlorn
Upon the sickly couch; to mitigateStern fever's putrid vehemence; exciteThe torpid heart, till it propell anewThe languid-circling blood, in every veinMore strenuously alive; to calm the rageOf phrenzy, and imagination's tideVague-shifting to controul, till reason smile.Full well we know it's power to raise the strengthOf drooping age, and in his sluggish limbsAwake the latent fire. But Childhood needsNo foreign aid to stimulate the brain.Ever with rapid speed from forth that fountOf heat and motion bursts the nervous stream;Each irritable fibre is full-fraughtAlmost t' excess, nor asks the least supply.Canst thou improve on Nature? She this storePuts to it's proper use; this urges onIn due proportion each increasing tube,Muscle, and bone, and ligament. Canst thouDirect her actions? Rather shalt thou findT' exceed, will cause defect, thy Child curtail'd
Of his just size and stature, weak, and wan.And should He rush hereafter, madly rushAmid th' intemperate herd, and daily seekThe noisy rout of Comus, how, too lateWilt thou repentant mourn thy rash exploit,His appetite first led astray by thee,His early relish of the fervid bowl!NICE, and perhaps erroneous in their plan,The younger animals as yielding lessOf due nutrition, and digested slow,Some disallow. That, food prepared from thoseOf growth mature, thro th' intestinal mazeLess tardily proceeds, we not deny:More acrid are the juices it contains,Whence stimulating more; it's fibres hardWith labour wrought to chyle. The young are bland,Composed of humours suited to the young,Viscous, nutritious, slower in their course.But as th' absorbents greedily imbibeWhate'er is nutritive, by this delay
They drink their fill, and to the solids addThe mild tenacious substance. Yet, not boundTo partial theory, without reserveWe bid thee take thy choice of all the tribesWhich bounteous Heaven affords, and common useBefore thee sets, of every age and size.All but the stall'd, and cramm'd, by filthy slothAnd gluttony, perverted from the stateOf wholesome nature; send the mass corruptOf nauseous humours, and of rancid oilFar from thy board. In simplest manner drest,Of these one daily meal we grant thy child,But not commixt, his be one dish alone.Grudge not with these of vegetable storeA plenteous portion, nor permit the breadTo lye untouch'd beside him. Thus indulgeHis appetite, and let him freely eatTill hunger be sufficed. This rule observe;All animals which wildly range the earth,Or fluid air, and all of vigorous ageWith flesh of darker grain, experience finds
More alkalescent, these the freer useOf plants and herbs acescent will demand.The tame, the young, and those of whiter hue,Require them less. Heed well what we condemn;All things which housewife art with care preserves,Acid, or salt, or saccharine: all catesOf unfermented flour composed, or thoseOf fulsome sweetness, and enrich'd with wine.THESE let thy Child avoid. And be his drinkThe purest element, with which of old,Heroes, and Champions at th' Olympic games,Sated their thirst, and glorious deeds perform'd,In war, and manly exercise; or HeThe Heaven-devoted Nazarene, to whomCords were as threads, when fired with holy zealHe burst his bonds, and with his single handHew'd down opposing armies. Hence each spring,And limpid fountain, every stream which flow'dSoft-murmuring o'er it's pebbled bed, was gracedBy wise antiquity with hallowed forms,
Pure nymphs, and gentle Naiads. Well they knewThe virtues of the crystal wave, e'er vileFermented liquors had enslaved their taste,And thinn'd mankind. Pass we th' Atlantic foam,Where Britain o'er her Alien Sons now claimsDisputed sway; a hardy people thereInhabited, bold, active, in the chaceUnequall'd, patient of fatigue, to foesTho unrelenting, yet to honour just,True to their plighted faith, to strangers kind,Not one of limb deform'd, or trembling nerveAmong them dwelt, and numerous were the tribes.WE did not root them out with savage hand,And bathe their fields in blood, but to their lipsMore slyly proffer'd the Circean charm.They drank the poison down, and by degreesRelinquish'd their paternal fields to us.Rare, scatter'd are their clans, some quite extinct,Potent of yore, ere the destroying draughtWas introduced. The remnant are corrupt,
Perfidious, treacherous; European cupsHave taught them every European vice.Still flourishing perhaps, had they disdain'dThe snare, contented with the simple streamsWhich issue from their rocks. Give then thy ChildThe blameless fluid, friendly to mankind,From whence Hygeia fills her sacred urn,Nectar of paradise; nor will He gainUnless debauch'd, a liquor to his tasteMore grateful. Nay, would'st thou, if age permit,And strength unbroken, thy example add,Trust me no other beverage will so wellAssist digestion, none the spirits cheer,Inspire with calm serenity the mind,And make the night glide by in tranquil sleep.BUT lo! where with Vertumnus comes the NymphPresiding o'er the garden, in her handWaves Amalthea's horn, whence prodigalHer freshest store descends. She asks me, whyThis long neglect? And bids me sing her gifts.
Her various fruits, whose juices the warm fdunBy secret fermentation hath maturedFrom aqueous, acid, bitter, and austereTo rich luxurious flavour. Hither leadThe Childish train indulgent, let not fearIn scanty measure to their taste impartThe ripe and wholesome banquet. Still while rollThe summer months along, while heat intenfeDarts through our frame, and stimulates our nerves,Till languor each o'erlabour'd thread subdue,And in each tube the purple current teemsWith seeds of putrid violence, to themThe summer months innocuous roll along,Innocuous glows the fervid sky, controul'dTheir baneful influence by Pomona's aid.FOR them, unsparing (for we scarce can setThe limits of restriction) pluck thy fruits,Nature's delicious antidote 'gainst allThe hidden venom of the fultry year,Mild. cooling, saponaceous. nutritive.
For them the blushing berry underneathIt's verdant leaf is hid, for them adornsIt's rough and prickly shrub, for them dependsThe clustering currant from it's smoother stem.For them is deck'd each tree. The ruddy peach,The golden apricot, the cherry, boastOf Kentish soil, the fragrant nectarine,The plum, green, purple, azure, the moist pear,The apple, theme of the Silurian Bard,In fulness of profusion grow for them.Nor would I when by chance more vigorous sunsIt's harshness meliorate, not cull for themTh' autumnal grape, nor to their lips forbidThe well-rear'd melon, nor th' Ananas' richAnd poignant crispness. They are form'd for all,And all for them. More cautiously supplyWhate'er by rough or bitter husk and shellIs circumscribed, and all the hoard which asksThe mellowing hand of age. Or those we gainFrom climes far-distant, ere they have acquiredTheir just perfection gather'd; shaddock crude,
Pomegranate, orange. Let Hesperia's Sons,Let th' Antillean Planter, or the TribesOf fertile Asia, gratify their tasteWith all th' unlabour'd bounty of their soil;Yet is not our's ungrateful; industryHere cloathes our fields, our gardens, and our groves,With plenty all it's own; Pomona smiles;For cultivation oft bestows a zest,Which wild exuberant Nature would deny.ERE yet we close the strain, one error moreThe Muse will combat. Tenderness may promptWhene'er thy Child shall ask thee, to bestowThe needless viand. In his younger daysWe bound thee not to rules. But now when o'erHis head four annual suns have roll'd, adviseThat he be taught submission to the lawsOf social life, which stated hours appointsFor action, and repast. Nor heed the voiceOf ignorance, which talks of exercise,And quick digestion. Often well we know
The vicious taste of idle wantonnessDemands restraint. But lest to thee it seemAs real hunger, from the coarser loaf,A pure, tho homely nutriment, supplyHis craving; thus, with certainty detectFictitious appetite. His other mealsYet undirected, both at morn and eve,Be fresh drawn broths, and milk in various formsWith rice, or other farinaceous grainInspissated. We would not stint thy Child,And know his growth requires a constant fluxOf plastic fluids; nay, 'tis best to err,If err, in quantity; the flexile tubesOf Children, will perhaps with ease transpireWhat is redundant. But with heed observe:Add thy discretion to the Muse's lore:And reason, and experience be thy guides.Now duly taught by thy maternal care,O never may He turn his vagrant stepsAside to dwell mid the polluted tents
Of bestial luxury! We would not wishA stoical indifference, to flyForever those delights which sway mankind,Th' exhilarating bowl, which opes the heart;And festive banquet, where preside the powersOf wit and decent mirth; but may He live,Born for society, no hermit sour,Or driveling moralist, absurdly grave,And singularly dull. Temperate by choice,But not austerely abstinent. By theeIs the foundation in his primal yearsFirm laid, by which he need not sacrificeTo rigid niceness; but with health his friend,Will not start back from every little change,Which weaker habits must with caution shun,Or cannot with impunity indulge.Thine is the work, and gratitude shall thenRepay the debt, the filial debt he owes.Then shalt thou feel, tho strong th' instinctive tyeOf blind affection, what sublimer joys
Reason affords, the generous mutual bond,Thy tender love, his tribute of the soul.THUS far the Muse Didactic hath assay'dHer purposed theme, scattering before the stepsOf Truth and Science, o'er their toilsome pathsThe not unfrequent flower; the sweets which bloomOn those delicious banks forever green,Fed by translucent rills which murmuring sweepO'er sands of gold; where Fancy loveliest NymphDelighted strays, or with the Sylvan powers,Dryads, and Fauns, disporting, joins the dance;And sings her wildest note; or silent stands,Her roving eye, her giddy step enthrall'd,Attentive to Minerva's heavenly voice,Enamour'd of her wisdom; and from HerReceives the potent wand by Judgment form'd,And waves it o'er her works, which thence remainUnfading and immortal. Rest not hereO Virgin, still be Infant Man thy theme;And what of cloathing, what of exercise
He needs, relate: nor his diseases scornWith hand benign to paint, and teach the cure.THOU wilt not, if the sharp inclement airOf cold neglect freeze not thy vital warmth,And in the cave of solitude fast bindThy wings aspiring, which shall shed their plumesOf varied die, or fold thee ever roundIn sullen indignation. Rather farFrom thee be thoughts like these! Stoop not thy soulTo fears of vulgar nature; high aboveThis sordid earth direct thy piercing eye,And view where rear'd beyond the gulph of DeathStands Fame's refulgent dome, to living WightAye inaccessible. Still, as of yoreThou sought'st th' Ascrean, or the Mantuan Bard,Thy visions spread before my raptured sight,And soothe my ear with those celestial strains,Which on Olympus' lofty top reclined,Charm Jove himself: while virtue, reason, truth,Humanity, and love, each sound applaud,
And bless th' unprostituted lyre. Oh! hailYe pure, ethereal Bards, who nobly stoop'dTo teach mankind! who round the flowing locksOf fancy, cast the sacred wreathe, inwoveBy the fair fingers of Utility,Which scorns caprice, and whim, amusive toys,And trifles vain, th' unprofitable gawdsWhich catch the light and airy mind of Youth,Or vacant Pleasure! Hail again ye Bards!Nor only ye of Greece and Rome, who firstStole from the croud profane my chastened thoughts,And as I gazed upon your page, inspiredThe holy frenzy of ambitious love,Aiming with ardent, but successless toil,To emulate your beauties! Ye too hailYe sons of Britain! Masters of the song!Thou AKENSIDE, late wept by every Muse,Whose skilful hand unlock'd the secret sourceOf mental pleasure, founded in the new,The graceful, and sublime! Nor blind to worth,Tho still upon this wave-worn shore it stand
Of troublous life, by envy's blasts assail'dBe thou ungreeted, ARMSTRONG, in my verse,Thou Parent of the Prophylactic Lay!Nor MASON, thou, whose polisht taste instructsTo form the English Garden, mingling artWith rural wildness, and simplicity!Nor BEATTIE, Friend of Truth, whose Gothic harpAs if from magic touch, emit such tones,That e'en Apollo might his lyre forget,And wonder at the harmony; while pleased,In Edwin's ripening Genius, we beholdThe progress of thy own! Hail too ye FriendsOf Nature, and the Muse, of soul refined,Of judgment unimpair'd, by slavish ArtUnmanacled, who feeling, dare confessThe pleasure which Ye feel! who mid the scenesOf calm retirement, from the genuine cupNectareous, virtue-crown'd, drink true delight!While the mad riotous crew at distance heard,Disturb not your pure ears, nor aught inspire
But pity and contempt? To you aloneThese Bards have sung, to you alone I sing.O LET me mingle with the hallowed band,By you exalted! Let me scorn with you,The base, luxurious, dissipated Great;Who to the yoke of every foreign viceBow down the neck disgraceful, and retainOnly the name of Britons. Strangers TheyTo every wish, each thought of nobler kind,Absorb'd in selfish joys, of public good,Of private virtue, heedless. Skill'd to game,To waste their trifling hours beneath the shadeOf indolence, to steer the fragile barkO'er the smooth wave of folly. They applaudWhat taste condemns; their highest excellence,To deck with richest offerings the vain shrineOf those Musicians, who distort the mostThe native elegance, and most polluteEach charm of Melody, or those who urgeThe human voice divine to heights which well
Madness might emulate: While JACKSON'S strainsBreathing in every note the soul of love,Of passion, feeling, sense, and sentiment,Flow unrewarded; save that Nature standsListening, and drinks in every thrilling sound.Delicious, but unprofitable meedOf elevated Genius! Fond of shew,Of pompous scenes, of barren novelties,Of tortured incidents, and poor finesse,Filch'd from the Gallic, or Italian stage,They relish not, while they pretend t' admireOur Shakespeare's matchless energy. The voiceOf wisdom they despise; the sacred lyreThey trample in the dust; a catch, a glee,A song obscene, a libel, which destroysSome good man's peace of mind, and blasts his fame;Strikes their weak souls with rapture. Wedded loveThey slout to scorn; posterity with themIs lighter than a shade; a rapid whirlOf vice fantastic hurries on their lives;And e'en the Flatterer whom they feed, would blush
To praise their memory. Is this the Race,O Britain, Nurse sublime of Heroes old,Of Patriots, Sages, who thy state have raisedTo it's all-envied height! Is this the RaceDestined to guide thy counsels? form thy laws?Croud thy once-awful Senate? Against these,Must public spirit idly strain the nerve?To these, must worth, and modest merit yield?The reptile spawn of insignificance,Corruption-foster'd? Then farewell to allThy boasted glories! Stile thyself no moreThe Queen of Nations; levell'd with the meanAnd undistinguish'd kingdoms of the Earth.Thou hast been free! The Aera will arrive;Thou shalt be free no more! O'er folly, vice,Aristrocratic faction shall usurp,Or bold, and enterprising MonarchyWith justice claim dominion. 'Tis most fit.A mid th' extensive records of mankind,It ne'er was found, that freedom could surviveWhere honour dwelt not; where with careless eye,
Or, but intent on pleasure, Luxury satAnd view'd her chain, unmoved, where love of fame,Where the keen hopes of future praise, no moreAwoke the generous deed, the grateful praise,Paid by posterity to liberal souls,Who plan the good of ages. Yet, at onceQuit not this Isle O Virtue! In the scenes,The lower scenes of action, linger still.Far from the plague-struck Capital, inspireThe honest individual; in his soulCherish the warm affections; let him feelThe joys of unpolluted love, and thinkHis offspring worth his care! Still may'st Thou walkOn Isca's banks where thro the blooming valeIt's lucid stream meanders, and receiveThe Orisons, which there thy Votaries pourFrom hearts unconscious of deceit, untaughtThe false refinements of superior life!Blest by the Muse, in nuptial friendship, blest,Forbid th' external sight of things, withinIllumed by goodness, and the beams serene
Which taste, which wisdom, and contentment shed,May BLACKLOCK still enfold thee? May'st Thou dwellFrom pride far distant, from the tyrant sway,And noon-tide glare of vanity, with Him,And his Compatriots! Drop th' expressive tearO'er GREGORYS' tomb; in whom alive, combinedAll, that the sapient head, or feeling heart,Proclaim; and admiration, and esteem,And reverence, move! Then cast thy eyes around,And own Thou ne'er beheld'st a soil more pure!A soil, where manly parts, and sense acuteSpontaneous grow, and every female graceAdorns with innocence and chaste reserveThe Matron's bosom. Spite of Southern pride,The rancorous lye, or partial ridicule,It's Sons and Daughters perfect in their kind.In bravery, worth unquestion'd, strength of soul,In modest tenderness, domestic charms,Tho equall'd, ne'er surpast. Thus may'st Thou stillPreserve a Few from the contagious airWhich luxury breathes! A remnant whence to learn
What Britons erst have been! Preserve them Heaven!And when they cast the page of flattery by,Let them with kindred warmth these notes approve,And say, The Strains are our's, for Us attuned,And for the sake of Children yet unborn.END OF THE THIRD BOOK.INFANCY, A DIDACTIC POEM. BOOK IV.ARGUMENT.Introduction.—Address to Mr Godrington.—Subject of the Book proposed, viz. Cloathing, Heat, and Cold. Nature still to be attended to.—Infants not so susceptible of cold as is generally imagined.—Other causes occasioning their first cries.—Might bear even severity of cold though naked.—Their Cloathing to be light and perfectly easy.—Animadversion on different treatment of them, not so necessary now, as when Swathing was more in use.—Description of that custom, and it's ill effects.—Daughters were confined still longer.—The unnatural attempt to procure them what was called a fine shape, ridiculed.—No part of the body to be loaded.—The head, the legs, and feet to be uncovered.—Cleanliness insisted on.—Regard due to good Servants, and Nurses.—Excess of heat to be avoided, whether communicated by contact, or by weight of bed-cloaths.—Communicated warmth when particularly useful.—Cold Bath recommended.—Apostrophe to the Springs, Rivers, &c.BOOK THE FOURTH.SWEET is the breath of Fame, and o'er the soulOf Youth, on Fancy's pinions wasted back,The daring Visitor of times unknown,And future ages, like a spicy breezeSteals her delicious fragrance; like a breezeFrom Zeylon or Sumatra, which enchantsThe Sailors heart, tho night involves the coast,And hides it's lovely foliage from his view:While in his mind He sees the blooming groves,And haply thinks them fairer than they are.SWEET o'er my bosom stole the breath of FameIn early life, on Fancy's pinions borne;Th' ideal prospects rose supremely fair,And in extatic vision I beheldPerennial bays distinguishing my tomb.
For not unuseful, or of light importThe strains I sung. And though mid glades obscureDwelt the sequester'd Muse, from riot far,From pomp imperious, and the lordly boardBegirt with servile slatterers, yet her breastBy human kindness sway'd, where'er had piercedThe British language, manners, arts, and arms,Revered the Good; and base-born Envy dead,Or vanquisht, or engaged with living worth,Exulted in th' esteem of times to come,And Virtue's mutual friendship unreserved.In distant Continents, where horrid WarNow stains with Brother's blood the guilty soil,In distant Islands, mid their nodding palms,And growing sweets, her eyes survey'd with joyThe willing Parent bending o'er her lay.DEAR to the youthful mind, ye Prospects hail!Ye Visions wide-removed! for deep Ye thrill'd,Fixing, as real, all your traces there.And, if illusive all, yet riper Age
Can scarce believe the flattering scenes untrue,Or cease the vivid colours to beholdBright glowing thro the shadowy lapse of years.MEANWHILE, O CODRINGTON! whose generous heartBlames not the tenor of my partial song;By whom uncensured flows the self-applause.Whose temper, mild as an autumnal sky,No cloud obscures; with feelings warm, yet ruledBy cautious judgment, in whose breast residesFriendship's pure Heaven-descended flame; aliveTo all a Parent's fondest love; yet bothUnder superior reason's nice controulDirected to their truest end and use!For thee, and such as thee, an audience small,In space and number circumscribed, by wealth,By rank and titles undebased, againI venture the Pierian spring to seek,And tread on sacred ground. How difficultWhere, thro the laurel groves, and myrtle shades,The verdant alleys, lawns, and rising slopes,
Thick strewn with flowers of every various hue,Of every various season, Elegance,Coy Nymph, unsated wanders, on each sceneWith curious eye commenting, from the sweets,The never-fading blooms, each virid arch,Selecting meetest garlands, to suspendUpon the tree of Taste, most eminentIn the poetic region, underneathWhose fragrant shelter, Phoebus and the NineIn chorus met, attune their happier strainsOf rarest harmony: How difficult,By Health and Youth attended, to pursueThe bashful Maid, attract her favouring eye,And wooe Her to bestow a single wreathe!CAN I then hope, whom sickness long hath drench'dIn her Lethaean dews, with feeble limbs,And wan complection, from her hands to bearThose gifts, which unpossesst, my lays must creepDully monotonous, nor touch the heart,Nor win th' approving mind? Yet, witness Thou!
Witness my Friend! Who know'st the human frame,Each drug of cordial, each of healing power,To me in vain administer'd, what toilI must experience now, the Nymph to traceThrough her meand'ring walks! what partial chanceShould she my languid homage not disdain!YET, thy inciting voice; the conscious thoughtSprung from the love of kind, which tells Me, allWill not be frustrate, nor the darling wishOf public good be wholly unfulfill'd;Some loitering sparks of that once brighter flameMy soul enkindling, prompt me to a taskLong interrupted: Where in slumbers deepIt rests, t' awaken the Didactic Lyre;With it's more solemn notes to mingle tones(So they to memory fail not to recur)Oft heard of yore, as t' ward the lucid fountI stole, not unforbidden; tones which pleaseHeighten'd the more by contrast, and engageAmusive the charm'd ear, till it imbibe
Instruction with delight, till melodyNot the chief object seem, it's liquid voiceYielding to reason's energy divine.OF Cloathing now, of Heat, and Cold We sing,Unanimating themes; but which requireTh' attention of the Bard, as not of useInferior to the subjects which erewhileHe strove t' adorn; nor claiming notice lessFrom the true bosom of Parental Love.STILL heed We Nature, and her guiding stepsPursue; nor, tho with moans, and plaintive criesFrom his concealment issues to the lightMan's tender Progeny, believe, He feelsTh' external air his undefended frameKeenly invade. These moans, these cries proceedFrom other causes. To his lungs at once,Expanding their nice substance, rushes inThe forceful air. The circulating bloodAlters it's course, thro channels unessay'd
Impell'd, whose first resistance haply claimExertions of the labouring heart, quick, strong,If not convulsive, yet irregular.Exertions of the lungs themselves, to gainTheir necessary powers, and genial spring.Add too that oft each muscle, every limbStrain'd and compresst, scarce bears the gentlest touch,Sore from the late hard conflict undergone,And agonies maternal. But to cold,Know, He is born impassive; or at leastWith vital warmth supplied, to render vainIt's most severe assault; beyond the scaleOf heat which stimulates maturer age.HE needs not Art's assistant hand, or dressOf studied care. Uncloath'd, in wilder climes,Like the more hardy natives of the soil,E'en in the polar regions, He might braveThe freezing atmosphere. Nay, unwith-heldBy dubious fears, tho placed indeed beneathMore favouring skies, there are, who from his birth
Plunge th' infant stranger in the gelid wave,Where unappall'd the mother too enjoysThe bath's refreshing coolness. But, nor harsh,Nor fanciful, We shall not recommendTo Thee, more delicate in form and mind,Daughter of Britain, these examples, drawnFrom savage nations, and from tribes remote.Cloath'd be thy Child; so polisht custom wills,And decent manners: But in airy garb,Loose, and uncinctured. Thus He shall avoidThe torment of accumulated heat,Nor from unnatural coercion feelDistress and anguish. With minuter rulesTo croud the page, and dull or quaint describeHis vesture, what materials should composeEach article, and whether by the loop,Or pin restrain'd, (tho as the last may bringDanger, nay death, the caution which forbidsIt's use, above the trivial-seeming causeImportant rises) descants such as these,Prolixly mean, would argue in the Muse
Failure of judgment, no respect to Thee.Suffice the general maxim; to dilate.And to the test each consequence reduce,Be thine. Bright glows the warm maternal soul,And clear, illumined by a hint alone.NOR flows with that necessity the strain,As erst it might, when barbarous hands aroundThe new-born Babe fold over fold inwreath'dThe circling band. Amid the wanton galesWhich Luxury breathes, amid the changeful swarmsWhich Fashion decks in her chameleon hues,Amid th' increasing follies of our age,And vices not perhaps destructive lessThan those of old, tho softer, milder far,Link'd with humanity, and taught to charm,To poison by politeness; Justice owns,While the rough virtues of our ancestorsAnd manly genius We no more behold:Our souls revolt from habits which enslavedUnamiable their Minds, and from the sway
Of Prejudice, whose galling shackles longTheir vigorous faculties controul'd. This truthJustice confesses, this, th' instructive Muse.GLADLY, O Mother! We congratulateThy Infant, who from life's first dawn enjoysHis birth-right, who the vital air at willInhales, nor feels corporeal bonds. With meRevert thine eyes, and Lo! their hapless Sons,How braced and pinion'd, who t' extend the reignOf civil liberty, with ardour toil'd,Who fought, who bled t' extend it. (Nor escapedThe Race preceding our's.) See, where they lye,True objects of compassion! round them closeIs fixt the painful bandage, not a limbCan move; sad victims to th' erroneous creedWhich holds that Nature incompletely acts,And forms defective works, that Art may giveThe strength by her refused, and perfect thusTh' unfinisht system, gasping they reclineIn real martyrdom. The shriek is heard,
The groan, the sob expressive, but in vain.In vain the little Captive, as awhileReleased from durance, utters sounds of joy,Stretches his arms well-pleased, and smiles, and castsHis looks delighted on the cheerful blaze,Or waving taper. To his fetters soonRemanded, He in vain attempts to copeWith arbitrary power, each effort tries,Shews by each deed th' abhorrence which He feels,Adding th' emphatic eloquence of tears,Of inarticulate, but deep distress,And struggles all-impassion'd to be free.WITH pity and contempt thy soul beholdsThis picture. What calamities ensued,Experience proved; but idiot bigotryConfess'd them not. Th' evolving principleWithin, the plastic juice augmenting size,Thus partially impeded, could not urgeThe destined fibres onward, or enlargeBy due accretion e'en the vital cells
Requiring speediest growth. Yet active still,In disproportion'd manner, to the headUnseemly bulk they added; or the jointsDistended, and relax'd. Or oft from painShrinking, the Child, unconscious but of ease,Curved by forced attitudes the flexile bones,Nay th' all-supporting spine. Th' obstructed breath,The fluids in their circulating courseUnnaturally check'd; th' irriguous glands;The fount whence motion, and sensation spring,And future intellect, the Brain itself,Disturbed, or with more lasting injuryImpresst, exclaim'd at this preposterous war,The war which Step-dame Art with Nature waged.CALL'D by society to tread the pathsOf busy life, from it's hard slavery soonThe stronger Sex was freed; and ere too late,Haply by Nature's potent air restored,Could boast a frame of vigour unimpair'd,And undeformed. But to long sufferings doom'd,
The female Race, so will'd perverted taste,For many a year pined underneath the forceOf this domestic torture. For as erstThe Mother strove t' assist their infant nerves,And give to weakness strength: She now assay'dHer progeny t' embellish, and their shapeTo mould, as fancied beauty in her eyeDeceptive shone. Heaven! that the human MindWarp'd by imagination, should believe,Or e'en suggest it possible, the form,Whose archetype the Deity HimselfCreated in his image, could be changedFrom it's divine proportion, and receiveBy alteration, comeliness and grace!That round the Zone which awkwardly reducedE'en to an insect ligament the waist,The blooming loves should sport, enticing charms,And young attractions! Heaven! that e'er a Bard,(The genuine Bard is Natures' sacred Priest)Forgetful of his charge, should deck with praiseAs fair and lovely, what would strike the soul
Unwarp'd by custom, as a subject fitFor scorn, indignant spleen, or ridicule.Yet Prior! tho nor taste nor reason blendTheir essence with the verse, while lasts the tongueThy numbers help'd to polish, while the powersOf melody bear sway, the verse shall live,Beauteous description of a Gothic Shape.OH! may the manners of thy nut-brown Maid,Her artless truth, simplicity of soul,Her fondness, and intrepid constancy,Long in the bosoms of the British Fair,Tho banisht every other region, dwell,Delighted inmates! May their eyes still beamWith all her speaking rays, their cheeks endueHer modest crimson! But may never more"The Boddice aptly laced" their panting heartsConfine, or mutilate that symmetryOf limb and figure, whence a Zeuxis' handHis all-accomplisht Helen might have form'd,Or a Praxiteles with happiest art
Sculptured a Venus. Tho Meridian dayBehold them drest as potent fashion bids,Girt with exterior ornaments uncouth,Trappings disgustful; yet at morn, or eve,Or when they to the genial bed repair,Still may they charm the melting eye of loveWith elegance and grace, the fabled DamesOf classic soil transcending, native grace,And elegance unveil'd, which mocks attire.RETURN Digressive Muse! t' approach the shoreOf Cyprus, or to breathe the tepid galesFrom Achedivias' Island wafted round,Is not thy choice; tho CAMOENS' Shade invite,And MICKLE with his glowing spirit fraught,As each heroic, so each scene of joyPaint with a Master's fire unlimitedBy cold translation. Never may our strainOne vague idea raise, which spotless mindsMay blush to own, much less insult the glance
Of virgin purity, or harshly woundThe conjugal and chaste maternal ear.DIGRESSIVE Muse return! our proper themeIs Man's first helpless state, our tuneful aidTh' ingenuous Parent claims. Resolved to blessThy Child with ease and freedom, taught to shunBy the dire act of Swathing, all constraintSo baneful, let no part escape thy care.Nor load the head; nor till he walk abroad,At least till firmly he can press the ground,Cover the legs or feet. Some precepts here,To Cloathing unattached, or slightly link'd,We mean t' inculcate. Need I then to thee,O Mother, whom the soul refined aloneCan prompt t' inspect my numbers, recommendThe Virtues' dear Correlative, (as TheyThe mental frame, so the corporeal, SheAdorning, rendering pure) the decent Maid,Unsullied Cleanliness, with Her full oftThy Charge to visit? Not that to her shrine
E'en from thy tender years thou hast not paidSincerest worship. But my words believe,Strict watchfulness the Menial Train require,And if, unheedful to their trust, they slightThe grave rebuke, dismiss them from thy doors.Not Their's the nicer sense inspiring Thee,Those principles and habits now intwinedIn union with thy nature. Nor is their'sThe Babe, who smarting from their sloth, with nervesKeenly alive, by the corrosive stingOf acrimony pierced, tormented shrieks,Or moans incessant. Neither scorn as vain,The dictates which succeed, from Reason learn'd.BANISH the softer couch; let not thy ChildRecline on down; his pliant bones but nowFrom cartilage emerging, on the bedWhich yields beneath his weight may haply gain,Thus frequently recumbent, a deformedAnd twisted aspect, by Chirurgic skillFor ever irreclaimable. Nor less
Such accident t' avoid, with cautious eyeTh' attendant mark, who bears him in her arms,And let Her oft his posture shift, oft changeFrom right to left, altern. A careless Tribe,Purchased by interest only, is the RaceTo servitude accustomed; trust not them.Trust thy own judgment, let thy ruling mindGovern each act of their's. Yet neither here,Nor elsewhere, mean We in a general blameT' involve them all. Some from attachment serve,And to constrictive duty add the tyeOf willing love. Such as a treasure prize,A countless treasure. Say, by One of theseIs thy Child foster'd? smoothe for her the brow,The tone of high command; let all her daysRoll on illumed by kindness and esteem;Think her thy fellow-labourer and thy friend;Alleviate every future ill of life,And, if thou can'st, remove them. Ne'er may SheWho with maternal prudence, and the warmthOf zeal affectionate, hath lent her aid
To form thy Children, to support, to raiseFrom perilous estate to strength and health,Feel the distressful sting of poverty,Or, if the means are not withheld, in theeWant a protector. But, if more than this,Her bosom hath the nutriment suppliedWhich thine refused, still more may she demand,And thou in justice grant the liberal boon.AND Oh! Ingenuous Youth! whose blood now flushtWith yet unsatiated desire, quick beatsIn every pulse, to mix in active lifeIntent, or climb where science points the way!Oh Virgin! Who with beauty deckt, and gayIn unperverted innocence aroundSurvey'st thy Homagers, yet covetestOne faithful heart alone. Oh! recollectHer assiduity, her diligence,And tender care, to which Thou owest the frameAble to cope with business, or sustainThe toil, which knowledge asks, to gather in
Her wide-spread harvest. That attentive zeal,To which thou owest the comeliness of shape,Those beauties which from every eye attractTh' applausive glance, and every breast inspireWith love or admiration. RecollectNot frigidly, or faintly, like the crewWho every pleasure center in themselves;Not with weak indecisive apathy;But with a bounteous and expanded soul,Estranged from self, replete with gratitude.BECAUSE the winged Nations fondly broodOver their unfledg'd Young; because We viewWhere'er reclined, her new-born Offspring pressClose to the Parent Quadruped; becauseBy instinct irresistible impell'dThe Mother longs t' embrace her infant Charge,And hide it in her bosom; while thro wilds,Or o'er the desart mountain as she roves,The Savage still her clinging Babe sustains:Some, this communicated warmth affirm
Is needful; and that Man's else-drooping RaceRequires the genial contact. Mindless they,How far from Nature's simpleness divergeOur steps, our every action. Were the ChildUnclad by day, unshelter'd thro the night,We should not hesitate to recommendWhat otherwise We smile at, or perchanceHold but of dubious consequence. Our laysHave taught what cold his system can repellFirst into light immerging: And if cloath'dAs custom bids, he from himself will gainThis added warmth, condensed, and on himselfRecoiling. Better thus, than haply sunkBeneath the load which our nocturnal restDemands, to feel th' intense phlogistic heatOf temporary fever, or to meltIn copious steam away. Much better thus,Than by the Mother or the Nurse oppresstIn heavy sleep, to frustrate all the schemesParental love had formed; or placed withinSome ancient Hireling's bed, instead of warmth
From generous blood, and balmy breath supplied,To warm the shrivell'd Dotard. But, if laidFrom thee remote, or in the couch with thineConjoin'd, why should'st Thou not examine wellAnd frequently his lodgment? so inform'd,Thou can'st not fail, O Mother! to perceiveWhat suits his constitution, what to add,What to subtract; doubtless thy native senseBeyond my strains will teach thee, that when rulesFierce Sirius, lighter vestments will suffice,Than when Aquarius opes his full-fraught urn,And Winter arm'd with piercing frost, defiesTh' unwarlike Sun. Thy prudent soul will knowHis limbs in health, blest with the temperate mean,Nor heat nor cold betray. Yet truth forbidsTo slight exceptions which are often foundEluding justest rules. Should some diseaseAttack thy Child, and anguish writhe his frame,To shivering pain thy near approach may giveSolace and ease, nay as it were, foment,Assuage, and lull the smart; or should He pine
With more than common weakness, from his birthAfflicted, blasted, or untimely bornWith nerves imperfect, as th' exotic flowerThrives not, but when included from the winds,It's fibres by the sun's concenter'd raysAre duly irritated, he may wantThy vital stimulating heat. But soonE'en then attempt increase of strength to giveBy other means; and seek at first the BathOf moderate temperature; by slow degreesProceeding, till his habit can supportThe powerful shock which colder lymph imparts.BUT so diffusive is the tyrant reignOf Fashion; such our table's proud excess;Such is our love of cards, time's Murderers,Keen agitators of the gentlest breasts,(Which ought to be the gentlest,) such those hours,Those midnight hours, corrodent of the bloomWhich else would decorate the female cheek,And animate the lips which now are pale:
Such the destructive arts, when beauty fades,It's meretricious semblance to display,The lifeless white, and never-varying blush;Detected by the curious eye, which hatesThe fraud, and painted Cytheraea scorns:Such are our Matrons, such, (except the Few,Who nobly singular behold, and smileAt Folly's deeds absurd) that all who springFrom them, may well partake the feeble nerve,And vapid blood, in which more faintly glowsThe living principle; and what for someWe erst prescribed, We now prescribe to All,To all their children; neither do We thinkEven to them the song may flow in vain;For should Caprice applaud, who oft usurpsThe throne of Sense, and guides the public taste,In her wild fit round Merit's brow the wreatheIntwining, which for Folly she design'd,They too may cast a glance across the pageWhich Fashion bids them read. Know then Ye Fair,Whom tho my heart approves not, I behold
With truest pity, know, th' unhappy BabesWhom you have toil'd unceasing to produceFragile and delicate, a word of your'sPerhaps may rescue from impending fate.Oh! issue your commands! great is the powerOf cold: Yourselves no doubt have often soughtIn fervid summer it's benign effectsIn the salt deep, whence braced You might endureThe winter's hard campaign. And hence new toneYour Offspring shall derive, their staminaIn some degree corrected, while the forceOf nervous influence more intensely thrillsTh' arterial frame, and the lax Muscle swells.YE Frigid Springs! wherever first appearYour bubbling sources, underneath the grot,Or pendent shade. Ye ever-living Streams!Where'er Ye wind pellucid thro the valesYour pastoral mazes, or o'er rocks abruptHurl down your dashing foam. Ye Rivers wide!Where'er in proud procession to the Main
Your copious tribute rolls: to You my songShould grateful rise—Ye Naiads! who directEach scatter'd rill, ere in coactive strengthThey flow exuberant; to your praise attunedShould sound the note melodious, and your namesWould I, ye Nymphs recount, and joyful paintYour attributes and virtues—But your Priest,Your favourite Akenside, his hallow'd laysHath not in vain effused, with pious voiceHymning your benefits; and all aroundYour sacred haunts hath cast a magic spell,Forbidding each profaner foot, the groves,The caves, the dells obscure where Ye sojourn,And your chaste bosoms shelter from the fireOf scorching Phoebus, wantonly t' approach,Or rudely violate. Nor shall my feetProfanely tread your dark-embowering shades,Nor shall my roving eye with curious searchYour deep recesses pierce. Yet, O Ye Springs!Ye Streams! Ye Rivers clear! And Thou, by whomThey all are fed, to whom they all return,
Exhaustless Ocean! with the general songWhich choral Nature pours, my voice shall joinTho undistinguish'd; and with all that creep,Or run, or fly, or vegetate, shall ownYour fructifying, life-preserving power.Your power, which Thales, which the Man of ThebesContemplating, affirm'd to listening Greece,That water all transcends, unrivall'd, best,The sole, prolific element of things.WHETHER your moisture cloathe th' exulting meadsWith herbage, or slow-deluging the plain,You fertilize the soil, while Millions viewThe prospect with delight, sure pledge of wealth,Of copious-teeming harvests. Whether softAnd gentle your refreshing dews descend,Absorbed by each inhalant leaf and flower.Whether your rains entangle as they fallTh' electric fluid, and with vital strengthEach seed inform, each fainting plant supply.
Whether You offer to the thirsty lipDelicious draughts; or to the anguid frameOf sickness your invigorating wavesWherein to bathe, and feel the tonic forceOf Cold at every trial brace the limbs,The heart, the brain re-act at every shock,Till all their pristine energy restoredThe fibres move responsive to their sway,And the once loitering blood propell'd anewWarm thro it's channels to the surface flows.You, mid the general song which Nature pours,My grateful strains shall praise. For, not UnreadIn Poeon's hallow'd lore, not uninform'dBy chemic Art, your healing qualitiesI too may boast to know; and whence derived,From earths, or salts, or mineral particles,Combined, suspended by attraction's laws,Or held in union by aerial chains,And crown'd with sprightly Gas. Hence, led by hope,By reason led, I drank with eager lip
At those salubrious springs which make renown'dOur British Baiae; but th' obstructing causeOf ill, or relaxation faint remain'd;Such mischief waits on sedentary hours,And studious midnight thought. Hence now the shoresOf hoary Neptune, hence the sounding cavesI seek, and turn to the refreshing breezeMy languid face, inhaling, as I sit,The briny spray; or mark the rising sunBeyond the vast expanse diffusing wideHis glorious beams, and at his orient lightDip in the fluid element; nor breatheTo either Power unheeded orisons.SURELY, not duped by Fancy, I perceiveAt times, as struggling to be free, the traceOf long-forgotten feelings! And my limbsMore firmly press the beach! And t'ward the floodI move, unaided by ministrant hands.
O DAWLISH! though unclassic be thy name,By every Muse unsung, should from thy tide,To keen poetic eyes alone reveal'd,(From the cerulean bosom of the deepAs Aphrodite rose of old) appearHealth's blooming Goddess, and benignant smileOn her true Votary; not Cythera's fane,Not Eryx, nor the laurel boughs which wavedOn Delos erst, Apollo's natal soil,However warm enthusiastic YouthDwelt on those seats enamour'd, shall to MeBe half so dear. To thee will I consignOften the timid Virgin, to thy pureIncircling waves; to thee will I consignThe feeble Matron, or the Child on whomThou may'st bestow a second happier birthFrom weakness into strength. And should I viewUnsetter'd with the sound firm-judging mind,Imagination too return, array'dIn her once-glowing vest, to thee my lyre
Shall oft be tuned, and to thy Nereids green,Long, long unnoticed in their haunts retired.Nor will I cease to prize thy lovely strand,Thy towering cliffs, nor the small babbling brookWhose shallow current laves thy thistled Vale.END OF THE FOURTH BOOK.INFANCY, A DIDACTIC POEM.

I consecrate to thee,To thee, and HUNTER, Rivals tho Ye are,Yet in my heart, my verse shall Ye be join'd,Both dear to Science, to your Country dear,Deserving public fame, and private love.SHALL HEWSON sink untimely to the grave,And I the note refuse? refuse to paintHis gentle manners, amiably humane,Winning with ease their unobtrusive wayInto the breast where Friendship and EsteemWith warm embrace received them? Or his soulInquisitive, and ardent to detectNature, howe'er conceal'd beneath a cloudObscure, and to the search of common eyesImpenetrable? Shall I not lamentHis talents render'd useless? And the bloomOf Genius wither'd in it's vernal morn.
WHEN Gratitude inspires the strain, shall BLACKRemain unsung? Who first the path essay'dWhich since by many a bold Adventurer trod,Hath open'd sources unexplored? disclosedSubtiler essences; to new pursuitsAwaken'd Chemic Art? And loosed the bondsOf it's establisht empire? No; while praiseHe covets not, and shrinks from due applause,The Muse shall not in silence praetermitHis lucid facts, and philosophic toil.THO foremost in the ranks of Being standThe Men, who active in the cause of truth,Divine, or moral, or to human lifeSubservient, with unceasing labour plyTheir task severe; to free th' embodied Mind,And it's ideas raise above the kenOf dull Mortality; by useful ArtsInvented, or improved, to subjugate,And undeceive reluctant Error, bringTo the true test of just experiment
Her specious visions, and elucidateHer dark perplexities; yet is not HeAmong the lowest, who their precepts strivesMore widely to disseminate, arrangeIn varied order their materials, placeObjects the same in different points of view,Or cloath'd in fresher garb, attention winBy seeming novelty. Nor shall the BardHowe'er condemn'd by folly, to the rankWhich petulance assigns Him deign to stoopHis crest indignant, while He feels withinThat living zeal, which by occasion fired,Would prompt his soul to dare celestial themes;Inforce the rules of action which connectEach social bond; or each ingenious modeOf Art unveil, whence profit or delightArise; and captivate with thrillings sweetOf unluxurious pleasure the nice earOf sensibility: With thoughts selectOn which no vulgar images intrudeTh' affections and the passions mingling bland.
ERE in our lays instructive, We proceed,And dedicate the verse to Exercise,'Twere fit to search with deep attentive careThe Human Fabric, it's component partsAnd Nature to determine, were it givenTo Poet or Philosopher to treatA subject so mysterious unreproved.MUCH hath Anatomy distinguish'd, muchRemains unknown; the rudiments of lifeWho ever shall explore? Where dwells the PowerInherent, or acquired, which first expandsThe comprehensive germ? Which moulds, propells,And inorganic fluid can convertTo animated fibre? In the BrainDoes it reside? Or in the central Heart?Or do they both their energy combine?Is it subtle, elastic, and derivedFrom that ethereal Essence which perchanceAll space informs, and every substance fills?Or is it from the blood by wondrous means
Secreted, render'd volatile, sublimed,A pure, peculiar spirit? From his stateOf vegetable torpor when released,Whate'er it be, by this the Infant lives,By this He moves; by this th' absorbents bearTheir nurture from the stomach to the veins,The wasted blood's supply, whose siner partsPerpetually exhale; this gives the lungsTo play, which from the circumambient airIt's vital principle inspire, and yieldTh' effete mephitic vapour back again.This stimulates the heart, and by the heartAnd irritated fibres is in turnExcited, quicken'd, strengthen'd: This extendsThe solids, and enlarges, hasting onThe circulating stream. This generates,Or is of living Heat the copious fount,Active while it exists, without it's aidSoon changed to deadly cold. By this, the nervesOf every various sense with speed conveyEach impulse to the Brain, infixing there
Th' indelible ideas, there arranged,Connected, modified, they haply formOr seem at least to form the Soul Itself,Immortal, immaterial: Hence the storesOf wisdom are establish'd; hence the flashOf wit bursts forth; and hence with keenest glanceImagination darts her eye throughoutThis mundane space, pierces beyond it's bounds,And Worlds creates, and Beings all her own.IS it of Heavenly origin? A ray,A portion of Divinity, this PowerMiraculously working? Guided sureBy other springs it acts than those of chance;For chance is nothing, a chimaera framedFrom non-existence by the breath of Fools.We see the deeds of highest Intellect,The finger of a God. Profound We bendIn adoration, and tho all his waysWe know not, tho implicit darkness hangOver this universe immense, confess
That nothing short of Deity, could e'erConceive, or raise the edifice of Man.YET, while the mystic elements of thingsAre undiscover'd still, while hidden lyeTh' interior Agents; while to Man himselfMan is a Being which his utmost painsHave fail'd to analyse; while tho we view,Or think we view the circling chain of lifeDepending link on link, in many a partChasms intervene, unfill'd but by the touchOf vague conjecture, or of fancy wild:The power of Observation is not givenIn vain; or handed down from Age to AgeFacts by experience sanctified; nor shinesFruitless the torch of clear Analogy.Or superseding all, the purest lightThe steadiest, Nature yields; unerring beams,Which point the way to truth, while Reason smiles,And Judgment walks secure. O Nature! thee,Goddess benign! when first this theme I chose
In early youth, with aspiration warmI call'd; thee vow'd to follow; unrepell'dBy Art's fastidious brow; or System's frown,Unwarp'd by Theory's delusive voice.For thou Alone the faithful MonitorArt placed within; thy motions if observed,Forever point to good. Nor will I nowDesert thee, or retract what then I swore.For not from Thee we only learn to raiseThe frame corporeal to it's destined pitchOf health and strength; to ward with certain shieldThe darts of sickness; or if rushing on,Disease o'erwhelm us with impetuous might,To catch the rapid moment, and at onceExpell the Foe, or waste his violenceBy due protraction, till he quit the field:But, if by tyrant Habit unenslaved,If unimpair'd by affectation vile,And imitative manners swimming downThe stream of head-long custom; Thine is allThe mental glory: Virtue, taste, design
Unborrow'd, glowing thoughts, expression strong,The full emphatic eloquence of prose,The liquid flow of melody, the burstOf torrent rapture, and each foaming waveWhich swells the boundless tide of verse sublime.To Nature then, with me, O Parent Mind!Stoop lowly; and observe her impulse rouseFrom his first slumbrous state awaked, thy Child.How soon, tho active vigour be denied,His arms, his feet the tendency displayTo loco-motion, and his roving eyeDarting swift glances; pleased that nought aroundShould be at rest, nor pleased with rest himself.INDULGING this propensity, to allHis free unfetter'd limbs allow their quickAnd yet unsteady efforts; let him gainFrom his Attendant, what he seems to ask,Perpetual exercise; tho not at firstTo agitation violent exposed,
Or tost in playful wantonness on high,But gradually proceeding. Treated thus,Kept in unceasing action while awake,He will not need the Cradle's most absurdPernicious motion, which the giddy brainConfuses, and benumbs; on him shall stealA softer, sweeter, more refreshing sleep.Nor blame the Muse, whose iterated strains,Neglecting slavish art, it's use forbid:Wishing th' Invention with deserv'd contemptExiled forever; with th' untoward Swing,The Go-cart, and the Leader, be it doom'dTo blank oblivion; or preserv'd with themOnly in some Museum's nitch devote,Teach future times, from past examples wise,More ardently to follow Nature's paths,Her simpleness to venerate, and ownHer all-sufficient dictates. Let thy ChildEnjoy his balmy slumber uncompell'd,Or by himself alone acquired, from dueInstinctive exercise: And let Him learn,
Untaught by others, his allotted talk,To creep, to stand, to walk; and let him knowFull early no assistance will be lentIn aught which by his proper strength and skillHe can accomplish. So shall strength and skillHourly increase; so He by days and monthsThe puny Infant shall excell, deprivedBy doating fondness of his native powers;Or to the care of Laziness assign'd,Who suffers Him with tottering step to dragIncumbent, while the faithful eye aloneShould watch, or ready hand with gentlest touchUphold. Nor think (an argument of yoreFor binding every limb) his tender formWill from his own exertions e'er receiveSubstantial injury; a posture wrongUneasiness will prompt Him to correct:Nor will his feebleness permit the forceInducing harm, so strictly to his weightProportion'd: And how soon, uncheckt by art,Inherent sense, will threatened danger shun,
Is wondrous. Vanquish then ideal fears.And on the matt, or carpet let him sport,And feel his growing vigour; or enticeTo their extremest verge his infant sightWith becks, and smiles, and captivating toys.FOR ends most wise, and most important, flowsRedundantly profuse within thy ChildThis active principle. By ExerciseThe quicken'd pulse and stimulated heartMore truly shape each fibre, give to eachTheir tension, and elastic spring; urge onIn swift and properly successive wavesThe crimson fluid, and from thence secernThe different humours, healthy, bland and pure,While thro their various channels are detach'dThe recremental dregs, of acrid kind,Or fraught with particles to human lifeDestructive. Exercise supports the flameOf life itself, that steady heat, which glows,And with peculiar fixedness, resists
External cold: Nor, in the torrid Zone,Where Phoebus beams direct his fiercest ray,Is by the scorching atmosphere increasedTo morbid violence. By ExerciseThe stomach unopprest, digests, concocts,Assimilates, the generous chyle prepares,And feels again the necessary goadOf keenest appetite. That balance niceWith which health corresponds, of part to part,Of muscles to their due antagonists,Fluids to solids, to themselves, the justMixture, proportion, influence, strength of all;Even th' invisible ethereal stream,As vigorous, or weak, condensed, or rare,Sensation, passion, intellect, nay more,Virtue, and vice, on Exercise depend.KNOW it's advantage then; nor judge thy ChildWith this profusion of activityEndow'd in vain. For Nature rules within,Sage tutoress, and he now will soon acquire
By her instinctive precepts more than yearsOf labouring education can impart,So She be not in froward mood opposed,Or not unseconded by thee. Behold,And aid her movements, let him see and smell,Hear, taste, and touch all objects at his will.So the deceptive senses shall be fix'd;So early repetition shall bestowThat just discrimination, that acutePerceptive swiftness, which in future lifeSeems instantaneous and intuitive,Innate, and unpossest by second means.NOR as with limbs more firm He treads, impedeHis restless ardour, his inquisitiveAnd eager curiosity, which learns,Approaching nigh, the varied form of things,Their distance, situation, what resists,Or yields, th' innocuous, and replete with harm.Excite, impell him forward; and when MindNow beams apparent, and the flexile tongue,
By imitation, and habitual use,Can utter sounds articulate, the namesOf every object teach him to repeat;Add daily to his store of imagesSimple, and unabstracted; let him walkOr run the verdant fields and lawns along,Nor Thou disdain t' attend him, and point outAs giddy apprehension can receive,Or roving fancy lists, each herb, and tree,Mountain, and stream, and mineral, the birdsWhich skim the liquid air, or from the brakePour their sweet voices, herds, and bleating flocks,Insects on wing, or on the lowly ground.With him the nimble grashopper pursue,And chace the gawdy butterfly; or striveTo catch the variegated bow which plantsIt's base on earth, now near, but soon removedTo distant hills; or bid him mark the SunRefulgent shining; or the clouds diverse;At eve, the silver moon, crescent, or full;And every star whose radiance decks the sky.THUS shalt Thou see with pleasure on his cheekHealth's genial hue, his limbs proportion'd just,And beauteous, as of yore the little LovesIn Paphos, and Idalia, or as stillWarm from Albano's magic touch they breathe;Sportive as Zephyr, agile as the SonOf Maia, when his infant hand deceivedApollo's piercing sight, and stole his lyre.THUS Reason's structure shalt Thou help to form,Laying the sure foundation, and avoidTheir error, who the memory haply loadWith numerous words, and think their Child endow'dWith parts prodigious, should He get by roteSonorous trifles, useless, and to himIncomprehensible; debarr'd meanwhileFrom action, which invigorates the frame,And every curious sense directs to things,Momentous, and substantial, understoodAt once, or by spontaneous efforts stamp'dOn the sensorium, ne'er to be erased.REJECT their error. Nor should strength of NerveTo thy ill-fortuned Offspring be denied,Should e'en his limbs more tardily performTheir office, and distortedly relaxt,Trembling sustain their burthen; heed the voiceOf prejudice, or foolish tenderness,Which, nature's power unknown, would recommendForbearance, and each slight exertion dread.Rather endeavour by repeated useTo brace the fibres; Exercise can stringThe slacken'd muscles, which their native toneShall reassume, and conquer by degreesHated deformity. Nor, should a causeObscure, and singular, as such may beWithhold Him from th' assiduous playfulnessWhich Health and Nature love; indulge th' inertAnd heavy disposition; chide, invite,Force Him to move; lest sullen apathy,And stupor, the phlegmatic Habit's curse,To their devoted victim cling thro life.WITHOUT design, the lawns, and verdant fields,We introduced not; mid the rural hauntsWas placed the tender nurseling; and from thenceIf possible, for many a rolling yearLet nothing tempt thee with thy charge to seekThe baneful town. The country boasts aloneUntainted gales; the Joys, and frolic SportsHere revel; Temperance here awhile defiesEncroaching Luxury, and beneath it's shadesPrimeval, lingers Innocence of soul,And cherub-wing'd Simplicity. Here dwellsTh' unvitiated Muse, and thro the glade,By Alphin's willow'd margin, or beneathHis lofty elms, or mid his apple grovesThick blossoming, tunes th' elegiac strain,Or meditates, as now, th' instructive lay:Escaped from slavery, from the din of fools,From envy, and deceit, the treacherous crew,Who worse than fever or the pestilenceInfect the city's mansions; here intentTo meet Hygeia, and with her invert
The garden mould, copartner of her toil,Or raise the drooping flower, or from the treePrune it's luxuriant branches; or ascendWith her the swelling hill, or urge the steedAcross the neighbouring down, or bait the hook,And tempt th' unwary native of the stream.Oh! Thou Propitious Power! tho long exiled,The Muse hath met thee here! Whence easier springTh' ideas from their secret source, aroundFancy once more her fairy visions spreads.Light is the destined task, melodious airsInspire the bowers, and softer numbers breathe.IF Sickness enter not the rural dells,Or vanquisht by the purer atmosphereGive place to radiant health; consider wellWhat desperate ills thy Children may eludeHere educated, in whose veins yet flowsUnsullied ichor, by the steams which rise,Mortal, and gross, in the throng'd city's boundsUnchanged. Nor regulate with anxious zeal
Their pastimes and excursions, let them bend,As tutor'd from within, each pliant limb,Each mode of varied exercise essay,Enjoy their animation, and the stingOf innate sprightliness. Nor let them shunAccustomed thus, the summer's noonday heat,Or winter's freezing sky. Th' InhabitantsOf every region are by nature aptIt's warmth, or cold to bear, it's shifting winds,And quick vicissitudes: in frigid climesStill more alert, and stimulated moreTo necessary action. Oh! forewarn'd,Thy Children in the stifling dome, howe'erGrateful to thee, include not; and misledBy phantoms of imaginary harm,Superfluous vestments, tho defensive deem'd,Wrap not around them. So their vital powersTo danger unobnoxious, shall repellAll immature assaults; their nerves robustEscape the morbid tenderness of thine,Source of unnumber'd ailments; whence the mind
Itself at length unhing'd, is timid, weak,Irresolute, and to sensations doom'd,Which tho they must exist, can scarce be borne.OF polisht idleness which shrinks from toil,And cautious trembles at th' external blast,This is the sad result. While all the TribesUncultivated, whether in the wildsCanadian, or Brazilian, on the steepOf Caucasus, in Africa, or Ind,In the Malayan Isles, or those late seenBy Him, illustrious Chief whose timeless fateBritannia mourns, and shall forever mourn,Whate'er erroneous customs they possess,Howe'er productive of peculiar ills,From this at least are free, this languor wan,These nervous horrors which o'erwhelm the soul.But from activity, from open skies,And the lustration of pellucid streams,Unmoved support each accident of life,
Cold, hunger, thirst, and pain; nay dauntless meet,And cheerfully resign'd, the stroke of death.THUS too of old upon Eurota's banks,Or in the martial field near Tiber's waves,From hardy childhood, Lacedaemon saw,And Rome majestic, those intrepid bands,Which taught the sons of haughty Greece to stoop,Or subjected the world. To labour train'dFrom early years, thus, undebauch'd by courts,And softening indolence, in glory's pageEnroll'd, and with her laurels deckt, have shonePrinces, and Heirs of Empire. Thus, advancedFrom Persia's borders, unrelaxt, and brave,Cyrus, whom Babylonia's walls in vainResisted, and the Myriads which obey'dLydia's enervate Monarch, while his crownHe slavishly survived, and baser stillSurvived his liberty. Thus, mid the rocksOf Bearn, as lived the youthful Peasant Race,From them unknown, but by his royal mien,
With feet unfandall'd, and uncover'd head,Henry, the future Pride of France, was raisedBy true maternal virtue. Hence He quell'dIberia's new Geryon; hence, the LeagueThat factious Hydra gored with many a wound,And finally subdued: hence, graced his throne;And peace and plenty thro his realms diffused.LET then the sturdy Boy unlimitedFollow the bent of nature; nor too soonEnslave thy Daughter; let her limbs possessTheir utmost freedom to th' extremest vergeWhich custom will permit. The lengthen'd walk,The more delightful ride, the mazy danceWhose rapid evolutions ever please,These, fashion, rigid decency allow,Whate'er her age: and if each day pursuedIn regular succession, will createThat mode of happy texture, which attractsThe Lover's eye desiring; where the bloodSpeaks in the mantling cheek, but unsuffused
With coarse and vulgar crimson; where the frameIs healthy, not robust, and elegant,Not delicately fragile. Purer minds,And gentler manners Fancy here beholds,By peevishness untinctured, undisturb'dBy malice and suspicion; nor perchanceViews with illuded eye. For much the SoulDepends on her Companion. ExerciseToo far impell'd, abnormous, and for yearsContinued, renders dense the nervous tide,Or to the seat of thought at length impartsIdeot rigidity. Th' effects of AgeIntemperate toil can prematurely bringOn the worn frame, and sad untimely death.While Idleness relaxing every nerveThe mobile fluid is deranged by strokesOf slightest force, nor life is worth the name.WHAT then do We advise? At first intentOn the corporeal organs, Nature strivesT' unfold, to strengthen them; and calls in aid
Their own endeavours, restless, and untamed.In her more simple state, by keen desireOf food the loco-motive powers are roused;The Savage else inactively reclinesIn his low shed, or underneath the palm,Or spreading cedar, if not urged to war,And it's impetuous deeds, by hot revenge:Superiour swiftness and superiour strengthHis highest excellence, and only boast,The soul neglected, and to him unknownIt's finer feelings, and extatic joys.BUT in those climes where polity hath smooth'dOur innate roughness, where humanely taught,By wholesome laws conjoin'd, by th' intercourseOf liberal manners, and th' incircling chainOf Arts and Commerce, there the facultiesOf nobler birth are prized; the general-wealDefends each individual, who less heeds,Or values strength, except as far as healthAsks his attention; nor the body sole,
But mind, while gather the successive years,Parental notice claims. When this expands,Controul too fervid action, regulateIt's wilder efforts. Social life requiresThe head considerate, and the labouring hand,Business and speculation, study deep,And enterprise which laughs at danger's frown,Tost on the stormy billows, or engagedIn fighting fields. Whate'er his lot, adaptThy Child to vigorous deeds, or strenuous thought.Let Exercise and Books with mutual swayDivide his time well-govern'd. Who alonePursues the hare, the fox, and bounding stag,Or pores unceasing on the mouldy page,Equal contempt and blame deserves. Nor failIf totally their charms engross the soul,Acute Philosophy, or e'en the MuseWith all her softer beauties, to contractThe span of life, to fill that span minuteWith languor, discontent, disease, and pain.ERE We conclude, this added verse receive,From Greece derived; for as of late immerstIn rapturous thought, Memory it's Chiefs pourtray'dIt's Sages, Patriots, Bards, Apollo's SelfAppear'd, or in my day-dream seem'd t' appear.With Him the car I press'd, which swiftly flewO'er continents, and seas; not swifter rush'dThe trident-bearing God to Simois' plains,When under his immortal feet the woodsUmbrageous, and extensive mountains shook.We gain'd Boeotia, where arose the cliffsOf Helicon, th' impurpled lawn I trod,And to it's top beyond my feeble ken,Ascended my Conductor, where He join'dTh' expectant choir, whose harmony methoughtFar distant struck my ear. But on a bankWith lotus and with hyacinth o'erspreadReclined th' Ascraean Poet, Him I knew,For by his side was placed the verdant branchOf scepter'd laurel, which the Muses erstWith their own hands bestow'd, and bad him sing
Their high descent, and all th' ethereal Race.His sheep were scatter'd round, and many Swains,And many Virgins with attentive earImbibed his flowing numbers, with the throngI mingled, and regretting that so lateMy footsteps had arrived, for now his strainsWere well-nigh finisht, and the sun declinedT'ward ocean's bed, with deep respectful aweHeard his last notes, while thus the Master sung."His anger ceased; for on the rocks which boundThe solid earth, with adamantine chainsBraced firm, Prometheus groan'd, while on his preyThe screaming eagle darted from above.And Epimetheus too of vacant soulHad as a Bride received the treacherous MaidVulcan's alluring work, with graces fraughtCelestial, but diffusing evils dire.When now the sovereign Father bade conveneThe subject Powers; soft pity fill'd his breastFor new-created Man; on golden thrones,
They sate in order due; He thus address'dTh' assembled Deities. Ye Sons of Heaven!Who on Olympus dwell, or ocean's wavesInform, or o'er the streams prefide, or hauntThe woods, and forests! with avengement justThe Traitor is exiled, who first prefumedOur living fire to steal, who expiates nowHis guilt, and stretch'd upon the Scythian cragsHorrific, lies exposed to pieroing winds,Fierce-driving rain, and snow, or beating hail,Which with unmitigable violenceAssault his desolate abode. Nor failsOur ravenous Bird at early morn to seekHis nightly-growing feast. Such punishmentFrom us He merited; nor have we sparedHis favour'd mortals, with Pandora's giftsEnchanted, by her blandishments subdued.But them We now with kinder eye behold,Ill-form'd to last, and verging to decayHourly; no doubt with skill and care composed,Worthy their Author, and with Heaven's own flame
Instinct, from our ethereal dome procuredBy fraudful stratagem; yet weak to bearThe changeful elements, diseases fell,And accidental ills, a numerous train;Too exquisitely wrought, and destined soonAgain to mingle with their kindred clay,Unless their fate some means yet unreveal'dAwhile protract; t'ward them my wrath relents,Not of themselves, from their own previous willsOriginated, and to transient lifeFrom dust upraised. To you the means I leaveImmortal Powers. Who wishes to preserveThe race terrestrial, hapless, and forlorn,From speedy dissolution, may explainFree, and unblamed the dictates of his heart."HE spoke. Then Pallas with attentive eye,Smiling, beheld the Deities around,Or pondering silent, or consulting deep.Smiling She sate; but graceful from her throneAt length arose, and thro th' effulgent hall,
Proceeding o'er the jasper pavement, soughtThe door high-arch'd, whose valves of solid goldSpontaneous open'd; ere again they closed,The blue-eyed Maid return'd, and by the handLed in the prime of youth, and blooming charms,A Nymph of heavenly mien, and as it seem'dA sister Goddess. On her cheeks was spreadThe glowing hue of Hebe; waving hungAnd loose her raven locks, but just confined;Her robe succinct a golden clasp upheldBaring the knee: Not languishingly softLike Venus in her gait, nor rivallingMajestic Juno; but in all her limbsDwelt symmetry divine, activity,And sparkling ardour; while her hand sustain'dA spear, too light for battles dire, in whichMars wields his massy javelin, but to featsOf mimic war adapted, or to wageThe Sylvan conflict. To the feet of JoveLed on, th' assembled Powers at once survey'dHer virgin Form with wonder and desire,
As from her breath perfumes, and from her hairDropp'd fragrant roses. Then Minerva paused,And thus began. O Father! see with thineHow all my thoughts accord. The means I bringThy destined aim to perfect; from their fateSuddenly threatening hapless Man to save,And bless with length of days: by this my work,This beauteous Nymph, whom I with plastic handIn emulation of Vulcanian skill,Or Promethean, fashion'd; not of earth,Or fire, like their productions, but of pureAnd elemental aether; nor by TheeForbidden, or with anger now survey'd.Her name Gymnasia, and in future times,And regions yet by mortal feet untrod,Health-giving Exercise. For she the raceOf Men shall urge t' exertion and to toil,Snatch from Pandora's arms the tender Babe,String his young nerves, and thro th' eventful scenesOf chequer'd life support him, scattering wideThe mists of torpid indolence, the worst
Of all the plagues, which in the fatal boxWere stored, whose sweetness poisons, and the frameWeak of itself, to double weakness dooms."SHE said. The Power superiour, with a smileApproved her wisdom, with a smile that cheer'dHeaven, earth, and seas; viewing the lovely NymphMoulded by her, and by her skill adorn'd,The stedfast Friend, and Guardian of Mankind."THEY thro the yielding air with speedy flightDescended, hasting to the Nether World;With acclamations loud, Olympus rang."END OF THE FIFTH BOOK.INFANCY, A DIDACTIC POEM. BOOK VI.ARGUMENT.Address to Dr Milman.—The Author declines treating particularly of the Diseases of Children.—The treatment of Diseases in general, cannot be taught to the Vulgar; nor could those of Children be contained in a work like this; much less could the skill and judgment be imparted necessary for the administration of Remedies.—False notion, because Children cannot describe their feelings, that the seats and causes of their Diseases are therefore unknown.—Diseases of Children not so simple as Some have imagined.—The Causes also are many and various.—Necessity of applying for speedy assistance.—This, even should it be unsuccessful, will binder the remorse which might follow a different conduct.—The effects of this remorse exemplified in an Episode.—Inoculation.—Rise and progress of the Smallpox.—Introduction of Inoculation into Europe by Lady Mary Wortley Montague.—This duty inculcated.—Conclusion.BOOK THE SIXTH.TO thee, whom laudable Ambition fires,Surmounting every obstacle, to climbThe height of science, rivalling the fameOf Arbuthnot, or Garth, or learned Mead:With whom in life's gay morn my heart inwoveA bond of union, which no power but deathCan e'er untwine: whose warm, whose liberal voiceHath oft approved my strains, in this perchanceToo partial, yet humane, and in the songContemplating the Friend: This verse, to thee,MILMAN! as worthier of thy classic ear,I now devote; nor would I on thy timeSacred to public good, or studious thought,Intrude the futile levities of wit,Or useless elegance, howe'er refined.WITH prudence nursed, and by it's precepts formed,Thy Child, O Parent! haply will ascendUnhurt to manhood. Yet, events there are,Which not my lays can teach the means to shun,Nor thy assiduous caution can elude.For He is mortal, and to mortal illsProne from his birth. Each violent DiseaseThe human race invading, may be his:And some, confined, exert their baleful forceOn Infancy, and Childhood. What, thy care,What, rural scenes, what the pure lymph, and foodAptly supplied; what his own active powersIndulged, the frigid bath, and cleanliness,With regulation due of heat and cold,Can frustrate or prevent, and much they may,He will avoid. At least the shafts of DeathShall oft be blunted, Nature's vigorous armHer shield protending, while her faithful aidJoins with thy ardent wishes. Is thy mind,Anxious, and fond, with this unsatisfied?And dost thou ask the latent plagues to view
Skulking in ambush? know their different signs?Learn their Prognostics, fatal, or secure?And the resources which progressive TimeHath found, and liberal Practice can select?WHAT wilt Thou gain, so taught? Augmented fears,Doubled anxiety. In every lookIf slightly changed, in every wanton cry,Or sudden start, thy love solicitousThe feeds of dire disaster will perceive,And haste with needless remedies t' opposeA fancied mischief, till thy Infant feelsPerhaps thus often treated, real pain.Say, that Disease were fixt, and that our pageLay full before thee fraught with justest rules;Could'st thou with timid mind, and throbbing heart,Presume t' apply them? Would'st thou not, immerstIn hesitation, all attempts forego?If not, the tone, and bias of thy soulMistaking, We for such as thee ne'er strungThe lyre humane, nor e'er the lyre will string.YET, much the welfare of thy Child We prize;And doubtless, even from his natal hourBeginning, could in graphic order paintEvery distemper, each appropriate nameDisclose, their diverse symptoms and their cure.And when th' instructive plan We first essay'd,Imagination's inconsiderate eyeColleagued with Youth, this finish'd work beheld.But Judgment, render'd stronger by the lapseOf twice seven years, rejects the green design.A theme inelegant, for verse unfit,Tedious, and long, and barren, and to TheeOf little profit, nay with danger stored.A TASK like this, the Muse without regretLeaves to some Medicaster, who the quill,Dextrously wielding, aims at vulgar praise.We know the failure of Generic marksEmploy'd on Species; near the bed of painWe know what nice distinction is required,What accurate serenity of thought,
What sedulous attention, to collectEach circumstance minute; and from the traitsCommingled and fictitious, to detachWhat suits peculiar natures, and the turnsOf endless and immense Varieties.WOULD then the Mother, would the wary Nurse,(If such there be) from so disturbed a fount,To them disturbed, it's muddy waters draw?And sport with human life? Not thus reproach'dShall flow my numbers, which the hand of rashOr doating Ignorance shall ne'er supplyWith poison. Never will I stoop to winThe Multitude's applause by deeds or wordsWhich candour must despise. Nor e'en in songReflections cast on others, that on meMay light the praise of fools; tho plansibleEach note appeared, and for the common goodIntended solely: Much less with abuseDegrade the very Art I once profess'd.For conscious of the toil it's practice claims,
Th' inquietude, the watchful nights, the daysTo thought intense devote, when jovial MirthHolds it's nocturnal orgies, and the voiceOf empty Vanity is heard at noon,Tho far beneath th' illustrious Great, I knewWhat form'd their sterling worth, and placed them highAbove the selfish, mean, Empiric race.SUCH were the Sages of th' Asclepian line;Thus, from the Coan, to th' incipient ageOf Boerhaave, lived the Prime of every school:Thus Sydenham, over every school Supreme;Such Huxham lately ran his course of fame.While GLASS with evening brightness still adornsThe western sky, and proves not yet extinctThe true, the genuine Hippocratic beams.Patient t' observe, They unremitting, scann'dThe book of Nature, while their souls enlargedTook in, and added to their proper storeAll past experience, methodized, and clear.How vain their labour! if a tract compiled
By some assuming, specious shallow Scribe,Could teach th' inferior orders of MankindWith strict discernment thro the tangled mazeOf it's progressive symptoms, to conductEach dangerous Malady, it's cause unveil,And each adapted remedy prepare:Could these my strains embrace the various ailsInfesting Childhood, to thine eyes displayThe various antidotes, and give that soundUnerring judgment, which alone acquiredBy use and contemplation, can insureThe proper time of trial, can adviseWith confidence, and justify the deed.YET, what We may, what nor the Muse forbids,Nor our own sense condemns, is freely thine.IF from the Mother's bosom We removeThose false opinions which her gentle soulUnwittingly possess; if we describeThe limits of her care, and when t' invoke
Superior Wisdom's aid; if on her mindSome duties we impress; and tyrant fear,And more tyrannic superstition driveFar from her dwelling, not in vain We write:And many a fell disease o'ercome, her Sons,Her Daughters shall hereafter bless the dayWhich brought these well-meant numbers to her ear.BECAUSE the Child, with reason unendow'dAnd power of speech, by words t' express his griefNature permits not; some believe the sourceOf anguish and affliction is conceal'dFrom every eye, and deem assistance vain.Or to the Nurse, or vaunting Midwife trust,Who cases manifold and similarHave oft beheld, and never fail'd to cure:For Each her Nostrum boasts; if harmless this,And trifling, it were well, did not the wingOf Time speed fast th' irrevocable hourOf wisht redress. But frequently the drugThey praise, the cordial drops are fraught with death,
Hurrying convulsions on of direst kind;Or with narcotic venom strong imbued,Plunging their Patient in eternal sleep.YET, Nature, in thy Child, tho not in words,Speaks plain to those who in her language verstJustly interpret. Are the different tonesOf woe, unfaithful sounds? Can He, whose sightHath traced the various muscles in their course,When irritated in the different limbs,Retracted, or extended, or supine,Fix no conclusions on the seat of pain?Is it of no avail to mark the breath,How drawn? the face? the motions of the eye?The salient pulse? th' eruptions on the skin?The skin itself, constricted, or relaxt?The mode of sleep? of watching? heat? and thirst?From which, and numerous traits beside, arranged,Combined, abstracted, and maturely weigh'd,Judgment it's practice forms? Are charactersLike these, which ask the nice-decyphering soul,
Intelligible to the Beldames OldWho wrapt in darkness, utter prophesiesAnd lying oracles, which cheat the ear,Or follow'd, to destruction lead the way?Oh! may good Angels, kindling in thy breastThe lamp of reason, guard thee from their snares!Blind Guides, assiduous to deceive the Blind.TRUTHS partially adopted oft admitIngressive Error. Children are presumed,As fresh from Nature's hand, with maladiesOf simpler kind to labour, than the frameOf grosser Age. Say, this belief were true?A general rule? If simpler than they areHence treated, still we cannot but decryTh' unsound opinion which for all alikeOne favourite mode of practice recommends.If just the notion, Aesculapius' SonMight as a vain intruder be dismiss'd,The Mother could supply his place unblamed.But, (nor with idle terrors do we seek
To wound affection) from experience taught,We know what medicines, different in effect,And opposite, the varying symptoms claim.Antiphlogistics which the vital heatIncreased, depress; and Cardiacs which excite;And Opiate Sedatives, in vulgar handsPernicious as the deadly nightshade's juice.And Drastics harsh, which utmost skill alone,And wise discretion, when the moment calls,Should dare advise. Th' uncomprehensive Mind,Or prejudiced, or wishing to reposeIn inactivity, is likewise proneTo simplify the causes, and accuseThat which perhaps exists not, but which reignsAs it conjectures, eminent o'er all.THE wild delusions which this source affords,With silent scorn or pity hath the MuseOften attested. The luxuriant glands,In Infants stiled of disproportion'd size,And the too copious fluids they secern,
Or tough and viscid, Some alone condemn.As if these glands by nature were ordain'dSo large without design, or worse, to proveThe cisterns of disease. AciditySome only blame; and some, the sting severeOf acrimonious humours. These accuseThe noisome worm, however hid from fight.Those, as exciting fever, reprobateNought but the growing teeth. Repletion, Some.While Others dreadful fits survey within,Or e'en pretend to trace them in the smileOf downy sleep. Nor Women solely err.The Pedant has his whims; and He, the lightFantastic Form, who superficial skimsThe froth of science, yet would fain appearMost intimate in it's profoundest depths,Nor a phaenomenon beholds, to which,Like the first Man, intuitively wise,He cannot give a name. What strange conceitsHave not Philosophers embraced? IntentThe principles of Galen to defend?
Or to deduce from chymic elementsRecondite causes? Or the line applyAnd mathematic rule, to buildings raisedOn mere imaginary ground? Or searchThe moon, and aspects of the distant stars?While Some, from animated Beings, thickDiffused thro space, invisibly minute,Have every ill derived, tormenting Man.LET All who will, enjoy their pleasing dreams,So human life be safe; and TheoryHeld in firm durance, never guide the penWhen sickness needs assistance. But, of thisBe sure, O Parent! to thy Children flowFrom numerous causes, which would tire thy ear,And pass the stated limits of our verse,Their diverse ails; tho not perhaps like UsSubject to putrid ferments, yet from themNot wholly free, nor from the power of cold,Of sultry heat, of humid air, and dry,And fell Contagion, whose resistless aim
If placed within it's reach, no Wight can shunOf mortal mould, nor e'er escape the bane,Unless around her favourites Nature castImpenetrable mail, no work of art.SHALL then by fear impeded, None attemptTo rescue Childhood from distress and pain,But those, by long and toilsome study taught,T' investigate the cause, the symptoms scan,And judge what they portend? Th' impartial heartUnmoved by sordid lucre, by the goadOf mean self-interest, wishes to the RaceOf Infant Innocence, no worse a fate.But not to combat what the Muses Nine,And e'en the Delian God with all his power,Could never vanquish; and because the stepOf Paeon's Votary is not always near;Attend our strains. When the weak head declines,And the eye droops; when now th' inconstant cheekIs red, now pale; when fretful, restless, hot;The stomach and intestines discomposed,
And in their office changed; when the young springsOf life more quick or tardy seem to moveThan Nature wills; We would not to thy ChildForbid thee (tho We dare not recommend,Nor can approve the deed, unless by fateWidely sequester'd from th' experienced eye,Reason's sole plea;) to give a portion dueOf th' Indian root; or taught the quantityWith nice exactness, which his Age may claim,Some useful Antimonial; or, that mild,Insipid, light, absorbent, by it's nameMagnesia, better known, or join'd with thisMore strengthening Rhéum, from Siberian wilds,Or Turkey's regions brought. Here ends thy care.For now the transient obstacles o'ercome,Alacrity returns; or still He pines,Still his distemper gains increasing force.And if the cause should thus be deeply fixt,Thy efforts would be vain, perhaps unsafe,At least engend'ring danger by delay,And Danger often marches close by Death.HERE let thy love, thy conscience take th' alarm;Love for thy Child, and terror at the guiltOf dire infanticide. Perhaps the worstOf ills impends; Convulsion lurks unseen;Fever already riots in his veins;Or suffocation threatens to destroy.Trust not Thyself; trust not the babbling Hag;Let Fondness all alive, and light'ning round,Detect Her, as Ithuriel's spear the toad,Couch'd at the ear of Eve, with poison fill'd.YET shun despondence, cherish warmest hope,Seize fleet occasion ere it passes by,And call th' ingenious Leach, his happy skillShall to it's pristine health thy Babe restore,If all-o'erruling Providence permit.If not, to th' indefatigable MindTho learning all it's mysteries hath reveal'd,Tho judgment clear, and long experience joinTheir potent aid, A WARREN will be foil'd,A HEBERDEN, or BAKER, cannot save.
But Thou from every taint of guilt or blameArt free; thy duty is perform'd; tho poorThat solace is, which counsels, Be resign'd,Fetter the strong sensations, rapid-wing'd;And glean content from rectitude of thought.Who thus can lose the Darling of the eye?The little lively Cherub, who e'en nowBegins his voice to modulate, and lispThe half-form'd tale? Ah! wherefore was he given?So soon resumed, and snatch'd from cheerful day?That, Heaven best knows. Yet, if thou wilt, indulgeThy just emotions, give them ample scope;Recall each mimic gesture, every sound,Each look, when pleased, or wayward in his mood,He struck with inexpressive tendernessThe soul parental. With thy struggling heartThe Muse shall sympathise, shall add to thineCongenial notes sincere. But time shall healThe rankling wound, and soften by degrees,Nay, quite o'ercome reflection's sharpest pangs;Till Memory tracing to the fount of Grief
Views it at length unruffled, and beholdsThro the calm lymph, Woe's once detested form,Affectionately pensive, yet serene.THE Human Soul with fortitude can bear,Or with elastic energy expell,Or slowly certain, vanquish every ill,But dread remorse. The Self-accused descendLow in the scale, and abject, or they pineAfflicted, or amid the blaze of noonPerceive no change in the dark midnight gloomWhich reigns within; Despair stands scouling by,And sullen Madness crouches for his prey.OH! may thy Mind, whatever doom'd to feel,Whate'er of anguish, pain, or penury,Wounds of ingratitude, or slighted love,This worse than all, that famine, fire, or steel,This horrid Fiend avoiding, never shrinkBeneath his weight, by conscious thought condemn'd.Nor, may Evadne's melancholy fate
Be ever thine. What beauties could She boast!How fair, in virgin innocence! Her charmsPierced deep, for unaffected was the Maid,And justest education had improved,Not tortured Nature. Melody had choseHer voice for it's loved vehicle of sound.Tho mute, She spake, her eye had magic fire.Her shape, her gesture, every action beam'dExpressive elegance. Could the young heartOf Polydore resist her wondrous power?He strove not to resist, He heard, He saw,And all his melting soul was Her's alone.Nor did She view th' enamour'd Swain, or hearScornful the tender vows He breathed; for hisWas the smooth open front of candid truth,The modest cheek, the soft persuasive glanceOf true affection, and the sigh sincere.The lawns, the meads beheld them, and the grovesOf quivering alder, and the willows greenSkirting the mazy brook, nor e'er beheldHappier and purer Mortals; nor e'er caught
Amid their shades, or on their mossy banks,Notes more impassion'd from the Doric Muse,Than Polydore to his Evadne sung.THUS fixt immutably, thus rivettedBy strong attraction, not a Father's frown,(For his imagination had pourtray'dEvadne in the higher rank of pride,Of wealth, and pageantry;) not five long yearsOf absence could from either's heart eraseThe other's image. Yet again They met,Auspicious was the meeting; for the soulOf Age severe, now moved, resolved to blessThe constant Youth, and to his arms resignThe beauteous Maid. He bless'd the constant Youth;And to his arms the beauteous Maid resign'd.Fair shone the morn of their espousals, fairThe coming morn, and promised to the eyeOf raptured love, a train of prosperous days.OH Happiness! how exquisite!—how brief!Affliction is the lot of Man below:And often, Misery, when the soul of joyFlushes with transport, breathes a sudden airOf chilling frost, the genial warmth destroys,And florid bloom. One eve Evadne satAlone, in swift succession to her viewRose many a fairy prospect, but the lightWhich gilded them was Polydore's, the sunWas He, illuming, animating allThe forms of her creation. Even thenShe felt his warm embrace, and press'd She thoughtHis glowing cheek to her's; for him prepared,The table smiled; for him bright-beaming shoneThe rosy wine; the foot-steps of his steedShe heard in every gale. But him, alas!The living Polydore she never saw.That Steed had proved unfaithful to his trust,With mad'ning swiftness t'ward the gate He flew,While far behind his breathless Master lay.THE feelings of Evadne to describeWeak is the Muse, and nerveless are her strains.What can support her? Where exists the PowerWhich can detain her from the grave that holdsHer Lord in death? What, but the Babe which smilesUnconscious of his loss, as on her breast,Her nurturing breast, He hangs? For him She lives.For him sustains the load of grief, and strivesTo tear the rooted anguish from her mind.He is the charm which reconciles her thoughtsTo the loath'd world? for Polydore in himShe sees, in the dear pledge of amity:Stampt with his image, with his vital bloodInform'd, and breathing sweet his balmy breath.HATH not Misfortune spent her deadly shafts?Ill-starr'd Evadne! In thy Child appearThe symptoms of disease, and onward hastesImpetuous Fever. To a form like thine,A temper blameless, with emotions pure,Humane, and amiable, ah! why did Heaven
Refuse staid Judgment, firmness to resistError importunate, and strength to shunCredulity, which hears the Dotard's tale,And thinks it truth! Who taught thy Grandam hoarThe secrets of an art, to which the MindOf vigorous energy, and years of toil,Are scarcely equal? By what Demon urgedMalicious, with what evil Spirit fill'dOf self-conceit and folly, dares She hopeT' accomplish, what requires the searching eyeOf Genius and the labour'd skill of deepAnd accurate attention? On thy ChildShe looks, then proves her wisdom. First, the teethAre blamed, and charms are tried, and Nostrums given.Next, Fits internal, and her poisonous drugsShe brews like Circe. Then the noxious Worm;And Anthelmintics various She procures,And oft repeats the drench. Each different causeShe e'er has heard suggested, is accused,And every remedy She ever knew,Administer'd; while still, the last, her voice
Solemnly slow, declares will banish pain,And with miraculous and sudden forceRestore the suffering Babe; who lies meantimeOpprest with double woe, by his disease,And that pernicious treatment, which from plainAnd simple, has converted it at lengthTo mortal violence. Now, Nature yieldsReluctantly o'ercome. Evadne seesThe Victim of presumptuous Ignorance;Conviction flashes on her mind; She callsFor aid, too late. He dies; and with him diesHer Polydore again. She raves, She tearsHer flowing locks. Yet, passionate excessMay waste itself, and Peace once more return.It might return, as when She felt the pangsOf absent love, as when her heart was torn,Losing it's dearer portion. But the stingOf sharp reflection, by Herself impell'd,What hand shall e'er extract? Her delicate,And feeling mind, imagination-struck,Shrinks from existence; while by day, by night,
These sounds pervade her ear, "Thy Child is slain,And Thou wert an Accomplice." Horrid sounds!Inviting on his cloud, the dreary ShapeOf melancholy Madness. Oh! what notes,What different notes, utters Evadne now,Enfrenzied, and forlorn, from those which erstAmid their shades, or on their mossy banks,The groves responsive heard, the joyous grovesOf quivering alder, and the willows greenSkirting the mazy brook, those Doric notes,Which Polydore to his Evadne sung.TURN We from scenes like these, which o'er the soulOf weeping Sympathy diffuse a gloom,Yet, not unchasten'd by the milder rayOf self-acquitting thought, and firm intentTo shun the latent rocks of deep distress,By pious caution guided; from our themeNot thus abstracted, it's preceptive notesYet unrelinquishing, and sorrows mistsDispell'd, which o'er the breast of Innocence
Flit like a cloud across the summer sky;To happier mansions, objects of delight,And joyful prospects, turn! to where thy ChildHath, by Inoculation, overcomeThe Plague Variolous! As HerculesThe spotted Snakes defeating, transport flush'dAlcmena's glowing cheek, so over thineI see the kindled radiance. Whether bornIn Ethiopic wilds, or mid the sandsOf parch'd Arabia, or where spread the shoresGirding the Caspian; from his natal place,Pursuing Mahomet's wide-wasting arms,The Monster rush'd on Europe, pale dismay,Horror, and Death rapacious in his train.For many a Century, without controul,When ragid his fury, by pernicious skiesAroused, or propagated far and wideBy fell Contagion, He destroy'd Mankind.The Cities groan'd; The Matron o'er her BabeIn unavailing trance of anguish hung.The Lover offer'd up his fruitless vows,
And wearied Heaven importunately fond,To save the Beauty which his soul adored.The Babe, the Mother's self, became his prey;The Youth, and Virgin, sunk into the tomb.If life were granted, beauty was effaced;Each decent feature, tumid, and enlarged,Roughen'd, or dented with unseemly scars.MEDICINE was whelm'd with shame; the Roman pageWas silent, nor the Grecian could affordAn antidote for evils Grecia's SonsHad ne'er imagined. Rhazes wrote in vain;And even Sydenham's efforts had their bounds.For the cold lymph by Prejudice was shunn'd;And Sydenham, tho He oft by freer airTamed the devouring heat, and shook the throneOf learned Ignorance, declaring warAgainst it's regimen, adverse to life,And compounds teeming with destructive fire,Alexipharmic poisons; could not changeThe rank malignant nature of the Pest:
Which still, when favouring constitutions reign'dAnd in peculiar Habits, all his artBaffled, invincible; his art, beyondAll Mortals else, and only not divine.THE triumph was reserved for Female hands;Thine was the deed, accomplish'd MONTAGUE!What Physic ne'er conjectured, What describedBy Pylarini, by Timoni sketch'd,Seem'd to Philosophy an idle tale,Or curious only; She by patriot loveInspired, and England rising to her viewProved as a truth, and proved it on her Son.A manly Mind where reason dwelt supremeWas Her's the little terrors of her sexDespising, by maternal fondness sway'd,Yet bold, where confidence had stable grounds.How far superior to the turbann'd RaceWith whom She sojourn'd, scrupulous, and weak!YET, this is She, whom Pope's illiberal verseHath dared to censure with malicious spleen,And meanly-coward soul. Redoubled Bard!What hath thy satire, tho it often flowHappy, and poignant, with Horatian ease,What hath thy moral lay, tho pure, and just,And elegant, of profit e'er produced,Of high advantage to thy natal Land,Compared with her bequest? Thy numbers charmThe listening ear, and with thy polisht stileTaste is enamour'd; She hath been the causeOf heart-felt joy to thousands, thousands live,And still shall live thro her; thy song can pleaseNone but the Sons of Britain; or the Few,Of nice, and studious leisure; She unlock'dThe springs of satisfaction and delight,And with perennial comfort bless'd the World.LET Me then urge this duty; nor to fearOr superstition yielding, let thy ChildEncounter in his native shape the Fiend,
And brave his violence. For, whither, say,To what sequester'd haunt canst Thou retreat,Where He will not pursue? How vain thy flight!How sure thy victory, if as Art directAnd wise Experience, thou anticipateHis threaten'd blow! So when the Patriarch's armWas stretch'd to wound his Son, An Angel came,And saved the victim from impending death.GENTLE; and almost harmless is the baneBy Skill communicated, which regardsThe times and seasons, nor infects the Child,If to Dentition's wonted state arrived;For, ill the labouring frame can then endureAn added stimulus. Nor yet beforeThat period; lest to Epilepsy proneBy the contagious vapour raised, He quitSudden the precincts warm of light and life.This too the cold of winter bids Us shun,Potent the vessels to contract, increaseTheir tonic force, and in the system stir
Fierce inflammation. And the summer heat;By which all putrid ferments are sublimed,And render'd doubly fatal. These extremesAvoided, in the temperate months aloneLet every prudent Matron be resolvedT' obey the call of duty, and of love.Unless the dread contagion, thickening round,Impell them to neglect each guarded rule,Yielding by force to peril's just alarm.NEED We, in this our Aera, when mature,And vigorous, reason prospers, groundless fearsOppose by arguments? the groundless fearsOf fondness, or religion? In thy mindNo terror should, or can with justice dwell,But lest, as naturally seen, by ArtUnmodified, uncheck'd, the stern DiseaseShould thy young Charge assault. If He escape,His lot is fortunate. Assaulted thus,Oft, from an Hundred only, many die.From many Hundreds, None, or one perchance,
Of those inoculated. Why should thineBe the poor solitary One? If deathFollow a treatment, which can soothe the Pest,And meliorate it's nature, could his lifeBe granted to thy fervent prayer, when arm'd,And with it's proper rage it took the field?This be thy source of comfort. Nor believeThat Providence is tempted by the deed.From Providence flows reason to Mankind;And Reason teaches Us to fly from ill,And covet good. Th' invention, the success,Is the true warrant of approving Heaven.Who would not rather cross a shallow frith,When first the rising tide begins, than waitHemm'd in a nook, till with impetuous forceIt sweep Him from his station? Who refuseBy Franklin's pointed rod, to draw the streamOf lightning on their roofs, because the cloudMight harmless pass above? thus safe convey'd,In unterrific silence, to the ground.THO rare th' Examples now, and scatter'd, markTh' unhappy Beings, who from idle dread,Or weak maternal love, in Childhood's stateThis boon received not; and who sharing yetTh' hereditary feelings, want themselvesFirmness of soul th' omission to supply.Mark, where they pine in solitude, oppresstBy anxious thought; to whom Man's cheerful RaceAffords no joy; the voice of Music breathesIt's choral notes unheard; the stage displaysThe living manners, and th' assembly beamsWith sprightliness and elegance, in vain.The City, nay the Village bounds they fly,And shift from place to place, as from the packOf clamorous Hounds and Men, in wild affrightThe trembling Hare. Oh! never may thy Sons,Thy Daughters, thus be cursed! in early lifeBy thee from all these future horrors freed!The mirthful croud, with innocence of heartJoining well-pleased; the gay, the social hourNor shunning, nor desiring, but awhile
To soften care; or fit the soul for acts,By relaxation due, of nobler kind.Endow'd by Thee with comeliness, no traceOf this abhorr'd Distemper left behind,And all it's wonted ravages defied.FOR MONTAGUE again the verse prepare,And bring th' harmonious strain! Why thro the realmsOf Europe are not votive Statues placedHonouring their Benefactress? From the straitsOf Gades, south, to where the towers ascendOf famed Petropolis? Or, crossing wideTh' Atlantic foam, why in the new-found World,Which more to Her, than it's Discoverer, owes,Appears no structure sacred to her praise?Yet, shall Imagination rear the dome,And fix th' expressive marble. Hither come,Ye Nymphs, and Swains, with flowery garlands deck'dYour polisht foreheads; on the shaven greenWhich fronts the Temple, ply your nimble feet,The jocund dance inweaving! Hither come,
Ye Fauns and Dryads! Hither, glowing Love,And spotless Beauty! Youth, with radiant eye,And blooming Health! While underneath the beechOr oak, which waves it's consecrated shade,Humanity, and Wisdom, smiling viewThe festive Throng, mid whom the Graces play.And quitting their proud bowers, and lofty hill,The Muses utter notes divinely sweet,Such as of yore They sung, when GratitudeTuned to the Friends and Patrons of mankindThe genuine lyre, ennobled by it's theme.FINIS.
