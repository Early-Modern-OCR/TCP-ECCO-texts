XLIX.ODE FOR MUSIC.I.Recitative.HERE all thy active fires diffuse,Thou genuin British Muse;Hither descend from yonder orient sky,Cloth'd in thy heav'n-wove robe of harmony.Air I.Come, imperial queen of song;Come with all that free-born grace,Which lifts thee from the servile throng,Who meanly mimic thy majestic pace;That glance of dignity divine,Which speaks thee of celestial line;Proclaims thee inmate of the sky,Daughter of Jove and Liberty.II.Recitative.The elevated soul, who feelsThy awful impulse, walks the fragrant waysOf honest unpolluted praise:He with impartial justice dealsThe blooming chaplets of immortal lays:He flys above ambition's low carreer;And nobly thron'd in Truth's meridian sphere,Thence, with a bold and heav'n-directed aim,Full on fair Virtue's shrine he pours the rays of Fame.III.Air II.Goddess! thy piercing eye exploresThe radiant range of Beauty's stores,The steep ascent of pine-clad hills,The silver slope of falling rills;Catches each lively-colour'd grace,The crimson of the Wood-nymphs face,The verdure of the velvet lawn,The purple in the eastern dawn,Or all those tints, which rang'd in vivid glowMark the bold sweep of the celestial bow.IV.Recitative.But chief she lists her tuneful transports high,When to her intellectual eyeThe mental beauties rise in moral dignity:The sacred zeal for Freedom's cause,That fires the glowing Patriot's breast;The honest pride, that plumes the Hero's crest,When for his country's aid the steel he draws;Or that, the calm yet active heat,With which mild Genius warms the Sages heart,To lift fair Science to a loftier seat,Or stretch to ampler bounds the wide domain of art.Air III.These, the best blossoms of the virtuous mind,She culls with taste refin'd;From their ambrosial bloomWith bee-like skill she draws the rich perfume,And blends the sweets they all conveyIn the soft balm of her mellifluous lay.V.Recitative.Is there a clime, where all these beauties riseIn one collected radiance to her Eyes?
Is there a plain, whose genial soil inhalesGlory's invigorating gales,Her brightest beams where Emulation spreads,Her kindliest dews where Science sheds,Where ev'ry stream of Genius flows,Where ev'ry flower of Virtue glows?Thither the Muse exulting flies,There she loudly cries—Chorus I.All Hail, All hail,Majestic GRANTA! hail thy awful nameDear to the Muse, to Liberty, to Fame.VI.Recitative.You too illustrious Train, she greetsWho first in these inspiring seatsCaught the bright beams of that aetherial fire,Which now sublimely prompts you to aspireTo deeds of noblest note: whether to sheildYour country's liberties, your country's laws;Or in Religion's hallow'd causeTo hurl the shafts of reason, and to weildThose heav'nly-temper'd arms whose rapid forceArrests base Falshood in her impious course,And drives rebellious Vice indignant from the field.VII.Air IV.And now she tunes her plausive songTo you her sage domestic throng;Who here, at Learning's richest shrine,Dispence to each ingenuous youthThe treasures of immortal truth,And open Wisdom's golden mine.Recitative.Each youth inspir'd by your persuasive art,Clasps the dear form of virtue to his heart;And feels in his transported soulEnthusiastic raptures roll,Gen'rous as those the Sons of Cecrops caughtIn hoar Lycaeum's shades from Plato's fire-clad thought.VIII.Air V.O GRANTA! on thy happy plainStill may these Attic glories reign:Still mayst thou keep thy wonted stateIn unaffected grandeur great;Recitative.Great as at this illustrious hour,When HE, whom GEORGE's well-weigh'd choiceAnd ALBION's gen'ral voiceHave lifted to the fairest heights of pow'r,
When He appears, and deigns to shineThe leader of thy learned line;And bids the verdure of thy olive boughMid all his civic chaplets twine,And add fresh glories to his honor'd brow.IX.Air VI.Haste then, and amply o'er his headThe gracefull foliage spread;Meanwhile the Muse shall snatch the trump of Fame,And lift her swelling accents high,To tell the World that PELHAM's nameIs dear to Learning as to Liberty.Full Chorus.The Muse shall snatch the trump of Fame,And lift her swelling accents high,To tell the world that PELHAM's nameIs dear to Learning as to Liberty.FINIS.
