DODSLEY, in PALL-MALL.MDCCLXXXII.HYMN TO THE NAIADS.BY DR. AKENSIDEDr. Mark Akenside was born on the 9th of November, 1721, at Newcastle upon Tyne. His father Mark was a butcher of the Presbyterian Sect. He received the first part of his education at the grammar school of Newcastle, and was afterwards instructed by Mr. Wilson, who kept a private academy. Being intended for the office of a Dissenting minister, he was sent at the age of eighteen years to Edinburgh; but, altering his first design, he turned his application to the study of physick, which he afterwards continued at Leyden, where he took his degree of Doctor on the 16th of May, 1744. He first practised in his profession at Northampton, from whence he removed to Hampstead, and afterwards to London. He was chosen Fellow of the Royal Society; became a physician to St. Thomas's Hospital; was admitted by mandamus to the degree of Doctor of Physic in the university of Cambridge; and was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in London. Upon the Settlement of the Queen's household he was appointed one of the physicians to her Majesty. He died of a putrid fever June 23, 1770, and was buried at the church of St. James's, Westminster.. MDCCXLVI.ARGUMENT.The Nymphs who preside over springs and rivulets are addressed at day-break in honour of their several functions, and of the relations which they bear to the natural and to the moral world. Their origin is deduced from the first allegorical deities, or powers of nature; according to the doctrine of the old mythological poets, concerning the generation of the Gods and the rise of things. They are then successively considered, as giving motion to the air and exciting summer-breezes; as nourishing and beautifying the vegetable world; as contributing to the fulness of navigable rivers, and consequently to the maintenance of commerce, and by that means to the maritime part of military power. Next is represented their favourable influence upon health, when assisted by rural exercise; which introduces their connection with the art of physic, and the happy effects of mineral, medicinal springs. Lastly, they are celebrated for the friendship which the Muses bear them, and for the true inspiration which temperance only can receive; in opposition to the enthusiasm of the more licentious poets.HYMN TO THE NAIADS.O'ER yonder eastern hill the twilight throwsHer dusky mantle; and the God of day,With bright Astraea seated by his side,Waits yet to leave the ocean. Tarry, Nymphs,Ye Nymphs, ye blue-ey'd progeny of Thames,Who now the mazes of this rugged heathTrace with your fleeting steps; who all night longRepeat, amid the cool and tranquil air,Your lonely murmurs, tarry: and receiveMy offer'd lay. To pay you homage due,I leave the gates of sleep; nor shall my lyreToo far into the splendid hours of mornIngage your audience: my observant handShall close the strain ere any sultry beamApproach you. To your subterranean hauntsYe then may timely steal; to pace with careThe humid sands; to loosen from the soilThe bubbling sources; to direct the rillsTo meet in wider channels, or beneathSome grotto's dripping arch, at height of noonTo slumber, shelter'd from the burning heaven.Where shall my song begin, ye Nymphs? or end?Wide is your praise and copious—First of things,First of the lonely powers, ere Time arose,Were Love—Love—Elder than Chaos.] Hesiod, in his Theogony, gives a different account, and makes Chaos the eldest of beings; though he assigns to Love neither father nor superior; which circumstance is particularly mentioned by Phaedrus, in Plato's Banquet, as being observable not only in Hesiod, but in all other writers both in verse and prose: and on the same occasion he cites a line from Parmenides, in which Love is expressly styled the eldest of all the gods. Yet Aristophanes, in The Birds, affirms, that Chaos, and Night, and Erebus, and Tartarus, were first; and that Love was produced from an egg, which the sable-winged night deposited in the immense bosom of Erebus. But it must be observed, that the Love designed by this comic poet was always distinguished from the other, from that original and self-existent being the  or  of Plato, and meant only the  or second person of the old Grecian trinity; to whom is inscribed an hymn among those which pass under the name of Orpheus, where he is called Protogonos, or the first-begotten, is said to have been born of an egg, and is represented as the principal or origin of all these external appearances of nature. In the fragments of Orpheus, collected by Henry Stephens, he is named Phanes, the discoverer or discloser; who unfolded the ideas of the supreme intelligence, and exposed them to the perception of inferior beings in this visible frame of the world; as Macrobius, and Proclus, and Athenagoras, all agree to interpret the several passages of Orpheus, which they have preserved.But the Love designed in our text is the one self-existent and infinite mind, whom if the generality of ancient mythologists have not introduced or truly described in accounting for the production of the world and its appearances; yet, to a modern poet, it can be no objection that he hath ventured to differ from them in this particular; though, in other respects, he professeth to imitate their manner and conform to their opinions. For, in these great points of natural theology, they differ no less remarkably among themselves; and are perpetually confounding the philosophical relations of things with the traditionary circumstances of mythic history; upon which very account, Calsimachus, in his Hymn to Jupiter, declareth his dissent from them concerning even an article of the national creed; adding, that the ancient bards were by no means to be depended on. And yet in the exordium of the old Argonautic poem, ascribed to Orpheus, it is said, that Love, whom mortals in later times call Phanes, was the father of the eternally begotten Night; who is generally represented, by these mythological poets, as being herself the parent of all things; and who, in the Indigitamenta, or Orphic Hymns, is said to be the same with Cypris, or Love itself. Moreover, in the body of this Argonautic poem, where the personated Orpheus introduceth himself singing to his lyre in reply to Chiron, he celebrateth the obscure memory of Chaos, and the natures which it contained within itself in a state of perpetual vicissitude; how the heaven had its boundary determined; the generation of the earth; the depth of the ocean; and also the sapient Love, the most ancient, the self-sufficient; with all the beings which he produced when he separated one thing from another Which noble passage is more directly to Aristotle's purpose in the first book of his metaphysics than any of those which he has there quoted, to shew that the ancient poets and mythologists agreed with Empedocles, Anaxagoras and the other more sober philosophers, in that natural anticipation and common notion of mankind concerning the necessity of mind and reason to account for the connexion, motion, and good order of the world. For, though neither this poem, nor the hymns which pass under the same name, are, it should seem, the work of the real Orpheus; yet beyond all question they are very ancient. The hymns, more particularly, are allowed to be older than the invasion of Greece by Xerxes; and were probably a felt of public and solemn forms of devotion; as appears by a passage in one of them, which Demosthenes hath almost literally cited in his first oration against Aristogiton, as the saying of Orpheus, the founder of their most holy mysteries. On this account, they are of higher authority than any other mythological work now extant, the Theogony of Hesiod himself not excepted. The poetry of them is often extremely noble; and the mysterious air which prevails in them, together with its delightful impression upon the mind, cannot be better expressed than in that remarkable description with which they inspired the German edition Eschenbach, when he accidentally met with them at Leipsic: "Thesaurum me reperisse credidi," says he, & prosecto thesaurum reperi. Incredibile dictu quo me sacro horrore afflaverint indigitamenta ista deorum: nam et tempus ad illorum lectionem eligere cogebar, quod vel solum horrorem incutere animo potest, nocturnum; cum enim totam diem consumserim in contemplando urbis splendore, & in adeundis, quibus scatet urbs illa, viris doctis; sola nox restabat, quam Orpheo consecrare potui. In abyssum quendam mysteriorum venerandae antiquitatis descendere videbar, quotiescunque silente mundo, solis vigilantibus astris et luna,  istos hymnos ad manus sumsi: and Chaos Chaos.] The unformed, undigested mass of Moses and Plato; which Milton calls"The womb of nature." Love, the sire of FateLove, the sire of Fate.] Fate is the universal system of natural causes; the work of the Omnipotent Mind, or of Love: so Minudius Felix: Quid aliud est fatum, quam quod de unoquoque nostrum deus fatus est. So also Cicero, in The First Book on Divination: Fatum autem id appello, quod Graeci EIPMAPMENHN; id est, ordinem seriemque causarum, cum causa causae nexa rem ex se gignat—ex quo intelligitur, ut fatum sit non id quod superstitiose, sed id quod physice dicitur causa aeterna rerum. To the same purpose is the doctrine of Hierocles, in that excellent fragment concerning Providence and Destiny. As to the three Fates, or Destinies of the poets, they represented that part of the general system of natural causes which relates to man, and to other mortal beings: for so we are told in the hymn addressed to them among the Orphic Indigitamenta, where they are called the daughters of Night (or Love), and, contrary to the vulgar notion, are distinguished by the epithet of gentle, and tenderhearted. According to Hesiod, Theog. ver. 904, they were the daughers of Jupiter and Themis; but in the Orphic Hymn to Venus, or Love, that Goddess is directly stiled the mother of Necessity, and is represented, immediately after, as governing the three Destinies, and conducting the whole system of natural causes.;Elder than Chaos. Born of Fate was TimeBorn of Fate was Time.] Cronos, Saturn, or Time, was, according to Apollodorus, the son of Coelum and Tellus. But the author of the hymns gives it quite undisguised by mythological language, and calls him plainly the offspring of the earth and the starry heaven; that is, of Fate, as explained in the preceding note.,Who many sons Who many sons devour'd.] The known fable of Saturn devouring his children was certainly meant to imply the dissolution of natural bodies; which are produced and destroyed by Time. and many comely birthsDevour'd, relentless father: 'till the childOf Rhea The child of Rea.] Jupiter, so called by Pindar. drow him from the upper skyDrove him from the upper sky.] That Jupiter dethroned his father Saturn, is recorded by all the mythologists. Phurnutus, or Cornutus, the author of a little Greek treatise on the nature of the gods, informs us, that by Jupiter was meant the vegetable soul of the world, which restrained and prevented those uncertain alterations which Saturn, or Time, used formerly to cause in the mundane system.And quell'd his deadly might. Then social reign'dThen social reign'd.] Our mythology here supposeth, thát before the establishment of the vital, vegetative, plastic nature (represented by Jupiter), the four elements were in a variable and unsettled condition; but afterwards well-disposed and at peace among themselves. Tethys was the wife of the Ocean; Ops, or Rhea, the Earth; Vesta, the eldest daughter of Saturn, Fire; and the cloud-compeller, or , the Air; though he also represented the plastic principle of nature, as may be seen in the Orphic hymn inscribed to him.The kindred powers, Tethys, and reverend Ops,And spotless Vesta; while supreme of swayRemain'd the cloud-compeller. From the couchOf Tethys sprang the sedgy-crowned raceThe sedgy-crowned race.] The river-gods; who, according to Hesiod's Theogony, were the sons of Oceanus and Tethys.,Who from a thousand urns, o'er every clime,Send tribute to their parent; and from themAre ye, O NaiadsFrom them, are ye, O Naiads.] The descent of the Naiads is less certain than most points of the Greek mythology. Homer Odyss xiii. . Virgil, in the eighth book of the Aeneid, speaks as if the Nymphs, or Naiads, were the parents of the rivers, but in this he contradicts the testimony of Hesiod, and evidently departs from the orthodox system, which representeth several nymphs as retaining to every single river. On the other hand, Calimachus, who was very learned in all the school-divinity of those times, in his hymns to Delos, maketh Peneus, the great Thessalian river-god, the father of his nymphs: and Ovid, in the fourteenth book of his Metamorphoses, mentions the Naiads of Latium as the immediate daughters of the neighbouring river gods. Accordingly, the Naiads of particular rivers are occasionally, both by Ovid and Statius, called by a patronymic, from the name of the river to which they belong.: Arethusa fair,And tuneful Aganippe; that sweet name,Bandusia; that soft family which dweltWith Syrian DaphneSyrian Daphne.] The grove of Daphne in Syria, near Antioch, was famous for its delightful fountains.; and the honour'd tribesBelov'd of PaeonThe tribes belov'd by Paeon.] Mineral and medicinal springs. Paeon was the physician of the gods.. Listen to my strain,Daughters of Tethys: listen to your praise.You, Nymphs, the winged offspringThe winged offspring.] The Winds; who, according to Hesiod and Apollodorus, were the sons of Astraeus and Aurora., which of oldAurora to divine Astraeus bore,Owns, and your aid beseecheth. When the mightOf HyperionHyperion.] A son of Coelum and Tellus, and father of the Sun, who is thence called, by Pindar, Hyperionides. But Hyperíon is put by Homer in the same manner as here, for the Sun himself., from his noontide throne,Unbends their languid pinions, aid from youThey ask: Favonius and the mild South-westFrom you relief implore. Your sallying streamsYour sallying streams.] The state of the atmosphere with respect to rest and motion is, in several ways, affected by rivers and running streams; and that more especially in hot seasons; first, they destroy its equilibrium, by cooling those parts of it with which they are in contact; and, secondly, they communicate their own motion; and the air which is thus moved by them, being left heated, is of consequence more elastic than other parts of the atmosphere, and therefore fitter to preserve and to propagate that motion.Fresh vigour to their weary limbs impart.Again they fly, disporting from their meadHalf-ripen'd and the tender blades of corn,To sweep the noxious mildew; or dispelContagious steams, which oft the parched earthBreathes on her fainting sons.

Still with youPomona seeks to dwell: and o'er the lawns,And o'er the vale of Richmond, where with ThamesYe love to wander, Amalthea Amalthea.] The mother of the first Bacchus, whose birth and education was written, as Diodorus Siculus informs us, in the old Pelasgic character, by Thymoetes, grandson to Laomedon, and contemporary with Orpheus. Thymoetes had traveled over Libya to the country which borders on the western ocean; there he saw the island of Nysa, and learned from the inhabitants, that Ammon, king of Lybia, was married in former ages to Rhea, sister of Saturn and the Titans; that he afterwards fell in love with a beautiful virgin, whose name was Amalthea; had by her a son, and gave her posession of a neighbouring tract of land, wonderfully fertile; which in shape nearly resembling the horn of an ox, was thence called the Hesperian horn, and afterwards the horn of Amalthea; that, fearing the jealousy of Rhea, he concealed the young Bacchus, with his mother, in the island of Nysa; the beauty of which, Diodorus describes with great dignity and pomp of style. This fable is one of the noblest in all the ancient mythology, and seems to have made a particular impression on the imagination of Milton; the only modern poet (unless perhaps it be necessary to except Spenser) who, in these mysterious traditions of the poetic story, had a heart to feel, and words to express, the simple and solitary genius of antiquity. To raise the idea of his Paradise, he prefers it even to —"that Nysean isle"Girt by the river Triton, where old Cham"(Whom Gentiles Ammon call, and Libyan Jove)"Hid Amalthea, and her florid son,"Young Bacchus, from his stepdame Rhea's eye. poursWell-pleas'd the wealth of that Ammonian horn,Her dower; unmindful of the fragrant islesNysaean or Atlantic. Nor canst thou,(Albeit oft, ungrateful, thou dost mockThe beverage of the sober Naiad's urn,O Bromius, O Lenaean) nor canst thouDisown the powers whose bounty, ill repaid,With nectar feeds thy tendrils. Yet from me,Yet, blameless Nymphs, from my delighted lyre,Accept the rites your bounty well may claim;Nor heed the scoffings of the Edonian bandEdonian band.] The priestesses and other ministers of Bacchus; so called from Edonus, a mountain of Thrace, where his rites were celebrated..Far better praise awaits you. Thames, your sire,As down the verdant slope your duteous rillsDescend, the tribute stately Thames receives,Delighted; and your piety applauds;And bids his copious tide roll on secure,For faithful are his daughters; and with wordsAuspicious gratulates the bark which, nowHis banks forsaking, her adventurous wingsYields to the breeze, with Albion's happy giftsExtremest isles to bless. And oft at morn,When HermesWhen Hermes.] Hermes, or Mercury, was the patron of commerce; in which benevolent character he is addressed by the author of Indigitamenta, in these beautiful lines: ,., from Olympus bent o'er earthTo bear the words of Jove, on yonder hillStoops lightly-sailing; oft intent your springsHe views: and waving o'er some new-born streamHis blest pacific wand, "And yet," he cries,"Yet," cries the son of Maia, "though recluse"And silent be your stores, from you, fair Nymphs,"Flows wealth and kind society to men."By you my function and my honour'd name"Do I possess; while o'er the Boetic vale,"Or through the towers of Memphis, or the palms"By sacred Ganges water'd, I conduct"The English merchant: with the buxom fleece"Of fertile Ariconium while I clothe"Sarmatian kings; or to the household Gods"Of Syria, from the bleak Cornubian shore,"Dispense the mineral treasure Dispense the mineral treasure.] The merchants of Sidon and Tyre made frequent voyages to the coast of Cornwall, from whence they carried home great quantities of tin. which of old"Sidonian pilots sought, when this fair land"Was yet unconscious of those generous arts"Which wise Phoenicia from their native clime"Transplanted to a more indulgent heaven."Such are the words of Hermes: such the praise,O Naiads, which from tongues coelestial waitsYour bounteous deeds. From bounty issueth power:And those who, sedulous in prudent works,Relieve the wants of nature, Jove repaysWith generous wealth and his own seat on earth,Fit judgments to pronounce, and curb the mightOf wicked men. Your kind unfailing urnsNot vainly to the hospitable artsOf Hermes yield their store. For, O ye Nymphs,Hath he not won.] Mercury the patron of commerce, being so greatly dependent on the good offices of the Naiads, in return obtains for them the friendship of Minerva, the goddess of war: for military power, at least the naval part of it, hath constantly followed the establishment of trade; which exemplifies the preceding observation, that "from bounty issueth power."Hath he not won the unconquerable queenOf arms to court your friendship? You she ownsThe fair associates who extend her swayWide o'er the mighty deep; and grateful thingsOf you she uttereth, oft as from the shoreOf Thames, or Medway's vale, or the green banksOf Vecta, she her thundering navy leadsTo Calpe's Caipe—Cartabrian surge.] Gibraltar and the bay of Biscay. foaming channel, or the roughCantabrian coast; her auspices divineImparting to the senate and the princeOf Albion, to dismay barbaric kings,The Iberian, or the Celt.

Xerxes sawXerxes saw.] This circumstance is recorded in that passage, perhaps the most splendid among all the remains of ancient history, where Plutarch, in his "Life of Themistocles," describes the sea-fights of Artemisium and Salamis.:From Heracleum, on the mountain's heightThron'd in his golden car, he knew the signCoelestial; felt unrighteous hope forsakeHis faltering heart, and turn'd his face with shame.Hail, ye who share the stern Minerva's power;Who arm the hand of liberty for war;And give, in secret, the Britannic nameTo awe contending monarchs: yet benign,Yet mild of nature, to the works of peaceMore prone, and lenient of the many illsWhich wait on human life. Your gentle aidHygeia well can witness; she who saves,From poisonous cares and cups of pleasing bane,The wretch devoted to the entangling snaresOf Bacchus and of Comus. Him she leadsTo Cynthia's lonely haunts. To spread the toils,To beat the coverts, with the jovial hornAt dawn of day to summon the loud hounds,She calls the lingering sluggard from his dreams;And where his breast may drink the mountain breeze,And where the fervour of the sunny valeMay beat upon his brow, through devious pathsBeckons his rapid courser.

Near it were several fountains, said to be frequented by the Muses. Nysa, the other eminence of the same mountain, was dedicated to Bacchus., where with you they dwell:Where you their chafte companions they admitThrough all the hallow'd scene: where oft intent,And leaning o'er Castalia's mossy verge,They mark the cadence of your confluent urns,How tuneful, yielding gratefullest reposeTo their consorted measure: 'till again,With emulation all the sounding choir,And bright Apollo, leader of the song,Their voices through the liquid air exalt,And sweep their lofty strings: those aweful strings,That charm the minds of GodsCharm the minds of gods.] This whole passage, concerning the effects of sacred music among the gods, is taken from Pindar's first Pythian ede.: that fill the courtsOf wide Olympus with oblivion sweetOf evils, with immortal rest from cares;Assuage the terrours of the throne of Jove;And quench the formidable thunderboltOf unrelenting fire. With slacken'd wings,While now the solemn concert breathes around,Incumbent o'er the sceptre of his lord,Sleeps the stern eagle; by the number'd notes,Posses'd; and satiate with the melting tone:Sovereign of birds. The furious God of war,His darts forgetting and the rapid wheelsThat bear him vengeful o'er the embattled plain,Relents, and sooths his own fierce heart to ease,Unwonted ease. The fire of Gods and men,In that great moment of divine delight,Looks down on all that live; and whatsoe'erHe loves not, o'er the peopled earth, and o'erThe interminated ocean, he beholdsCurs'd with abhorrence by his doom severe,And troubled at the sound. Ye, Naiads, yeWith ravish'd ears the melody attendWorthy of sacred silence. But the slavesOf Bacchus with tempestuous clamours striveTo drown the heavenly strains; of highest Jove,Irreverent; and by mad presumption fir'dTheir own discordant raptures to advanceWith hostile emulation. Down they rushFrom Nysa's vine-impurpled cliff, the damesOf Thrace, the Satyrs, and the unruly Fauns,With old Silenus, through the midnight gloomTossing the torch impure, and high in airThe brandish'd Thyrsus, to the Phrygian pipe'sPhrygian pipe's.] The Phrygian music was fantastic and turbulent, and fit to excite disorderly passions.Shrill voice, and to the clashing cymbals, mix'dWith shrieks and frantic uproar, May the GodsFrom every unpolluted ear avertTheir orgies!

The immortal MuseTo your calm habitations, to the caveCorycian The cave Corycian.] Of this cave Pausanias, in his Tenth Book, gives the following description: Between Delphi and the eminences of Parnassus, is a road to the grotto of Corycium, which has its name from the nymph Corycia, and is by far the most remarkable which I have seen. One may walk a great way into it without a torch. It is of a considerable height, and hath several springs within it; and yet a much greater quantity of water distills from the shell and roof, so as to be continually dropping on the ground. The people round Parnassus hold it sacred to the Corycian nymphs and to Pan. or the Delphic mountDelphic mount.] Delphi, the seat and oracle of Apollo, had a mountainous and rocky situation on the skirts of Parnassus., will guideHis footsteps: and with your unsullied streamsHis lips will bathe: whether the eternal loreOf Themis, or the majesty of Jove,To mortals he reveal; or teach his lyreThe unenvied guerdon of the patriot's toils,In those unfading islands of the blest,Where Sacred bards abide. Hail, honour'd Nymphs;Thrice hail. For you the Cyrenaïc Cyrenaïc.] Cyrene was the native country of Callimachus, whose hymns are the most remarkable example of that mythological passion which is assumed in the preceding poem, and have always afforded particular pleasure to the author of it, by reason of the mysterious solemnity with which they affect the mind. On this account he was induced to attempt somewhat in the same manner; solely by way of exercise: the manner itself being now almost intirely abandoned in poetry. And as the meer genealogy, or the personal adventures of heathen gods, could have been but little interesting to a modern reader; it was therefore thought proper to select some convenient part of the history of nature, and to employ these ancient divinities as it is probable they were first employed; to wit, in personifying natural causes, and in representing the mutual agreement or opposition of the corporeal and moral powers of the world: which hath been accounted the very highest office of poetry. shell,Behold, I touch, revering.

Chian father's strainTo many a kind domestic train,Whose pious hearth, and genial bowl,Had cheer'd the reverend pilgrim's soul:When, every hospitable riteWith equal bounty to requite,He struck his magic strings;And pour'd spontaneous numbers forth,And seiz'd their ears with tales of ancient worth,And fill'd their musing hearts with vast heroic things.II. 2.Now oft, where happy spirits dwell,Where yet he tunes his charming shell,Oft near him, with applauding hands,The genius of his country stands.To listening gods he makes him known,That man divine, by whom were sownThe seeds of Graecian fame:Who first the race with freedom fir'd;From whom Lycurgus Sparta's sons inspir'dLycurgus the Lacedaemonian law-giver brought into Greece from Asia Minor the first complete copy of Homer's works.—At Plataea was fought the decisive battle between the Persian army and the united militia of Greece under Pausanias and Aristides.—Cimon the Athenian erected a trophy in Cyprus for two great victories gained on the same day over the Persians by sea and land. Diodorus Siculus has preserved the inscription which the Athenians affixed to the consecrated spoils' after this great success; in which it is very remarkable, that the greatness of the occasion has raised the manner of expression above the usual simplicity and modesty of all other ancient inscriptions. It is this: ........ The following translation is almost literal: Since first the sea from Asia's hostile coastDivided Europe, and the god of warAssail'd imperious cities; never yet,At once among the waves and on the shore,Hath such a labour been atchiev'd by menWho earth inhabit. They whose arms the MedesIn Cyprus felt pernicious, they, the same,Have won from skilful Tyre an hundred shipsCrouded with warriors. Asia groans, in bothHer hands sore smitten, by the might of war.;From whom Plataean palms and Cyprian trophies came.II. 3.O noblest, happiest age!When Aristides rul'd, and Cimon fought;When all the generous fruits of Homer's pageExulting PindarPindar was contemporary with Aristides and Cymon, in whom the glory of ancient Greece was at his height. When Xerxes invaded Greece, Pindar was true to the common interest of his country; though his fellow-citizens, the Thebans, had sold themselves to the Persian king. In one of his odes he expresses the great distress and anxiety of his mind, occasioned by the vast preparations of Xerxes against Greece. (Isthm, 8.) In another he celebrates the victories of Salamis, Plata, and Himera. (Pyth. 1.) It will be necessary to add two or three other particulars of his life, real or fabulous, in order to explain what follows in the next concerning him. First then, he was thought to be so great a favourite of Apollo, that the priests of that deity allotted him a constant share of their offerings. It was said of him, as of some other illustrious men, that at his birth a swarm of bees lighted on his lips, and fed him with their honey. It was also a tradition concerning him, that Pan was heard to recite his poetry, and seen dancing to one of his hymns on the mountains near Thebes. But a real historical fact in his life is, that the Thebans imposed a large fine upon him on account of the veneration which he expressed in his poems for that heroic spirit, shewn by the people of Athens in defence of the common liberty, which his own fellow-citizens had shamefully betrayed. And, as the argument of this ode implies, that great poetical talents, and high sentiments of liberty, do reciprocally produce and assist each other, so Pindar is perhaps the most exemplary proof of this connection, which occurs in history. The Thebans were remarkable, in general, for a slavish disposition through all the fortunes of their commonwealth; at the time of its ruin by Philip; and even in its best state, under the administration of Pelopidas and Epaminondas: and every one knows, they were no less remarkable for great dulness, and want of all genius. That Pindar should have equally distinguished himself from the rest of his fellow-citizens in both these respects seems somewhat extraordinary, and is scarce to be accounted for but by the preceding observation. saw to full perfection brought.O Pindar, oft shalt thou be hail'd of me:Not that Apollo fed thee from his shrine;Not that thy lips drank sweetness from the bee;Nor yet that, studious of thy notes divine,Pan danc'd their measure with the sylvan throng:But that thy songWas proud to unfoldWhat thy base rulers trembled to behold;Amid corrupted Thebes was proud to tellThe deeds of Athens and the Persian shame:Hence on thy head their impious vengeance fell.But thou, O faithful to thy fame,The Muse's law didst rightly know;That who would animate his lays,And other minds to virtue raise,Must feel his own with all her spirit glow.III. 1.Are there, approv'd of later times,Whose verse adorn'd a Octavius Caesar. tyrant's crimes?Who saw majestic Rome betray'd,And lent the imperial ruffian aid?Alas! not one polluted bard,No, not the strains that Mincius heard,Or Tibur's hills reply'd,Dare to the Muse's ear aspire;Save that, instructed by the Grecian lyre,With freedom's ancient notes their shameful task they hide.III. 2.Mark, how the dread Pantheon stands,Amid the domes of modern hands:Amid the toys of idle state,How simply, how severely great!Then turn, and, while each western climePresents her tuneful sons to Time,So mark thou Milton's name:And add, "Thus differs from the throng"The spirit which inform'd thy aweful song,"Which bade thy potent voice protect thy country's fame."III. 3.Yet hence barbaric zealHis memory with unholy rage pursues;While from these arduous cares of public wealShe bids each bard be gone, and rest him with his Muse.O fool! to think the man, whose ample mindMust grasp at all that yonder stars survey;Must join the noblest forms of every kind,The world's most perfect image to display,Can e'er his country's majesty behold,Unmov'd or cold!O fool! to deemThat He, whose thought must visit every theme,Whose heart must every strong emotion knowBy nature planted, or by fortune taught;That He, if haply some presumptuous foe,With false ignoble science fraught,Shall spurn at freedom's faithful band:That He, their dear defence will shun,Or hide their glories from the sun,Or deal their vengeance with a woman's handAlluding to his "Defence of the people of England" against Salmafius. See particularly the manner in which he himself speaks of that undertaking, in the introduction to his reply to Morus.!IV. 1.I care not that in Arno's plain,Or on the sportive banks of Seine,From public themes the Muse's quireContent with polish'd ease retire.Where priests the studious head command,Where tyrants bow the warlike handTo vile ambition's aim,Say, what can public themes afford,Save venal honours to an hateful lord,Reserv'd for angry heaven, and scorn'd of honest fame?IV. 2.But here, where freedom's equal throneTo all her valiant sons is known;Where all are conscious of her cares,And each the power, that rules him, shares;Here let the bard, whose dastard tongueLeaves public arguments unsung,Bid public praise farewel:Let him to fitter climes remove,Far from the heroe's and the patriot's love,And lull mysterious monks to slumber in their cell.IV. 3.O Hastings, not to allCan ruling heav'n the same endowments lend:Yet still doth nature to her offspring call,That to one general weal their different powers they bend,Unenvious. Thus alone, though strains divineInform the bosom of the Muse's son;Though with new honours the patrician's lineAdvance from age to age; yet thus aloneThey win the suffrage of impartial fame.The poet's nameHe best shall prove,Whose lays the soul with noblest passions move.But thee, O progeny of heroes old,Thee to severer toils thy fate requires:The fate which form'd thee in a chosen mould,The grateful country of thy sires,Thee to sublimer paths demand;Sublimer than thy sires could trace,Or thy own EDWARD Edward the Third; from whom descended Henry Hastings, third Earl of Huntingdon, by the daughter of the Duke of Clarence, brother to Edward the Fourth. teach his race,Though Gaul's proud genius sank beneath his hand.V. 1.From rich domains and subject farms,They led the rustic youth to arms;And kings their stern atchievements fear'd;While private strife their banners rear'd.But loftier scenes to thee are shown,Where empire's wide-establish'd throneNo private master fills:Where, long foretold, The People reigns:Where each a vassal's humble heart disdains;And judgeth what he sees; and, as he judgeth, wills.V. 2.Here be it thine to calm and guideThe swelling democratic tide;To watch the state's uncertain frame,And baffle faction's partial aim:But chiefly, with determin'd zeal,To quell that servile band, who kneelTo freedom's banish'd foes;That monster, which is daily foundExpert and bold thy country's peace to wound;Yet dreads to handle arms, nor manly counsel knows.V. 3.'Tis highest heaven's command,That guilty aims should sordid paths pursue:That what ensnares the heart should curb the hand,And virtue's worthless foes be false to glory to.But look on freedom. See, through every age,What labours, perils, griefs, hath she disdain'd!What arms, what regal pride, what priestly rage,Have her dread offspring conquer'd or sustain'd!For Albion well have conquer'd. Let the strainsOf happy swains,Which now resoundWhere Scarsdale's cliffs the swelling pastures bound,Bear witness. There, oft let the farmer hailThe sacred orchard which imbowers his gate,And shew to strangers passing down the vale,Where Candish, Booth, and Osborne sateAt Whittington, a village on the edge of Scarsdale in Derbyshire, the Earls of Devonshire and Danby, with the Lord Delamere, privately concerted the plan of the Revolution. The house at which they met is at present a farm-house; and the country people distinguish the room where they sat by the name of "the plotting parlour.";When bursting from their country's chain,Even in the midst of deadly harms,Of papal snares and lawless arms,They plann'd for freedom this her aweful reign.VI. 1.This reign, these laws, this publice care,Which Nassau gave us all to share,Had ne'er adorn'd the English name,Could fear have silenc'd freedom's claim.But fear in vain attempts to bindThose lofty efforts of the mindWhich social good inspires;Where men, for this, assault a throne,Each adds the common welfare to his own;And each unconquer'd heart the strength of all acquires.VI. 2.Say, was it thus, when late we view'dOur fields in civil blood imbrued?When fortune crown'd the barbarous host,And half the astonish'd isle was lost?Did one of all that vaunting train,Who dare affront a peaceful reign,Durst one in arms appear?Durst one in counsels pledge his life?Stake his luxurious fortunes in the strife?Or lend his boasted name his vagrant friends to cheer?VI. 3.Yet, HASTINGS, these are they,Who challenge to themselves thy country's love:The true; the constant: who alone can weighWhat glory should demand, or liberty approve!But let their works declare them. Thy free powers,The generous powers of thy prevailing mind,Not for the tasks of their confederate hours,Lewd brawls and lurking slander, were design'd.Be thou thy own approver. Honest praiseOft nobly swaysIngenuous youth:But, sought from cowards and the lying mouth,Praise is reproach. Eternal GOD aloneFor mortals fixeth that sublime award.He, from the faithful records of his throne,Bids the historian and the bardDispose of honour and of scorn;Discern the patriot from the slave;And write the good, the wise, the brave,For lessons to the multitude unborn.ODE To the Right Reverend BENJAMIN, Lord Bishop of WINCHESTERDr. Benjamin Hoadly, successively Bishop of Bangor, Hereford, Salisbury, and Winchester; a divine whose life was spent in a perpetual exertion of the noblest faculties to the noblest ends, the vindication of the religious and civil liberties of mankind in general, and of his country in particular.

'tis Nature pleads,Her ample volume opens on your view,The simple-minded swain, who running reads,Feels the glad truth, and is it hid from you?Look forth, and be convinc'd! Yon prospects wideTo Reason's ear how forcibly they speak,Compar'd with those how dull is letter'd Pride,And Austin's babbling Eloquence how weak!Temp'rance, not Abstinence, in every blissIs Man's true joy, and therefore Heaven's command:The wretch who riots thanks his God amiss:Who starves, rejects the bounties of his hand.Mark, while the Marne in yon full channel glides,How smooth his course, how Nature smiles around!But should impetuous torrents swell his tides,The fairy landskip sinks in oceans drown'd.Nor less disastrous, should his thrifty urnNeglected leave the once well-water'd land,To dreary wastes yon paradise would turn,Polluted ooze, or heaps of barren sand.ELEGY II. On the MAUSOLEUM It is now a garden belonging to Marchese di Corré. of AUGUSTUS. To the Right Honourable GEORGE BUSSY VILLIERS, Viscount VILLIERS, Son to the Earl of JERSEY. Written at ROME, 1756.AMID these mould'ring walls, this marble round,Where slept the Heroes of the Julian name,Say, shall we linger still in thought profound,And meditate the mournful paths to fame?What though no cypress shades, in funeral rows,No sculptur'd urns, the last records of Fate,O'er the shrunk terrace wave their baleful boughs,Or breathe in storied emblems of the great;Yet not with heedless eye will we surveyThe scene though chang'd, nor negligently tread;These variegated walks, however gay,Were once the silent mansions of the dead.In every shrub, in every flow'ret's bloomThat paints with different hues yon smiling plain,Some Hero's ashes issue from the tomb,And live a vegetative life again.For matter dies not as the Sages say,But shifts to other forms the pliant mass,When the free spirit quits its cumb'rous clay,And sees, beneath, the rolling Planets pass.Perhaps, my Villiers, for I sing to Thee,Perhaps, unknowing of the bloom it gives,In yon fair scion of Apollo's treeThe sacred dust of young Marcellus lives.Pluck not the leaf—'twere sacrilege to woundTh' ideal memory of so sweet a shade;In these sad seats an early grave he found,AndHe is said to be the first person buried in this monument. the first rites to gloomy Dis convey'd.Witness Quantos ille virûm magnam Mavortis ad urbemCampus aget gemitus! thou Field of Mars, that oft hadst knownHis youthful triumphs in the mimic war,Thou heard'st the heart-felt universal groanWhen o'er thy bosom roll'd the funeral car.Witness —Vel quae, Tyberine, videbisFunera, cum tumulum praeterlabere recentem!VIRG. thou Tuscan stream, where oft he glow'dIn sportive strugglings with th' opposing wave,Fast by the recent tomb thy waters flow'dWhile wept the wise, the virtuous, and the brave.O lost too soon!—yet why lament a fateBy thousands envied, and by Heaven approv'd?Rare is the boon to those of longer dateTo live, to die, admir'd, esteem'd, belov'd.Weak are our judgements, and our passions warm,And slowly dawns the radiant morn of truth,Our expectations hastily we form,And much we pardon to ingenuous youth.Too oft we satiate on th' applause we payTo rising Merit, and resume the Crown;Full many a blooming genius, snatch'd away,Has fall'n lamented who had liv'd unknown.For hard the task, O Villiers, to sustainTh' important burthen of an early fame;Each added day some added worth to gain,Prevent each wish, and answer every claim.Be thou Marcellus, with a length of days!But O remember, whatsoe'er thou art,The most exalted breath of human praiseTo please indeed must echo from the heart.Though thou be brave, be virtuous, and be wise,By all, like him, admir'd, esteem'd, belov'd,'Tis from within alone true Fame can rise,The only happy is the Self-approv'd.ELEGY III. To the Right Honourable GEORGE SIMON HARCOURT, Viscount NEWNHAM, Son to Earl HARCOURT. Written at ROME, 1756.YES, noble Youth, 'tis true; the softer arts,The sweetly-sounding string, and pencil's power,Have warm'd to rapture even heroic hearts,And taught the rude to wonder, and adore.For Beauty charms us, whether she appearsIn blended colours; or to soothing soundAttunes her voice; or fair proportion wearsIn yonder swelling dome's harmonious round.All, all she charms; but not alike to all'Tis given to revel in her blissful bower;Coercive ties, and Reason's powerful call,Bid some but taste the sweets, which some devour.When Nature govern'd, and when Man was young,Perhaps at will th' untutor'd Savage rov'd,Where waters murmur'd, and where clusters hungHe fed, and slept beneath the shade he lov'd.But since the Sage's more sagacious mind,By Heaven's permission, or by Heaven's command,To polish states his social laws assign'd,And general good on partial duties plann'd;Not for ourselves our vagrant steps we bendAs heedless Chance, or wanton Choice ordain;On various stations various tasks attend,And men are born to trifle or to reign.As chaunts the woodman whilst the Dryads weep,And falling forests fear th' uplifted blow,As chaunts the shepherd, while he tends his sheep,Or weaves to pliant forms the osier bough;To me 'tis given, whom Fortune loves to leadThrough humbler toils to life's sequester'd bowers,To me 'tis given to wake th' amusive reed,And sooth with song the solitary hours.But Thee superior soberer toils demand,Severer paths are thine of patriot fame;Thy birth, thy friends, thy king, thy native land,Have given thee honours, and have each their claim.Then nerve with fortitude thy feeling breastEach wish to combat, and each pain to bear;Spurn with disdain th' inglorious love of rest,Nor let the syren Ease approach thine ear.Beneath yon cypress shade's eternal greenSee prostrate Rome her wond'rous story tell,Mark how she rose the world's imperial queen,And tremble at the prospect how she fell!Not that my rigid precepts would requireA painful struggling with each adverse gale,Forbid thee listen to th' enchanting Lyre,Or turn thy steps from Fancy's flowery vale.Whate'er of Greece in sculptur'd brass survives,Whate'er of Rome in mould'ring arcs remains,Whate'er of Genius on the canvass lives,Or flows in polish'd verse, or airy strains,Be these thy leisure; to the chosen few,Who dare excel, thy fost'ring aid afford;Their arts, their magic powers with honours dueExalt; but be thyself what they record.ELEGY IV. To an OFFICER. Written at ROME, 1756.FROM Latian fields, the mansions of Renown,Where fix'd the Warrior God his fated seat;Where infant Heroes learnt the martial frown,And little hearts for genuine glory beat;What for my friend, my soldier, shall I frame?What nobly-glowing verse that breathes of arms,To point his radiant path to deathless fame,By great examples, and terrific charms?Quirinus first, with bold, collected bands,The sinewy sons of strength, for empire strove;Beneath his thunder bow'd th' astonish'd lands,And temples rose to Mars, and to Feretrian Jove.War taught contempt of death, contempt of pain,And hence the Fabii, hence the Decii come:War urg'd the slaughter, though she wept the slain,Stern War, the rugged nurse of virtuous Rome.But not from antique fables will I draw,To fire thy feeling soul, a dubious aid,Though now, ev'n now, they strike with rev'rent awe,By Poets or Historians sacred made.Nor yet to thee the babbling Muse shall tellWhat mighty kings with all their legions wrought,What cities sunk, and storied nations fellWhen Caesar, Titus, or when Trajan fought.From private worth, and Fortune's private waysWhilst o'er yon hill th' exalted The trophies of Marius, now erected before the Capitol. Trophy showsTo what vast heights of incorrupted praiseThe great, the self-ennobled Marius rose.From steep Arpinum's rock-invested shade,From hardy Virtue's emulative school,His daring flight th' expanding Genius made,And by obeying nobly learnt to rule.Abash'd, confounded, stern Iberia groan'd,And Afric trembled to her utmost coasts;When the proud land its destin'd Conqueror own'dIn the new Consul, and his veteran hosts.Yet chiefs are madmen, and Ambition weak,And mean the joys the laurel'd harvests yield,If Virtue fail. Let Fame, let Envy speakOf Capsa's walls, and Sextia's wat'ry field.But sink for ever, in oblivion cast,Dishonest triumphs, and ignoble spoils.Minturnae's Marsh severely paid at lastThe guilty glories gain'd in civil broils.Nor yet his vain contempt the Muse shall praiseFor scenes of polish'd life, and letter'd worth;The steel-ribb'd Warrior wants not Envy's waysTo darken theirs, or call his merits forth.Witness yon Cimbrian Trophies!—Marius, thereThy ample pinion found a space to fly;As the plum'd eagle soaring sails in air,In upper air, and scorns a middle sky.Thence too thy country claim'd thee for her own,And bade the Sculptor's toil thy acts adorn,To teach in characters of living stoneEternal lessons to the youth unborn.For wisely Rome her warlike Sons rewardsWith the sweet labours of her Artists' hands;He wakes her Graces, who her empire guards,And both Minervas join in willing bands.O why, Britannia, why untrophied passThe patriot deeds thy godlike Sons display,Why breathes on high no monumental brass,Why swells no Arc to grace Culloden's Day?Wait we 'till faithless France submissive bowBeneath that Hero's delegated spear,Whose lightning smote Rebellion's haughty brow,And scatter'd her vile rout with horror in the rear?O Land of Freedom, Land of Arts, assumeThat graceful dignity thy merits claim;Exalt thy Heroes like imperial Rome,And build their virtues on their love of fame.So shall the modest worth, which checks my friend,Forget its blush when rous'd by Glory's charms;From breast to breast the generous warmth descend,And still new trophies rise, at once, to Arts and Arms.ELEGY V. To a FRIEND Sick. Written at ROME, 1756.'TWAS in this The insula Tiberina, where there are still some small remains of the famous temple of Aesculapius. isle, O Wright, indulge my lay,Whose naval form divides the Tuscan flood,In the bright dawn of her illustrious dayRome fix'd her Temple to the healing God.Here stood his altars, here his arm he bar'd,And round his mystic staff the serpent twin'd,Through crowded portals hymns of praise were heard,And victims bled, and sacred seers divin'd.On every breathing wall, on every roundOf column, swelling with proportion'd grace,Its stated seat some votive tablet found,And storied wonders dignified the place.Oft from the balmy blessings of repose,And the cool stillness of the night's deep shade,To light and health th' exulting Votarist rose,Whilst fancy work'd with med'cine's powerful aid.Oft in his dreams (no longer clogg'd with fearsOf some broad torrent, or some headlong steep,With each dire form Imagination wearsWhen harrass'd Nature sinks in turbid sleep)Oft in his dreams he saw diffusive dayThrough bursting glooms its cheerful beams extend;On billowy clouds saw sportive Genii play,And bright Hygeia from her heaven descend.What marvel then, that man's o'erflowing mindShould wreath-bound columns raise, and altars fair,And grateful offerings pay, to Powers so kind,Though fancy-form'd, and creatures of the Air.Who that has writh'd beneath the scourge of pain,Or felt the burthen'd languor of disease,But would with joy the slightest respite gain;And idolize the hand which lent him ease?To thee, my friend, unwillingly to thee,For truths like these the anxious Muse appeals.Can Memory answer from affliction free,Or speaks the sufferer what, I fear, he feels?No, let me hope ere this in Romely groveHygeia revels with the blooming Spring,Ere this the vocal seats the Muses loveWith hymns of praise, like Paeon's temple, ring.It was not written in the book of FateThat, wand'ring far from Albion's sea-girt plain,Thy distant Friend should mourn thy shorter date,And tell to alien woods and streams his pain.It was not written. Many a year shall roll,If aught th' inspiring Muse aright presage,Of blameless intercourse from Soul to Soul,And friendship well matur'd from Youth to Age.ELEGY VI. To another FRIEND. Written at ROME, 1756.BEHOLD, my friend, to this small The medal of Marcus Aurelius. orb confin'dThe genuine features of Aurelius' face;The father, friend, and lover of his kind,Shrunk to a narrow coin's contracted space.Not so his fame; for erst did heaven ordainWhilst seas should waft us, and whilst suns should warm,On tongues of men, the friend of man should reign,And in the arts he lov'd the patron charm.Oft as amidst the mould'ring spoils of Age,His moss-grown monuments my steps pursue;Oft as my eye revolves the historic page,Where pass his generous acts in fair review.Imagination grasps at many things,Which men, which angels might with rapture see;Then turns to humbler scenes its safer wings,And, blush not whilst I speak it, thinks on thee.With all that firm benevolence of mind,Which pities, whilst it blames, th' unfeeling vain,With all that active zeal to serve mankind,That tender suffering for another's pain,Why wert not thou to thrones imperial rais'd?Did heedless Fortune slumber at thy birth,Or on thy virtues with indulgence gaz'd,And gave her grandeurs to her sons of earth?Happy for thee, whose less distinguish'd sphereNow cheers in private the delighted eye,For calm Content, and smiling Ease are there,And, Heav'n's divinest gift, sweet Liberty.Happy for me, on life's serener floodWho sail, by talents as by choice restrain'd,Else had I only shar'd the general good,And lost the friend the Universe had gain'd.THE LYRIC MUSE TO MR. MASON. On the Recovery of the RIGHT HONOURABLE the EARL of HOLDERNESSE from a dangerous Illness.BY THE SAME.MASON, snatch the votive Lyre,D'Arcy lives, and I inspire.'Tis the Muse that deigns to ask:Can thy hand forget its task?Or can the Lyre its strains refuseTo the Patron of the Muse?Hark, what notes of artless loveThe feather'd poets of the grove,Grateful for the bowers they fill,Warble wild on Sion hill;In tuneful tribute duly paidTo the Master of the shade!And shall the Bard sit fancy-proofBeneath the hospitable roof,Where every menial face affordsRaptur'd thoughts that want but words?And the Patron's dearer part,The gentle sharer of his heart,Wears her wonted charms again?Time, that felt Affliction's chain,Learns on lighter wings to move;And the tender pledge of love,Sweet Amelia, now is prestWith double transport to her breast.Sweet Amelia, thoughtless why,Imitates the general joy;Innocent of care or guileSee the lovely Mimic smile,And, as the heart-felt raptures rise,Catch them from her Mother's eyes.Does the noisy town denySoothing airs, and extasy?Sion's shades afford retreat,Thither bend thy pilgrim feet.There bid th' imaginary train,Coinage of the Poet's brain,Not only in effects appear,But forms, and limbs, and features wear;Let festive Mirth, with flow'rets crown'd,Lightly tread the measur'd round;And Peace, that seldom knows to shareThe Statesman's friendly bowl, be there;While rosy Health, superior guest,Loose to the Zephyrs bares her breast;And, to add a sweeter grace,Give her soft Amelia's face.Mason, why this dull delay?Haste, to Sion haste away.There the Muse again shall ask,Nor thy hand forget its task;Nor the Lyre its strains refuseTo the Patron of the Muse.ON THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL, TRANSLATED From the LATIN of ISAAC HAWKINS BROWNE, EsqBY SOAME JENNYNS, EsqBOOK I.TO all inferior animals 'tis givenT' enjoy the state allotted them by Heaven;No vain researches e'er disturb their rest,No fears of dark futurity molest.Man, only Man, solicitous to knowThe springs whence Nature's operations flow,Plods through a dreary waste with toil and pain,And reasons, hopes, and thinks, and lives in vain;For sable Death still hov'ring o'er his head,Cuts short his progress, with his vital thread.Wherefore, since Nature errs not, do we findThese seeds of Science in the human mind,If no congenial fruits are predesign'd?For what avails to man this power to roamThrough ages past, and ages yet to come,T' explore new worlds o'er all th' aetherial way,Chain'd to a spot, and living but a day,Since all must perish in one common grave,Nor can these long laborious searches save?Were it not wiser far, supinely laid,To sport with Phyllis in the noontide shade?Or at thy jovial festivals appear,Great Bacchus, who alone the soul can clearFrom all that it has felt, and all that it can fear?Come on then, let us feast: let Chloe sing,And soft Neaera touch the trembling string;Enjoy the present hour, nor seek to knowWhat good or ill to-morrow may bestow.But these delights soon pall upon the taste;Let's try then if more serious cannot last:Wealth let us heap on wealth, or fame pursue,Let power and glory be our points in view;In courts, in camps, in senates let us live,Our levees crowded like the buzzing hive;Each weak attempt the same sad lesson brings:Alas, what vanity in human things!What means then shall we try? where hope to findA friendly harbour for the restless mind?Who still, you see, impatient to obtainKnowledge immense, (so Nature's laws ordain)Ev'n now, though fetter'd in corporeal clay,Climbs step by step the prospect to survey,And seeks, unweary'd, Truth's eternal ray.No fleeting joys she asks, which must dependOn the frail senses, and with them must end;But such as suit her own immortal fame,Free from all change, eternally the same.Take courage then, these joys we shall attain:Almighty Wisdom never acts in vain;Nor shall the soul, on which it has bestow'dSuch powers, e'er perish, like an earthly clod;But purg'd at length from soul corruption's stain,Freed from her prison, and unbound her chain,She shall her native strength, and native skies regain:To heav'n an old inhabitant return,And draw nectareous streams from truth's perpetual urn.Whilst life remains (if life it can be call'd,T' exist in fleshly bondage thus enthrall'd)Tir'd with the dull pursuit of worldly things,The soul scarce wakes, or opes her gladsome wings,Yet still the godlike exile in disgraceRetains some marks of her celestial race;Else when from Mem'ry's store can she produceSuch various thoughts, or range them so for use?Can matter these contain, dispose, apply?Can in her cells such mighty treasures lie?Or can her native force produce them to the eye?Whence is this power, this foundress of all arts,Serving, adorning life, through all its parts,Which names impos'd, by letters mark'd those names,Adjusted properly by legal claims,From woods, and wilds collected rude mankind,And cities, laws, and governments design'd?What can this be, but some bright ray from heaven,Some emanation from Omniscience given?When now the rapid stream of EloquenceBears all before it, passion, reason, sense,Can its dread thunder, or its lightning's force,Derive their essence from a mortal source?What think you of the bard's enchanting art,Which, whether he attempts to warm the heartWith fabled scenes, or charm the ear with rhyme,Breathes all pathetic, lovely, and sublime?Whilst things on earth roll round from age to age,The same dull farce repeated; on the stageThe poet gives us a creation new,More pleasing, and more perfect than the true;The mind, who always to perfection hastes,Perfection, such as here she never tastes,With gratitude accepts the kind deceit,And thence foresees a system more compleat.Of those what think you, who the circling raceOf suns, and their revolving planets trace,And comets journeying through unbounded space?Say, can you doubt, but that th' all-searching soul,That now can traverse heaven from pole to pole,From thence descending visits but this earth,And shall once more regain the regions of her birth?Could she thus act, unless some Power unknown,From matter quite distinct, and all her own,Supported, and impell'd her? She approvesSelf-conscious, and condemns; she hates, and loves,Mourns, and rejoices, hopes, and is afraid,Without the body's unrequested aid:Her own internal strength her reason guides,By this she now compares things, now divides;Truth's scatter'd fragments piece by piece collects,Rejoins, and thence her edifice erects;Piles arts on arts, effects to causes ties,And rears th' aspiring fabric to the skies:From whence, as on a distant plain below,She sees from causes consequences flow,And the whole chain distinctly comprehends,Which from th' Almighty's throne to earth descends:And lastly, turning inwardly her eyes,Perceives how all her own ideas rise,Contemplates what she is, and whence she came,And almost comprehends her own amazing frame.Can mere machines be with such powers endued,Or conscious of those powers, suppose they could?For body is but a machine aloneMov'd by external force, and impulse not its own.Rate not th' extension of the human mindBy the plebeian standard of mankind,But by the size of those gigantic few,Whom Greece and Rome still offer to our view;Or Britain well-deserving equal praise,Parent of heroes too in better days.Why should I try her num'rous sons to nameBy verse, law, eloquence, consign'd to fame?Or who have forc'd fair Science into sightLong lost in darkness, and afraid of light?O'er all superior, like the solar ray,First Bacon usher'd in the dawning day,And drove the mists of sophistry away;Pervaded nature with amazing force,Following experience still throughout his course,And finishing at length his destin'd way,To Newton he bequeath'd the radiant lamp of day.Illustrious souls! if any tender caresAffect angelic breasts for man's affairs,If in your present happy heav'nly state,You're not regardless quite of Britain's fate,Let this degen'rate land again be blestWith that true vigour, which she once possest;Compel us to unfold our slumb'ring eyes,And to our ancient dignity to rise.Such wond'rous powers as these must sure be givenFor most important purposes by heaven;Who bids these stars as bright examples shineBesprinkled thinly by the hand divine,To form to virtue each degenerate time,And point out to the soul its origin sublime.That there's a self which after death shall live,All are concern'd about, and all believe;That something's ours, when we from life depart,This all conceive, all feel it at the heart;The wise of learn'd antiquity proclaimThis truth, the public voice declares the same;No land so rude but looks beyond the tombFor future prospects in a world to come.Hence, without hopes to be in life repaid,We plant slow oaks posterity to shade;And hence vast pyramids aspiring highLift their proud heads aloft, and time defy.Hence is our love or fame, a love so strong,We think no dangers great, or labours long,By which we hope our beings to extend,And to remotest times in glory to descend.For fame the wretch beneath the gallows lies,Disowning every crime for which he dies;Of life profuse, tenacious of a name,Fearless of death, and yet afraid of shame.Nature has wove into the human mindThis anxious care for names we leave behind,T' extend our narrow views beyond the tomb,And give an earnest of a life to come:For, if when dead we are but dust or clay,Why think of what posterity shall say?Her praise or censure cannot us concern,Nor ever penetrate the silent urn.What mean the nodding plumes, the fun'ral train,And marble monument that speaks in vain,With all those cares, which every nation paysTo their unfeeling dead in diff'rent ways!Some in the flower-strewn grave the corpse have lay'd,And annual obsequies around it pay'd,As if to please the poor departed shade;Others on blazing piles the body burn,And store their ashes in the faithful urn:But all in one great principle agreeTo give a fancy'd immortality.Why should I mention those, whose ouzy soilIs render'd fertile by th' o'erflowing Nile?Their dead they bury not, nor burn with fires,No graves they dig, erect no fun'ral pires;But, washing first th' emboweld'd body clean,Gums, spice, and melted pitch, they pour withinThen with strong fillets bind it round and round,To make each flaccid part compact, and sound;And lastly paint the varnish'd surface o'erWith the same features which in life it wore:So strong their presage of a future state,And that our nobler part survives the body's fate.Nations behold remote from reason's beams,Where Indian Ganges rolls his sandy streams,Of life impatient, rush into the fire,And willing victims to their Gods expire!Persuaded the loose soul to regions fliesBlest with eternal spring, and cloudless skies.Nor is less fam'd the oriental wifeFor stedfast virtue, and contempt of life:These heroines mourn not with loud female criesTheir husbands lost, or with o'erflowing eyes;But, strange to tell! their funeral piles ascend,And in the same sad flames their sorrows end;In hopes with them beneath the shades to rove,And there renew their interrupted love.In climes where Boreas breathes eternal cold,See numerous nations, warlike, fierce, and bold,To battle all unanimously run,Nor fire, nor sword, nor instant death they shun.Whence this disdain of life in every breast,But from a notion on their minds imprest,That all, who for their country die, are blest?Add too to these the once prevailing dreamsOf sweet Elysian groves, and Stygian streams:All shew with what consent mankind agreeIn the firm hope of Immortality.Grant these th' inventions of the crafty priest;Yet such inventions never could subsist,Unless some glimmerings of a future stateWere with the mind coaeval, and innate:For every fiction, which can long persuade,In truth must have its first foundations laid.Because we are unable to conceive,How unembodied soul can act, and live,The vulgar give them forms, and limbs, and faces,And habitations in peculiar places;Hence reasoners more refin'd, but not more wise,Struck with the glare of such absurdities,Their whole existence fabulous suspect,And truth and falshood in a lump reject;Too indolent to learn what may be known,Or else too proud that ignorance to own.For hard's the task the daubing to pervadeFolly and fraud on Truth's fair form have laid;Yet let that task be ours; for great the prize;Nor let us Truth's celestial charms despise,Because that priests, or poets, may disguise.That there's a God, from Nature's voice is clear:And yet what errors to this truth adhere!How have the fears and follies of mankindNow multiply'd their Gods, and now subjoin'dTo each the frailties of the human mind!Nay, superstition spread at length so wide,Beasts, birds, and onions too were deify'd.Th' Athenian sage, revolving in his mindThis weakness, blindness, madness of mankind,Foretold, that in maturer days, though late,When time should ripen the decrees of Fate,Some God would light us, like the rising day,Through error's maze, and chase these clouds away.Long since has time fulfill'd this great decree,And brought us aid from this Divinity.Well worth our search discoveries may be madeBy Nature, void of the celestial aid:Let's try what her conjectures then can reach;Nor scorn plain Reason, when she deigns to teach.That mind and body often sympathizeIs plain; such is this union Nature ties:But then as often too they disagree;Which proves the soul's superior progeny.Sometimes the body in full strength we find,Whilst various ails debilitate the mind;At others, whilst the mind its force retains,The body sinks with sickness and with pains:Now did one common fate their beings end,Alike they'd sicken, and alike they'd mend.But sure experience, on the slightest view,Shews us, that the reverse of this is true;For when the body oft expiring lies,Its limbs quite senseless, and half clos'd its eyes,The mind new force and eloquence acquires,And with prophetic voice the dying lips inspires,Of like materials were they both compos'd,How comes it, that the mind, when sleep has clos'dEach avenue of sense, expatiates wide,Her liberty restor'd, her bonds unty'd?And like some bird who from its prison flies,Claps her exulting wings, and mounts the skies.Grant that corporeal is the human mind,It must have parts in infinitum join'd;And each of these must will, perceive, design,And draw confus'dly in a different line;Which then can claim dominion o'er the rest,Or stamp the ruling passion in the breast?Perhaps the mind is form'd by various artsOf modelling, and figuring these parts;Just as if circles wiser were than squares;But surely common sense aloud declaresThat site and figure are as foreign quiteFrom mental powers, as colours black or white.Allow that motion is the cause of thought,With what strange powers must motion then be fraught?Reason, sense, science, must derive their sourceFrom the wheel's rapid whirl, or pully's force;Tops whipp'd by school-boys sages must commence,Their hoops, like them, be cudgel'd into sense,And boiling pots o'erflow with eloquence.Whence can this very motion take its birth?Not sure from matter, from dull clods of earth;But from a living spirit lodg'd within,Which governs all the bodily machine:Just as th' Almighty Universal SoulInforms, directs, and animates the whole.Cease then to wonder how th' immortal mindCan live, when from the body quite disjoin'd;But rather wonder, if she e'er could die,So fram'd, so fashion'd for eternity;Self-mov'd, not form'd of parts together ty'd,Which time can dissipate, and force divide;For beings of this make can never die,Whose powers within themselves, and their own essence lie.If to conceive how any thing can beFrom shape abstracted and localityIs hard; what think you of the Deity?His Being not the least relation bears,As far as to the human mind appears,To shape, or size, similitude or place,Cloath'd in no form, and bounded by no space.Such then is God, a Spirit pure refin'dFrom all material dross, and such the human mind.For in what part of essence can we seeMore certain marks of Immortality?Ev'n from this dark confinement with delightShe looks abroad, and prunes herself for flight;Like an unwilling inmate, longs to roamFrom this dull earth, and seek her native home.Go then, forgetful of its toil and strife,Pursue the joys of this fallacious life;Like some poor fly, who lives but for a day,Sip the fresh dews, and in the sunshine play,And into nothing then dissolve away.Are these our great pursuits? is this to live?These all the hopes this much-lov'd world can give?How much more worthy envy is their fate,Who search for truth in a superior state!Not groping step by step, as we pursue,And following reason's much-entangled clue,But with one great, and instantaneous view.But how can sense remain, perhaps you'll say,Corporeal organs if we take away,Since it from them proceeds, and with them must decay?Why not? or why may not the soul receiveNew organs, since ev'n art can these retrieve?The silver trumpet aids th' obstructed ear,And optic glasses the dim eye can clear;These in mankind new faculties create,And lift him far above his native state;Call down revolving planets from the sky,Earth's secret treasures open to his eye,The whole minute creation make his own▪With all the wonders of a world unknown.How could the mind, did she alone dependOn sense, the errors of those senses mend?Yet oft' we see those senses she corrects,And oft' their information quite rejects.In distances of things, their shapes and size,Our reason judges better than our eyes.Declares not this the soul's pre-eminenceSuperior to, and quite distinct from sense?For sure 'tis likely, that, since now so highClogg'd and unfledg'd she dares her wings to try,Loos'd, and mature, she shall her strength display,And soar at length to Truth's refulgent ray.Inquire you how these powers we shall attain?'Tis not for us to know; our search is vain.Can any now remember or relateHow he existed in the embryo state?Or one from birth insensible of dayConceive ideas of the solar ray?That light's deny'd to him, which others see,He knows, perhaps you'll say—and so do we.The mind contemplative finds nothing hereOn earth, that's worthy of a wish or fear:He, whose sublime pursuit is God and truth,Burns, like some absent and impatient youth,To join the object of his warm desires,Thence to sequester'd shades and streams retires,And there delights his passion to rehearseIn wisdom's sacred voice, or in harmonious verse.To me most happy therefore he appears,Who having once, unmov'd by hopes or fears,Survey'd this sun, earth, ocean, clouds, and flame,Well satisfy'd returns from whence he came.Is life a hundred years, or e'er so few,'Tis repetition all, and nothing new;A fair, where thousands meet, but none can stay,An inn, where travellers bait, then post away;A sea, where man perpetually is tost,Now plung'd in bus'ness, now in trifles lost;Who leave it first, the peaceful port first gain;Hold then! no farther launch into the main:Contract your sails; life nothing can bestowBy long continuance, but continued woe,The wretched privilege daily to deploreThe funerals of our friends, who go before;Diseases, pains, anxieties, and cares,And age surrounded with a thousand snares.But whither hurry'd by a generous scornOf this vain world? ah! whither am I borne?Let none unbid th' Almighty's standard quit:Howe'er severe our post, we must submit.Could I a firm persuasion once attainThat after death no being would remain;To those dark shades I'd willingly descend,Where all must sleep, this drama at an end:Nor life accept, although renew'd by FateEv'n from its earliest and its happiest state.Might I from Fortune's bounteous hand receiveEach boon, each blessing in her power to give,Genius, and science, morals, and good sense,Unenvy'd honours, wit, and eloquence,A numerous offspring to the world well known,Both for paternal virtues and their own;Ev'n at this mighty price I'd not be boundTo tread the same dull circle round and round;The soul requires enjoyments more sublime,By space unbounded, undestroy'd by time.BOOK II.GOD then through all creation gives, we find,Sufficient marks of an indulgent mind,Excepting in ourselves; ourselves of allHis works the chief on this terrestrial ball,His own bright image, who alone unblestFeel ills perpetual, happy all the rest.But hold, presumptuous! charge not heav'n's decreeWith such injustice, such partiality.Yet true it is, survey we life around,Whole hosts of ills on every side are found;Who wound not here and there by chance a foe,But at the species meditate the blow.What millions perish by each others handsIn war's fierce rage! or by the dread commandsOf tyrants languish out their lives in chains,Or lose them in variety of pains!What numbers pinch'd by want and hunger die,In spite of Nature's liberality!(Those, still more numerous, I to name disdain,By lewdness and intemperance justly slain!)What numbers, guiltless of their own disease,Are snatch'd by sudden death, or waste by slow degrees!Where then is Virtue's well-deserv'd reward!—Let's pay to Virtue every due regard:That she enables man, let us confess,To bear those evils, which she can't redress;Gives hope, and conscious peace, and can assuageTh' impetuous tempests both of lust and rage;Yet she's a guard so far from being sure,That oft her friends peculiar ills endure:Where Vice prevails severest is their fate,Tyrants pursue them with a three-fold hate.How many, struggling in their country's cause,And from their country meriting applause,Have fall'n by wretches fond to be inslav'd,And perish'd by the hands themselves had sav'd!Soon as superior worth appears in view,See knaves and fools united to pursue!The man so form'd they all conspire to blame,And Envy's pois'nous tooth attacks his fame;Should he at length, so truly good and great,Prevail, and rule with honest views the state,Then must he toil for an ungrateful race,Submit to clamor, libels, and disgrace;Threaten'd, oppos'd, defeated in his ends,By foes seditious, and aspiring friends.Hear this, and tremble! all who would be great,Yet know not what attends that dang'rous wretched state.Is private life from all these evils free?Vice of all kinds, rage, envy, there we see,Deceit, that Friendship's mask insidious wears,Quarrels and feuds, and law's intangling snares.But there are pleasures still in human life,Domestic ease, a tender loving wife,Children, whose dawning smiles your heart engage,The grace and comfort of soft-stealing age.If happiness exists, 'tis surely here—But are these joys exempt from care and fear?Need I the miseries of that state declare,When different passions draw the wedded pair?Or say how hard those passions to discern,Ere the dye's cast, and 'tis too late to learn?Who can insure, that what is right, and good,These children shall pursue? or, if they shou'd,Death comes when least you fear so black a day,And all your blooming hopes are snatch'd away.We say not, that these ills from virtue flow:Did her wise precepts rule the world, we knowThe golden ages would again begin,But 'tis our lot in this to suffer, and to sin.Observing this, some sages have decreedThat all things from two causes must proceed:Two principles with equal power endued,This wholly evil, that supremely good.From this arise the miseries we endure,Whilst that administers a friendly cure.Hence life is chequer'd still with bliss and woe;Hence tares with golden crops promiscuous grow;And poisonous serpents make their dread reposeBeneath the covert of the fragrant rose.Can such a system satisfy the mind?Are both these Gods in equal power conjoin'd,Or one superior? Equal if you say,Chaos returns, since neither will obey.Is one superior? good or ill must reign,Eternal joy, or everlasting pain.Whiche'er is conquer'd must entirely yield,And the victorious God enjoy the field.Hence with these fictions of the Magi's brain!Hence ouzy Nile, with all her monstrous train!Or comes the Stoic nearer to the right?He holds, that whatsoever yields delight,Wealth, fame, externals all, are useless things;Himself half-starving happier far than kings.'Tis fine indeed to be so wond'rous wise!By the same reas'ning too he pain denies;Roast him, or flay him, break him on the wheel,Retract he will not, though he can't but feel▪Pain's not an ill, he utters with a groan;What then? an inconvenience 'tis, he'll own.What vigour, health, and beauty? are these good?No: they may be accepted, not pursued:Absurd to squabble thus about a name,Quibbling with diff'rent words that mean the same.Stoic, were you not fram'd of flesh and blood,You might be blest without external good;But know, be self-sufficient as you can,You are not spirit quite, but frail and mortal man.But since these sages, so absurdly wise,Vainly pretend enjoyments to despise,Because externals, and in Fortune's power,Now mine, now thine, the blessings of an hour;Why value then that strength of mind, they boastAs often varying, and as quickly lost?A head-ach hurts it, or a rainy day,And a slow fever wipes it quite away.See Lord Somers. one whose councils, one Duke of Marlborough▪ whose conqu'ring handOnce sav'd Britannia's almost finking land:Examples of the mind's extensive power,Examples too how quickly fades that flower.Dean Swift.Him let me add, whom late we saw excelIn each politer kind of writing well;Whether he strove our follies to exposeIn easy verse, or droll and hum'rous prose;Few years, alas! compel his throne to quitThis mighty monarch o'er the realms of wit,See self-surviving he's an idiot grown!A melancholy proof our parts are not our own.Thy tenets, Stoic, yet we may forgive,If in a future state we cease to live.For here the virtuous suffer much, 'tis plain;If pain is evil, this must God arraign;And on this principle confess we must,Pain can no evil be, or God must be unjust.Blind man! whose reason such strait bounds confine,That ere it touches truth's extremest line,It stops amaz'd, and quits the great design.Own you not, Stoic, God is just and true?Dare to proceed; secure this path pursue:'Twill soon conduct you far beyond the tomb,To future justice, and a life to come.This path, you say, is hid in endless night,'Tis self-conceit alone obstructs your sight;You stop, ere half your destin'd course is run,And triumph, when the conquest is not won;By this the Sophists were of old misled:See what a monstrous race from one mistake is bred!Hear then my argument:—confess we must,A God there is, supremely wise and just:If so, however things affect our sight,As sings our bardPope., whatever is, is right.But is it right, what here so oft appears,That vice should triumph, virtue sink in tears?The inference then, that closes this debate,Is, that there must exist a future state.The wise, extending their inquiries wide,See how both states are by connection ty'd;Fools view but part, and not the whole survey,So crowd existence all into a day.Hence are they led to hope, but hope in vain,That Justice never will resume her reign;On this vain hope adulterers, thieves rely,And to this altar vile assassins fly."But rules not God by general laws divine?"Man's vice, or virtues, change not the design."What laws are these? instruct us if you can:—There's one design'd for brutes, and one for man:Another guides inactive matter's course,Attracting, and attracted by its force:Hence mutual gravity subsists betweenFar distant worlds, and ties the vast machine.The laws of life why need I call to mind,Obey'd by birds, and beasts of every kind;By all the sandy desart's savage brood,And all the num'rous offspring of the flood;Of these none uncontroul'd and lawless rove,But to some destin'd end spontaneous move.Led by that instinct, heav'n itself inspires,Or so much reason, as their state requires;See all with skill acquire their daily food,All use those arms, which Nature has bestow'd;Produce their tender progeny, and feedWith care parental, whilst that care they need!In these lov'd offices compleatly blest,No hopes beyond them, nor vain fears molest.Man o'er a wider field extends his views;God through the wonders of his works pursues;Exploring thence his attributes and laws,Adores, loves, imitates th' Eternal Cause;For sure in nothing we approach so nighThe great example of divinity,As in benevolence: the patriot's soulKnows not self-center'd for itself to roll,But warms, enlightens, animates the whole:Its mighty orb embraces first his friends,His country next, then man; nor here it ends,But to the meanest animal descends.Wise Nature has this social law confirm'd,By forming man so helpless, and unarm'd;His want of others' aid, and power of speechT' implore that aid, this lesson daily teach.Mankind with other animals compare,Single how weak and impotent they are!But, view them in their complicated state,Their powers how wond'rous, and their strength how great,When social virtue individuals joins,And in one solid mass, like gravity combines!This then's the first great law by Nature giv'n,Stamp'd on our souls, and ratify'd by Heav'n;All from utility this law approve,As every private bliss must spring from social love.Why deviate then so many from this law?See passions, custom, vice, and folly draw!Survey the rolling globe from East to West,How few, alas! how very few are blest!Beneath the frozen poles, and burning line,What poverty and indolence combine,To cloud with Error's mists the human mind!No trace of man but in the form we find.And are we free from error, and distress,Whom Heav'n with clearer light has pleas'd to bless?Whom true religion leads? (for she but leadsBy soft persuasion, not by force proceeds;)Behold how we avoid this radiant sun!This proffer'd guide how obstinately shun,And after Sophistry's vain systems run!For these as for essentials we engageIn wars, and massacres, with holy rage;Brothers by brothers' impious hands are slain.Mistaken zeal, how savage is thy reign!Unpunish'd vices here so much abound,All right and wrong, all order they confound:These are the giants, who the gods defy,And mountains heap on mountains to the sky.Sees this th' Almighty Judge, or seeing spares,And deems the crimes of man beneath his cares?He sees; and will at last rewards bestow,And punishments, not less assur'd for being slow.Nor doubt I, though this state confus'd appears,That ev'n in this God sometimes interferes:Sometimes, lest man should quite his power disown,He makes that pow'r to trembling nations known:But rarely this; not for each vulgar end,As Superstition's idle tales pretend,Who thinks all foes to God, who are her own,Directs his thunder, and usurps his throne.Nor know I not, how much a conscious mindAvails to punish, or reward mankind;Ev'n in this life thou, impious wretch, must feelThe Fury's scourges, and th' infernal wheel;From man's tribunal, though thou hop'st to run,Thyself thou canst not, nor thy conscience shun:What must thou suffer, when each dire disease,The progeny of vice, thy fabric seize?Consumption, fever, and the racking painOf spasms, and gout, and stone, a frightful train!When life new tortures can alone supply,Life thy sole hope thou'lt hate, yet dread to die.Should such a wretch to num'rous years arrive,It can be little worth his while to live;No honours, no regards, his age attend,Companions fly: he ne'er could have a friend:His flatterers leave him, and with wild affrightHe looks within, and shudders at the sight:When threat'ning Death uplifts his pointed dart,With what impatience he applies to art,Life to prolong amidst disease and pains!Why this, if after it no sense remains?Why should he choose these miseries to endure,If Death could grant an everlasting cure?'Tis plain there's something whispers in his ear,(Though fain he'd hide it) he has much to fear.See the reverse! how happy those we find,Who know by merit to engage mankind!Prais'd by each tongue, by every heart belov'd,For Virtues practis'd, and for Arts improv'd:Their easy aspects shine with smiles serene,And all is peace and happiness within:Their sleep is ne'er disturb'd by fears, or strife,Nor lust, nor wine, impair the springs of life.Him Fortune cannot sink, nor much elate,Whose views extend beyond this mortal state;By age when summon'd to resign his breath,Calm, and serene, he sees approaching death,As the safe port, the peaceful silent shore,Where he may rest, life's tedious voyage o'er:He, and he only, is of death afraid,Whom his own conscience has a coward made;Whilst he, who Virtue's radiant course has run,Descends like a serenely-setting sun:His thoughts triumphant Heaven alone employs,And hope anticipates his future joys.So good, so blest, th' illustrious Bishop of Worcester. See vol. II. p. 30.Hough we find,Whose image dwells with pleasure on my mind;The Mitre's glory, Freedom's constant friend,In times which ask'd a champion to defend;Who, after near a hundred virtuous years,His senses perfect, free from pains and fears,Replete with life, with honours, and with age,Like an applauded actor left the stage;Or like some victor in th' Olympic games,Who, having run his course, the crown of Glory claims.From this just contrast plainly it appears,How Conscience can inspire both hopes and fears:But whence proceed these hopes, or whence this dread,If nothing really can affect the dead?See all things join to promise and presageThe sure arrival of a future age!Whate'er their lot is here, the good and wiseNor doat on life, nor peevishly despise.An honest man, when Fortune's storms begin,Has Consolation always sure within;And, if she sends a more propitious gale,He's pleas'd, but not forgetful it may fail.Nor fear that he, who sits so loose to life,Should too much shun its labours, and its strife;And, scorning wealth, contented to be mean,Shrink from the duties of this bustling scene;Or, when his country's safety claims his aid,Avoid the fight, inglorious and afraid:Who scorns life most must surely be most brave,And he, who power contemns, be least a slave:Virtue will lead him to Ambition's ends,And prompt him to defend his country, and his friends.But still his merit you can not regard,Who thus pursues a posthumous reward:His soul, you cry, is uncorrupt and great,Who, quite uninfluenc'd by a future state,Embraces Virtue from a nobler senseOf her abstracted, native excellence,From the self-conscious joy her essence brings,The beauty, fitness, harmony of things.It may be so: yet he deserves applause,Who follows where instructive Nature draws;Aims at rewards by her indulgence given,And soars triumphant on her wings to Heaven.Say what this venal virtuous man pursues,No mean rewards, no mercenary views;Not wealth usurious, or a num'rous train,Not fame by fraud acquir'd, or title vain!He follows but where Nature points the road,Rising in Virtue's school, till he ascends to God.But we, th' inglorious common herd of man,Sail without compass, toil without a plan;In Fortune's varying storms for ever tost,Shadows pursue, that in pursuit are lost;Mere infants all, 'till life's extremest day,Scrambling for toys, then tossing them away.Who rests of Immortality assur'dIs safe, whatever ills are here endur'd:He hopes not vainly in a world like thisTo meet with pure uninterrupted bliss;For good and ill, in this imperfect state,Are ever mix'd by the decrees of Fate.With Wisdom's richest harvest Folly grows,And baleful hemlock mingles with the rose;All things are blended, changeable, and vain,No hope, no wish, we perfectly obtain;God may perhaps (might human Reason's linePretend to fathom infinite design)Have thus ordain'd things, that the restless mindNo happiness compleat on earth may find;And, by this friendly chastisement made wise,To Heaven her safest, best retreat may rise.Come then, since now in safety we have pastThrough Error's rocks, and see the port at last,Let us review, and recollect the whole.—Thus stands my argument.—The thinking soulCannot terrestrial or material be,But claims by Nature Immortality:God, who created it, can make it end,We question not, but cannot apprehendHe will; because it is by him enduedWith strong ideas of all-perfect Good,With wond'rous powers to know, and calculateThings too remote from this our earthly state;With sure presages of a life to come,All false and useless, if beyond the tombOur beings cease: we therefore can't believeGod either acts in vain, or can deceive.If every rule of equity demands,That Vice and Virtue from th' Almighty's handsShould due rewards and punishments receive,And this by no means happens whilst we live;It follows, that a time must surely come,When each shall meet their well-adjusted doom:Then shall this scene, which now to human sightSeems so unworthy Wisdom infinite,A system of consummate skill appear,And, every cloud dispers'd, be beautiful and clear.Doubt we of this! what solid proof remains,That o'er the world a wise Disposer reigns?Whilst all Creation speaks a power divine,Is it deficient in the main design?Not so: the day shall come, (pretend not nowPresumptuous to enquire or when, or how)—But after death shall come th' important day,When God to all his justice shall display;Each action with impartial eyes regard,And in a just proportion punish and reward.THE ARBOUR: AN ODE TO CONTENTMENT.BY MR. THOMAS COLEOf Queen's College, Cambridge..TO these lone shades, where Peace delights to dwell,May Fortune oft permit me to retreat:Here bid the world, with all its cares, farewel,And leave its pleasures to the rich and great.Oft as the summer's sun shall cheer this sceneWith that mild gleam which points his parting ray,Here let my soul enjoy each eve serene,Here share its calm, 'till life's declining day.No gladsome image then should 'scape my sight,From these gay flowers, which border near my eye,To yon bright cloud, that decks, with richest light,The gilded mantle of the western sky.With ample gaze I'd trace that ridge remote,Where opening cliffs disclose the boundless main;With earnest ken from each low hamlet noteThe steeple's summit peeping o'er the plain.What various works that rural landscape fill,Where mingling hedge-rows beauteous fields inclose;And prudent Culture, with industrious skill,Her chequer'd scene of crops and fallows shows!How should I love to mark that riv'let's maze,Through which it works its untaught course along;Whilst near its grassy banks the herd shall graze,And blithsome milkmaid chaunt her thoughtless song!Still would I note the shades of length'ning sheep,As scatter'd o'er the hill's slant brow they rove;Still note the day's last glimm'ring lustre creepFrom off the verge of yonder upland grove.Nor should my leisure seldom wait to viewThe slow-wing'd rooks in homeward train succeed;Nor yet forbear the swallow to pursue,With quicker glance, close skimming o'er the mead.But mostly here should I delight t' exploreThe bounteous laws of Nature's mystic power;Then muse on Him who blesseth all her store,And give to solemn thoughts the sober hour.Let mirth unenvy'd laugh with proud disdain,And deem it spleen one moment thus to waste;If so she keep far hence her noisy train,Nor interrupt those joys she cannot taste.Far sweeter streams shall flow from Wisdom's spring,Than she receives from Folly's costliest bowl;And what delights can her chief dainties bring,Like those which feast the heavenly-pensive soul?Hail, Silence, then! be thou my frequent guest;For thou art wont my gratitude to raise,As high as wonder can the theme suggest,Whene'er I meditate my Maker's praise.What joy for tutor'd Piety to learnAll that my Christian solitude can teach,Where weak-ey'd Reason's self may well discernEach clearer truth the gospel deigns to preach?No object here but may convince the mindOf more than thoughtful honesty shall need;Nor can Suspense long question here to findSufficient evidence to fix its creed.'Tis God that gives this bower its aweful gloom;His arched verdure does its roof invest;He breathes the life of fragrance on its bloom;And with his kindness makes its owner blest.Oh, may the guidance of thy grace attendThe use of all thy bounty shall bestow;Lest folly should mistake its sacred end,Or vice convert it into means of woe.Incline and aid me still my life to steer,As conscience dictates what to shun or chuse;Nor let my heart feel anxious hope or fear,For aught this world can give me or refuse.Then shall not wealth's parade one wish excite,For wretched state to barter peace away;Nor vain ambition's lure my pride invite,Beyond Contentment's humble path to stray.What though thy wisdom may my lot deny,The treasur'd plenty freely to dispense;Yet well thy goodness can that want supplyWith larger portions of benevolence.And sure the heart that wills the gen'rous deedMay all the joys of Charity command;For she best loves from notice to recede,And deals her unsought gifts with secret hand.Then will I sometimes bid my fancy stealThat unclaim'd wealth no property restrains;Soothe with fictitious aid my friendly zeal,And realize each godly act she feigns.So shall I gain the gold without alloy;Without oppression, toil, or treach'rous snares;So shall I know its use, its power employ,And yet avoid its dangers and its cares.And, spite of all that boastful wealth can do,In vain would Fortune strive the rich to bless,Were they not flatter'd with some distant viewOf what she ne'er can give them to possess.E'en Wisdom's high conceit great wants would feel,If not supply'd from Fancy's boundless store;And nought but shame makes power itself conceal,That she, to satisfy, must promise more.But though experience will not fail to show,Howe'er its truth man's weakness may upbraid,That what he mostly values here below,Owes half its relish to kind Fancy's aid;Yet should not Prudence her light wing command,She may too far extend her heedless flight;For Pleasure soon shall quit her fairy-landIf Nature's regions are not held in sight.From Truth's abode, in search of kind deceit,Within due limits she may safely roam;If roving does not make her hate retreat,And with aversion shun her proper home.But thanks to those, whose fond parental careTo Learning's paths my youthful steps confin'd,I need not shun a state which lets me shareEach calm delight that soothes the studious mind.While genius lasts, his fame shall ne'er decay,Whose artful hand first caus'd its fruits to spread;In lasting volumes stampt the printed lay,And taught the Muses to embalm the dead.To him I owe each fair instructive page,Where Science tells me what her sons have known;Collects their choicest works from every age,And makes me wise with knowledge not my own.Books rightly us'd may every state secure,From fortune's evils may our peace defend;May teach us how to shun, or to endure,The foe malignant, and the faithless friend.Should rigid Want withdraw all outward aid,Kind stores of inward comfort they can bring;Should keen Disease life's tainted stream invade,Sweet to the soul from them pure health may spring.Should both at once man's weakly frame infest,Some letter'd charm may still relief supply;'Gainst all events prepare his patient breast,And make him quite resign'd to live, or die.For though no words can time or fate restrain;No sounds suppress the call of Nature's voice;Though neither rhymes, nor spells, can conquer pain,Nor magic's self make wretchedness our choice;Yet reason, while it forms the subtile plan,Some purer source of pleasure to explore,Must deem it vain for that poor pilgrim, man,To think of resting till his journey's o'er;Must deem each fruitless toil, by heaven design'dTo teach him where to look for real bliss;Else why should heaven excite the hope to findWhat balk'd pursuit must here for ever miss?THE GROTTO: AN ODE TO SILENCE.BY THE SAME.COME, musing Silence, nor refuse to shedThy sober influence o'er this darkling cell:The desart waste and lonely plainCould ne'er confine thy peaceful reign;Nor dost thou only love to dwell'Mid the dark mansions of the vaulted dead:For still at eve's serenest hourAll Nature owns thy soothing power:Oft hast thou deign'd with me to rove,Beneath the calm sequester'd grove;Oft deign'd my secret steps to leadAlong the dewy pathless mead;Or up the dusky lawn, to spyThe last faint gleamings of the twilight sky.Then wilt thou still thy pensive vot'ry meet,Oft as he calls thee to this gloomy seat:For here, with solemn mystic rite,Wert thou invok'd to consecrate the ground,Ere these rude walls were rear'd remote from sight,Or ere with moss this shaggy roof was crown'd.Hail! blessed parent of each purer thought,That doth at once the heart exalt and mend!Here wilt thou never fail to findMy vacant solitude inclin'dThy serious lessons to attend.For they I ween shall be with goodness fraught,Whether thou bid me meditateOn man, in untaught Nature's state;How far this life he ought to prize;How far its transient scenes despise;What heights his reason may attain,And where its proud attempts are vain;What toils his virtue ought to brave,For Hope's rewarding joys beyond the grave:Or if in man redeem'd you bid me traceEach wond'rous proof of heaven's transcendent grace;Then breathe some sparks of that celestial fire,Which in the raptur'd seraph glows above,Where fainted myriads crowd the joyful choir,And harp their praises round the throne of love.The trifling sons of Levity and PrideHence shall thy aweful seriousness exclude;Nor shall loud Riot's thoughtless trainWith frantic mirth this grott profane.No foe to peace shall here intrude.For thou wilt kindly bid each sound subside,Save such as soothe the list'ning sense,And serves to aid thy influence:Save where, soft-breathing o'er the plain,Mild Zephyr waves the rustling grain:Or where some stream, from rocky source,Slow trickles down its ceaseless course:Or where the sea's imperfect roarComes gently murm'ring from the distant shore.But most in Philomel, sweet bird of night,In plaintive Philomel, is thy delight:For she, or studious to prolong her grief,Or oft to vary her exaustless lay,With frequent pause, from thee shall seek relief,Nor close her strain, till dawns the noisy day.Without thy aid, to happier tasteful art,No deep instructive science could prevail:For only where thou dost preside,Can wit's inventive powers be tried:And reason's better task would fail,Did not thy haunts the serious theme impart.The critic, that with plodding head,Toils o'er the learning of the dead;The cloister'd hermit that explores,By midnight lamp, religion's stores;Each sage that marks, with thoughtful gaze,The lunar orb, or planet's maze;And every bard, that strays alongThe sylvan shade; intent on sacred song;Shall all to thee those various praises give,Which, through thy friendly aid, themselves receive;For though thou mayst from glory's seats retire,Where loud applause proclaim the honour'd name;Yet doth thy modest wisdom still inspireEach nobler work that swells the voice of Fame.THE PICTURE OF HUMAN LIFE. TRANSLATED FROM THE GREEK OF CEBES THE THEBAN. BY MR. T. SCOTTA dissenting minister at Ipswich. He was author of a paraphrase on the Book of Job and other performances; and died at Hapton, in the county of Norfolk, November 1775..Et vitae monstrata via est.
HOR.WHILE Saturn'sThis temple was probably in the city of Thebes, for Cebes was a Theban. fane with solemn step we trod,And view'd the Devoat offerings, for the most part in discharge of vows. votive honours of the God,A pictur'd tablet, o'er the portal rais'd,Attach'd our eye: in wonder lost, we gaz'd.The pencil there some strange device had wrought,And fables, all its own, disguis'd the thought.Nor camp it seem'd, nor city: the design,Whose moral mock'd our labour to divine,Was a wall'd court, where rose another bound,And, higher still, a third still less'ning ground.The nether area open'd at a gateWhere a vast crowd impatient seem'd to wait.Within, a group of female figures stood,In motley dress, a sparkling multitude.Without, in station at the porch, was seen A venerable form, in act and mienLike some great teacher, who with urgent tongue,Authoritative, warn'd the rushing throng.From doubt to doubt we wander'd; when appear'dA fire, who thus the hard solution clear'd:Strangers, that allegorie scene, I guess,Conquers your skill, your home-born wits no less.A foreigner, long since, whose nobler mindLearning's best culture to strong genius join'd,Here liv'd, convers'd, and shew'd th' admiring age Another Samian or Elean sage.He rear'd this dome to Saturn's aweful name,And gave that portrait to eternal fame.He reason'd much, high argument he chose,High as his theme his great conceptions rose.Such wisdom flowing from a mouth but youngI heard astonish'd, and enjoy'd it long:Him oft I heard this moral piece expound,With nervous eloquence and sense profound.Father, if leisure with thy will conspire,Yield, yield that comment to our warm desire.Free to bestow, I warn you first, beware:Danger impends, which summons all your care.Wise, virtuous, blest, whose heart our precepts gain;The Caselian and Salmasian editions read  wicked, instead of  bitter.Abandon'd, blind, and wretched, who disdain.For know, our purpos'd theme resembles bestThe fam'd Enigma of the Theban pest:Th' interpreter a plighted crown enjoy'd,The stupid perish'd, by the Sphinx destroy'd.Count Folly as a Sphinx to all mankind,Her problem, How is Good and Ill defin'd?Misjudging here, by Folly's law we die,Not instant victims of her cruelty;From day to day our reasoning part she wounds,Devours its strength, its noblest powers confounds▪ Awakes the lash of Vide ver. 186.Punishment, and tearsThe mind with pangs which guilty life prepares,With opposite effect, where thoughtful skillDiscerns the boundaries of Good and Ill,Folly must perish; and th' illumin'd breast To Virtue sav'd, is like th' immortals blest.Give audience, then, with no unheeding ear.O haste, no heedless auditors stand here,With strong desire, in dread suspence we wait,So great the blessing, and the bane so great.Instant, he rais'd his oratorial hand,And said (our eye he guided with a wand)Behold life's pencil'd scene, the natal gate,The numbers thronging into mortal state.Which danger's path, and which to safety bears,That ancient, Genius of mankind, declares.See him aloft, benevolent he bends,One hand is pointing, one a roll extendsReason's imperial code; by heav'n imprestIn living letters on the human breast.Oppos'd to him, Delusion plies her part,With skin of borrow'd snow, and blush of art,With hypocritic fawn, and eyes askanceWhence soft infection steals in every glance.Her faithless hand presents a crystal bowl,Whose pois'nous draught intoxicates the soul.Error and ignorance infus'd, composeThe fatal beverage which her fraud bestows.Is that the hard condition of our birth?Must all drink Error who appear on earth?All; yet in some their measure drowns the mind,Others but taste, less erring and less blind.The first court, or the sensual life.Th' Opinions, and Desires, and Pleasures riseBehind the gate, thick-glitt'ring on our eyes;Thick as bright atoms in the solar ray,Diverse their drap'ry and profusely gay.These tempting forms, each like a mistress drest,Our early steps with powerful charms arrest:Soon as we enter life, with various artOf dalliance they assail th' unguarded heart.All promise joy, we rush to their embrace;To bliss or ruin, here begins our race.Happy, thrice happy, who intrust their youthTo right Opinions, and ascend to Truth:Whom Wisdom tutors, whom the Virtues hail,And with their own substantial feast regale,The rest are harlots: by their flatt'ries won,In chase of empty sciences we run:Or Fortune's vanities pursue, and strayWith sensual Pleasure in more dangerous way.See the mad round their giddy followers tread,Delusion's cup strong-working in their head.Fast as one shoal of fools have delug'd through,Succeeding shoals the busy farce renew.Who on that globe stands stretching to her flight?Wild seems her aspect, and bereav'd of sight.Fortune, blind, frantic, deaf. With restless wingsThe world she ranges, and her favours flings:Flings and resumes, and plunders and bestows,Caprice divides the blessings and the woes.Her grace unstable as her tott'ring ball,Whene'er she smiles, she meditates our fall.When most we trust her, we are cheated most,In disolating loss we mourn our boast:Her cruel blast invades our hasty fruit,And withers all our glory at the root.What mean those multitudes around her? WhySuch motley attitudes perplex our eye?Some, in the act of wildest raptures, leap;In agony some wring their hands, and weep.Th' unreas'ning crowd; to passion's sequel blind,By passion fir'd, and impotent of mind;Competitors in clamorous suit, to shareThe toys she tosses with regardless air;Trifles, for solid worth by most pursu'd,Bright-colour'd vapours and fantastic good:The pageantry of wealth, the blaze of fame,Titles, an offspring to extend the name,Huge strength, or beauty which the strong obey,The victor's laurel, and despotic sway.These, humour'd in their vows, with lavish praiseThe glory of the gracious goddess raise:Those other, losers in her chance-full game,Shorn of their all, or frustrate in their aim,In murmurs of their hard mishap complain,And curse her partial and malignant reign.Now, further still in this low sensual ground,Traverse yon flowery mount's sequester'd bound.In the green center of those citron shades,'Mong gardens, fountains, flowery walks, and glades,Voluptuous Sin her powerful spells employs,Souls to seduce, seducing she destroys.See! Lewdness, loosely zon'd, her bosom bares,See! Riot her luxurious bowl prepares:There stands Avidity, with ardent eye,There dimpling Adulation smooths her lye.There station'd to what end?In watch for prey,Fortune's infatuate favourites of a day.These they caress, they flatter, they entreatTo try the pleasures of their soft retreat,Life disencumber'd, frolicksome, and free,All ease, all mirth, and high felicity.Whome'er by their inveigling arts they win,To tread that magic paradise of Sin,In airy dance his jocund hours skim round,Sparkles the bowl, the festal songs resound:His blood ferments, fir'd by the wanton glance,And his loose soul dissolves in am'rous trance.While circulating joys to joys succeed,While new delights the sweet delirium feed; The prodigal, in raptur'd fancy, rovesO'er fairy fields, and through Elysian groves:Sees glittering visions in succession rise,And laughs at Socrates the chaste and wise.'Till, sober'd by distress, awake, confus'd,Amaz'd, he knows himself a wretch abus'd;A short illusion his imagin'd feast,Himself the game, himself the slaughter'd beast,Now, raving for his squander'd wealth in vain,Slave to those tyrant jilts he drags their chain:Compell'd to suffer hard and hungry need,Compell'd to dare each foul and desp'rate deed.Villain, or knave, he joins the sharping tribe,Robs altars, or is perjur'd for a bribe:Stabs for a purse, his country pawns for gold,To every crime of blackest horror sold.Shiftless at length, of all resource bereft,In the dire gripe of Punishment he's left.Observe this strait-mouth'd cave: th' unwilling lightJust shews the dismal deep descent to night.In centry see these haggard crones, whose browsRude locks o'erhang, a frown their forehead plows:Swarthy and foul their shrivell'd skin behold,And flutt'ring shreds their vile defence from cold.High-brandishing her lash, with stern regard,Stands Punishment, an ever-waking ward;While sullen Melancholy mopes behind,Fix'd, with her head upon her knees reclin'd:And, frantic, with remorseful fury, thereFierce Anguish stamps, and rends her shaggy hair,Who that ill-featur'd spectre of a man,Shiv'ring in nakedness, so spare and wan?And she, whose eye aghast with horror stares,Whose meagre form a sister's likeness bears?Loud Lamentation, wild Despair. All these,Fell vultures, the devoted caitiff seize.Ah dreadful durance! with these fiends to dwell!What tongue the terrors of his soul can tell!Worry'd by these fould fiends, the wretch beginsSharp penance, wages of remember'd sins:Then deeper sinks, plung'd in the pit of Woe,Worse suff'rings in worse hell to undergo:Unless, rare guest, Repentance o'er the gloomDiffuse her radiance, and repeal his doom.She comes! meek-ey'd, array'd in grave attire,See Right Opinion, join'd with Good Desire,Handmaids of Truth: with those, an adverse pair(False Wisdom's minions, that deceiving fair)Attend her solemn step: the furies flee.Come forth, she calls, come forth to liberty,Guilt-harrass'd thrall: thy future lot decide,And, pondering well, elect thy future guide.Momentous option! choosing right, he'll findA sov'reign med'cine for his ulcer'd mind;Led to True Wisdom, whose cathartic bowl Recovers and beatifies the soul.Misguided else, a counterfeit he'll gain,Whose art is only to amuse the brain:From vice to studious folly now he flies,From bliss still erring, still betray'd by lyes.O heavens! where end the risks we mortals run?How dreadful this, and yet how hard to shun!Say, father, what distinctive marks declareThat counterfeit of Wisdom?The second court, or the studious life.View her there.At yonder gate, with decent port, she stands,Her spotless form that second court commands:Styl'd Wisdom by the crowd, the thinking fewKnow her disguise, the phantom of the true:Skill'd in all learning, skill'd in every artTo grace the head, not meliorate the heart.The sav'd, who meditate their noble flightFrom a bad world, to Wisdom's lofty height,Just touching at this inn, for short repast,Then speed their journey forward to its last.This the sole path?Another path there lies,The plain man's path, without proud Science wise.Who they, which traverse this deluder's bound?A busy scene, all thought or action round.Her lovers, whom her specious beauty warms,Who grasp, in vision, Truth's immortal charms,Vain of the glory of a false embrace:Fierce syllogistic tribes, a wrangling race,Bards rapt beyond the moon on Fancy's wings,And mighty masters of the vocal strings:Those who on labour'd speeches waste their oil,Those who in crabbed calculations toil,Who measure earth, who climb the starry road,And human fates by heav'nly signs forebode,Pleasure's philosophers, Lyceum's pride,Disdainful soaring up to heights untry'd.All who in learned trifles spin their wit,Or comment on the works by triflers writ.Who are yon active females, like in faceTo the lewd harlots, in the nether space,Vile agents of voluptuous, Sin?The same.Admitted here?Ev'n here, eternal shame!They boast some rarer less ignoble spoils,Art, wit, and reason, tangled in their toils.And Fancy, with th' Opinions in her rear,Enjoys these studious walks, no stranger here:Where wild hypothesis, and learn'd romanceToo oft lead up the philosophic dance.Still these ingenious heads, alas! retainDelusion's dose, still the vile dregs remainOf ignorance with madding folly join'd,And a soul heart pollutes th' embellish'd mind.Nor will presumption from their souls recede,Nor will they from one vicious plague be freed.'Till, weary of these vanities, they've foundTh' exalted way to Truth's enlighten'd ground,Quaff'd her cathartic, and all cleans'd within,By that strong energy, from pride and sin,Are heal'd and sav'd. But loit'ring here they spendLife's precious hours in thinking to no end:From science up to science let them rise,And arrogate the swelling style of wise;Their wisdom's folly, impotent and blind,Which cures not one distemper of the mind.Enough. Discover now the faithful road,Which mounts us to the joys of Truth's abode.Survey this solitary waste, which rearsNor bush nor herb, nor cottage there appears.At distance see yon strait and lonely gate(No crowds at the forbidding entrance wait)Its avenue a rugged rocky soil,Travell'd with painful step and tedious toil.Beyond the wicket, tow'ring in the skiesSee Difficulty's cragged mountain rise,Narrow and sharp th' ascent; each edge a brink,Whence to vast depth dire precipices sink.Is that the way to Wisdom? Dreadful way!The landskip frowns with danger and dismay.Yet higher still, around the mountain's browWinds yon huge rock, whose steep smooth sides allowNo track. Its top two sister figures grace,Health's rosy habit glowing in their face.With arms protended o'er the verge they lean,The promptitude of friendship in their mien.The powers of Continence and Patience, thereStation'd by Wisdom, her commission bear To rouze the spirit of her fainting sonThus far advanc'd, and urge and urge him on.Courage! they call, the coward's sloth disdain:Yet, yet awhile, the noble toil sustain:A lovely path soon opens to your sight.But ah! how climb'd that rock's bare slipp'ry height?These generous guides, who Virtue's course befriend,In succour of her pilgrim swift descend,Draw up their trembling charge; then, smiling, greetWith kind command to rest his weary feet.With their own force his panting breast they arm,And with their own intrepid spirit warm:Next, plight their guidance in his future wayTo Wisdom, and in rapt'rous view displayThe blissful road (there it invites your eyes)How smooth and easy to the foot it lies,Through beauteous land, from all annoyance clear,Of thorny evil and perplexing fear.The third court, or the virtuous life.Yon lofty grove's delicious bowers to gain,You cross th' expanse of this enamell'd plain; A meadow with eternal beauty bright,Beneath a purer heav'n, o'erflow'd with light.Full in the center of the plain, beholdA court far-flaming with its wall of goldAnd gate of diamond, where the righteous rest; This clime their home, the country of the blest:Here all the Virtues dwell, communion sweet!With Happiness, who rules the peaceful seat.In station at th' effulgent portal, seeA beauteous form of mildest majesty.Her eyes how piercing! how sedate her mien!Mature in life, her countenance serene:Spirit and solid thought each feature shows,And her plain robe with state unstudy'd flows.She stands upon a cube of marble, fix'd As the firm rock, two lovely nymphs betwixt,Her daughters, copies of her looks and air,Her candid Truth, and sweet Persuasion there:She, she is Wisdom. In her stedfast eyeBehold th' expressive type of certainty:Certain her way, and permanent the deedOf gift substantial to her friends decreed.She gives magnanimous contempt of fear,She gives the confidence erect and clear,And bids th' invulnerable mind to know Her safety from the future shafts of woe.O treasure, richer than the sea or land!But why without the walls her destin'd stand?There standing, she presents her potent bowl,Divine cathartic, which restores the soul.This asks a comment.In some dire disease,Macbaon's skill first purges off the lees:Then clear and strong the purple current flows,And life renew'd in every member glows:But if the patient all controul despise,Just victim of his stubborn will he dies.So Wisdom, by her rules, with healing artExpels Delusion's mischiefs from the heart;Blindness, and error, and high-boasting pride,Intemp'rance, lust, fierce wrath's impetuous tide,Hydropic avarice, all the plagues behindWhich in the first mad court oppress'd the mind.Thus purg'd, her pupil through the gate she brings,The Virtues hail their guest, the guest enraptur'd sings.Behold the spotless band, celestial charms!Scene that with awe chastises whom it warms:No harlotry, no paint, no gay excess,But beauty unaffected as their dress.See Knowledge grasping a refulgent star,See Fortitude in panoply of war:Justice her equal scale aloft displays,And rights both human and divine she weighs.There Moderation, all the pleasures boundIn brazen chains her dreaded feet surround.There bounteous Liberality expands To want, to worth, her ever-loaded hands.The florid hue of Temperance, her sideAdorn'd by Health, a nymph in blooming pride.Lo, soft-ey'd Meekness holds a curbing rein,Anger's high-mettled spirit to restrain:While Moral Order tunes her golden lyre,And white-rob'd Probity compleats the choir.O fairest of all fair! O blissful state!What hopes sublime our ravish'd soul dilate!Substantial hopes, if, by the doctrine taught,The fashion'd manners are to habit wrought.Yes; 'tis resolv'd. Well every nerve employ.Live, then, restor'd; and reap the promis'd joy.But whither do the Virtues lead their trust?To Happiness, rewarder of the just.Look upward to the hill beyond the grove,A sovereign pile extends its front above:Stately and strong, the lofty castle stands,Its boundless prospect all the courts commands.Within the porch, high on the jasper throne,Th' Imperial Mother by her form is known;Bright as the morn, when smiling on the hills,Earth, air, and sea, with vernal joy she fills.Rich without lavish cost her vest beholdIn colours of the sky, and fring'd with gold:A tiar, wreath'd with every flow'r that blowsOf liveliest tints, around her temples glows:Eternal bloom her snowy temples binds,Fearless of burning suns and blasting winds.Now, with a crown of wond'rous power, her hand (Assistant, round her, all the virtues stand)Adorns her hero, honourable meedOf conquests won by many a valiant deed.What conquests?Formidable beasts subdu'd:Lab'ring he fought, he routed, he pursu'd.Once, a weak prey, beneath their force he cowr'd,O'erthrown, and worry'd, and well-nigh devour'd:Till rouz'd with his inglorious sloth, possestWith generous ardour kindling in his breast,Lord of himself, the victor now constrains Those hostile monsters in his powerful chains.Explain those savage beasts at war with man.Error and Ignorance, which head the van,Heart-gnawing Grief, and loud-lamenting Woe,Incontinence, a wild-destroying foe,Rapacious Avarice; cruel numbers more:O'er all he triumphs now, their slave before.O great atchievements! more illustrious farThese triumphs, than the bloody wreaths of war.But, say; what salutary power is shedBy the fair crown, which decks the hero's head?Most beatific. For possessing thisHe lives, rich owner of man's proper bliss:Bliss independent or on wealth or power,Fame, birth, or beauty, or voluptuous hour.His hopes divorc'd from all exterior things,Within himself the fount of pleasure springs;Springs ever in the self approving breast,And his own honest heart's a constant feast.Where, next, his steps?He measures back his way,Conducted by the Virtues, to surveyHis first abode. The giddy crowd, below,Wasting their wretched span in crime, they show;How in the whirl of passions they are tost,And, shipwreck'd on the lurking shelves, are lost; Here fierce Ambition haling in her chainThe mighty, there a despicable trainImpure in Lusts inglorious fetter bound,And slaves of Avarice rooting up the ground:Thralls of Vain-glory, thralls of swelling Pride,Unnumber'd fools, unnumber'd plagues beside.All-powerless they to burst the galling band,To spring aloft, and reach yon happy land,Entangled, impotent the way to find,The clear instruction blotted from their mind Which the Good Genius gave; Guilt's gloomy fearsBecloud their suns and sadden all their years.I stand convinc'd, but yet perplex'd in thoughtWhy to review a well-known scene he's brought.Scene rudely known. Uncertain and confus'd,His judgement by illusions was abus'd.His evil was not evil, nor his goodAught else but vanity misunderstood.Confounding good and evil, like the throng,His life, like theirs, was action always wrong.Enlighten'd now in the true bliss of man,He shapes his alter'd course by Wisdom's plan:And, blest himself, beholds with weeping eyesThe madding world an hospital of sighs.This retrospection ended, where succeedsHis course?Where'er his wise volition leads.Where'er it leads, safety attends him still:Not safer, should he on Apollo's hill,Among the Nymphs, among the vocal Powers,Dwell in the Sanctum of Corycian bowers:Honour'd by all, the friend of human-kind,Belov'd physician of the sin-sick mind;Not Esculapius more, whose power to saveRedeems his patient from the yawning grave.But never more shall his old restless foesAwake his fears, nor trouble his repose?Never. In righteous habitude inur'd,From Passion's baneful anarchy secur'd,In each enticing scene, each instant hard,That sovereign antidote his mind will guard:Like him, who, of some virtuous drug possest,Grasps the fell viper coil'd within her nest,Hears her dire hissings, sees her terrors rise,And, unappall'd, destruction's tooth defies.Yon troops in motion from the mount explain,Various to view; for there a goodly train,With garlands crown'd, advance with comely pace,Noble their port, and in each tranquil faceJoy Sparkles: others, a bare-headed throng,Batter'd and gash'd, drag their slow steps along,Captives of some strange female crew.The crown'd,Long seeking, safe arriv'd at Wisdom's bound,Exult in her imparted grace. The restApostates.,Those on whom Wisdom, unprevailing, prestHer healing aid; rejected from her care,In evil plight their wicked days they wear:Those too, who Difficulty's hill had gain'd,There basely stopp'd, by dastard sloth detain'd:Apostate now, in thorny wilds they rove,Pursuing furies scourge the caitiff drove:Sorrows which gnaw, remorseful Thoughts which tear,Blindness of mind, and heart-oppressing Fear,With all the contumelious rout of Shame,And every ill, and every hateful name.Relaps'd to Lewdness, and her sensual Queen,Unblushing at themselves, but drunk with spleen,Wisdom's high worth their canker'd tongues dispraise,Revile her children, and blaspheme her ways.Deluded wretches, (thus their madness cries)Dull mopes, weak dupes of philosophic lyes,Uncomforted, unjoyous, and unblest,Lost from the pleasures here at large possest.What pleasures boast they?Pleasures of the stews,Pleasures which Riot's frantic bowls infuse.These high fruition their gross souls repute,And man's chief good to sink into a brute.But who that lovely bevy, blithe and gay,So smoothly gliding down the hilly way?The distinction between Opinion and Knowledge.Those are th' Opinions, who have guided rightThe unexperienc'd to the plain of light:Returning, new adventurers to bring,The blessings of the last-arriv'd they sing.Why ingress yielded to their favour'd wardAmong the Virtues, to themselves debarr'd?Opinion's foot is never never found Where Knowledge dwells, 'tis interdicted ground,At Wisdom's gate th' Opinions must resignTheir charge, those limits their employ confine.Thus trading barks, skill'd in the watery road,To distant climes convey their precious load,Then turn their prow, light bounding o'er the main,And with new traffic store their keels again.Thus far is clear. But yet untold remainsWhat the Good Genius to the crowd ordains,Just on the verge of life.The instructions of the Genius.He bids them hold A spirit with erected courage bold.Never (he calls) on Fortune's faith rely,Nor grasp her dubious gifts as property.Let not her smile transport, her frown dismay,Nor praise nor blame, nor wonder at her sway Which reason never guides: 'tis fortune still,Capricious chance and arbitrary will:Bad bankers, vain of treasure not their own,With foolish rapture hug the trusted loan;Impatient, when the powerful bond demands Its unremember'd cov'nant from their hands.Unlike to such, without a sigh restoreWhat Fortune lends: anon she'll lavish more:Repenting of her bounty snatch away,Yea seize your patrimonial fund for prey.Embrace her proffer'd boon, but instant rise,Spring upward, and secure a lasting prize,The gift which Wisdom to her sons divides;Knowledge, whose beam the doubting judgement guides,Scatters the sensual fog, and clear to view Distinguishes false interest from the true.Flee, flee to this, with unabating pace,Nor parly for a moment at the placeWhere Pleasure and her Harlots tempt, nor rest,But at False Wisdom's inn, a transient guest:For short refection, at her table sit,And taste what science may your palate hit:Then wing your journey forward till you reachTrue Wisdom, and imbibe the truths she'll teach.Such is th' advice the friendly Genius gives:He perishes who scorns; who follows, lives.And thus this moral piece instructs; if aughtIs mystic still, reveal your doubting thought.Thanks, generous Sire; tell, then, the transient bait,The Genius grants us at False Wisdom's gate.Natural knowledge, how far useful, and when unprofitable and hurtful.Whate'er in arts or sciences is foundOf solid use, in their capacious round,These, Plato reasons, like a curbing rein,Unruly youth from devious starts restrain.Must we, solicitous our souls to save,Assistance from these previous studies crave?Necessity there's none. We'll not denyTheir merit in some less utility;But they contribute, we aver, no partTo heal the manners and amend the heart.An author's meaning, in a tongue unknown,May glimmer through translation in our own:Yet, masters of his language, we might gainSome trivial purposes by tedious pain.So in the sciences, though rudely taught,We may attain the little that we ought;Yet, accurately known, they might conveyMore light, not wholly useless in its way.But virtue may be reach'd, through all her rules,Without the curious subtleties of schools.How! not the learn'd excel the common shoal,In powerful aids to meliorate the soul?Blind as the crowd, alas! to good and ill,Intangled by the like corrupted will,What boasts the man of letters o'er the rest?Skill'd in all tongues, of all the arts possest,What hinders but he sink into a sot,A libertine, or villain in a plot,Miser, or knave, or whatsoe'er you'll nameOf moral lunacy and reason's shame?Scandals too rife!How, then, for living rightAvail those studies, and their vaunted lightBeyond the vulgar?Nothing, But discloseThe cause from whence this strange appearance grows.Held by a potent charm in this retreat They dwell, content with nearness to the seatOf Virtuous Wisdom.Near, methinks, in vain:Since numbers, oft, from out the nether plain,'Scap'd from the snares of Lewdness and Excess,Undevious to her lofty station press,Yet pass these letter'd clans,What, then, are theseIn moral things advantag'd o'er the leesOf human race? in moral things, we findThese duller, or less tractable of mind.Decypher that.Pride, pride averts their eyes From offer'd light: in self-sufficience wise,Although unknowing, they presume to know:Clogg'd with that vain conceit they creep below,Nor can mount up to yon exalted bound,True Wisdom's mansion, by the humble found.Not found by these, till the vain visions spread,By False Opinion, in the learned head,Repentance scatter; and deceiv'd no more,They own th' illusion which deceiv'd before,That for True Wisdom they embrac'd her shade,And hence the healing of their souls delay'd.Strangers, these lessons, oft revolving, holdFast to your hearts, and into habit mould:To this high scope life's whole attention bend,Despise aught else as erring from your end.Do thus, or unavailing is my care,And all th' instruction dies away in air.The DROPSICAL MAN.By Mr. TAYLOR.A JOLLY, brave toper, who could not forbear,Though his life was in danger, old port and stale beer,Gave the doctors the hearing—but still would drink on,'Till the dropsy had swell'd him as big as a ton.The more he took physic the worse still he grew,And tapping was now the last thing he could do.Affairs at this crisis, and doctors come down,He began to consider—so sent for his son.Tom, see by what courses I've shorten'd my life,I'm leaving the world ere I'm forty and five;More than probable 'tis, that in twenty-four hours,This manor, this house, and estate will be yours;My early excesses may teach you this truth,That 'tis working for death to drink hard in one's youth.Says Tom (who's a lad of a generous spirit,And not like young rakes, who're in haste to inherit):Sir, don't be dishearten'd; although it be true,Th' operation is painful, and hazardous too,'Tis no more than what many a man has gone thro'.And then, as for years, you may yet be call'd young,Your life after this may be happy and long.Don't flatter me, Tom, was the father's reply,With a jest in his mouth, and a tear in his eye:Too well by experience, my vessels, thou know'st,No sooner are tapp'd, but they give up the ghost.PARADISE REGAIN'D.By H.T.I.SEEK not for Paradise with curious eyeIn Asiatic climes, where Tigris' wave,Mix'd with Euphrates in tumultuous joy,Doth the broad plains of Babylonia lave.II.'Tis gone with all its charms; and like a dream,Like Babylon itself, is swept away;Bestow one tear upon the mournful theme,But let it not the gentle heart dismay.III.For know where-ever love and virtue guide,They lead us to a state of heavenly bliss,Where joys unknown to guilt and shame preside,And pleasures unalloy'd each hour increase.IV.Behold that grove, whose waving boughs admit,Through the live colonade, the fruitful hill,A moving prospect with fat herds replete,Whose lowing voices all the valleys fill.V.There through the spiry grass where glides the brook,(By yon tall poplar which erects its headAbove the verdure of the neighbouring oak,)And gently murmurs o'er th' adjoining mead;VI.Philander and Cleora, happy pair,Taste the cool breezes of the gentle wind;Their breasts from guilt, their looks are free from care,Sure index of a calm contented mind.VII.'Tis here in virtuous lore the studious fairInforms her babes, nor scorns herself t' improve,While in his smile she lives, whose pleasing careDispenses knowledge from the lips of love.VIII.No wild desires can spread their poison here,No discontent their peaceful hours attend;False joys, nor flatt'ring hopes, nor servile fear,Their gentle minds with jarring passions rend.IX.Here oft in pleasing solitude they rove,Recounting o'er the deeds of former days;With inward joy their well-spent time approve,And feel a recompence beyond all praise.X.Or in sweet converse through the grove, or nearThe fountain's birnk, or where the arbour's shadeBeats back the heat, fair Virtue's voice they hear,More musical by sweet digressions made.XI.With calm dependence every good they taste,Yet feel their neighbours' wants with kind regret,Nor cheer themselves alone (a mean repast!)But deal forth blessings round their happy seat.XII.'Tis to such virtue, that the Power SupremeThe choicest of his blessings hath design'd,And shed them plenteous over every clime,The calm delights of an untainted mind.XIII.Ere yet the sad effects of foolish pride,And mean ambition still employ'd in strife,And luxury did o'er the world preside,Deprav'd the taste, and pall'd the joys of life.XIV.For such the Spring, in richest mantle clad,Pours forth her beauties through the gay parterre:And Autumn's various bosom is o'erspreadWith all the blushing fruits that crown the year.XV.Or Summer tempts, in golden beams array'd,Which o'er the fields in borrow'd lustre glow,To meditate beneath the cooling shadeTheir happy state, and whence their blessings flow.XVI.E'en rugged Winter varies but their joy,Painting the cheek with fresh vermilion-hue;And those rough frosts which softer frames annoyWith vig'rous health their slack'ning nerves renew.XVII.From the dark bosom of the dappled MornTo Phoebus shining with meridian light,Or when mild Evening does the sky adorn,Or the pale moon rides through the spangled night;XVIII.The varying scenes in every virtuous soulEach pleasing change with various pleasures bless,Raise cheerful hopes, and anxious fears controul,And form a Paradise of inward peace.To the Right Hon. Sir ROBERT WALPOLE.—Quod censet amiculus, ut siCoecus iter monstrare velit.—HOR.By the Hon. Mr. DODINGTON, afterwards Lord MELCOMBE.THO' strength of genius, by experience taught,Gives thee to sound the depth of human thought,To trace the various workings of the mind,And rule the secret springs that rule mankind;Rare gift! yet, Walpole, wilt thou condescendTo listen, if thy unexperienc'd friendCan aught of use impart, though void of skill,And raise attention by sincere good will:For friendship sometimes want of parts supplies,The heart may furnish what the head denies.As, when the rapid Rhine o'er swelling tides,To grace old Ocean's coast, in triumph rides,Though rich in source, he drains a thousand springs,Nor scorns the tribute each small riv'let brings:So thou shalt hence absorb each feeble ray,Each dawn of meaning in thy brighter day;Shalt like, or, where thou canst not like, excuse,Since no mean interest shall prophane the Muse;No malice wrapt in truth's disguise offend,No flattery taint the freedom of a friend.When first a generous mind surveys the great,And views the crowds that on their fortune wait,Pleas'd with the shew, (though little understood,)He only seeks the power, to do the good:Thinks, till he tries, 'tis godlike to dispose,And gratitude still springs, when bounty flows;That every grant sincere affection wins,And where our wants have end, our love begins.But they who long the paths of state have trod,Learn from the clamours of the murm'ring crowd,Which cramm'd, yet craving, still their gates besiege,'Tis easier far to give, than to oblige.This of thy conduct seems the nicest part.The chief perfection of the statesman's art,To give to fair assent a fairer face,Or foften a refusal into grace.But few there are, that can be freely kind,Or know to fix the favours on the mind;Hence some whene'er they would oblige, offend,And while they make the fortune lose the friend:Still give unthank'd; still squander, not bestow;For great men want not what to give, but how.The race of men that follow courts, 'tis true,Think all they get, and more than all, their due;Still ask, but ne'er consult their own deserts,And measure by their interest, not their parts.From this mistake so many men we seeBut ill become the thing they wish to be:Hence discontent and fresh demands arise,More power, more favour in the great man's eyes:All feel a want, though none the cause suspects,But hate their patron for their own defects.Such none can please, but who reforms their hearts,And when he gives them places, gives them parts.As these o'erprize their worth, so sure the greatMay sell their favours at too dear a rate.When merit pines while clamour is preferr'd,And long attachment waits among the herd;When no distinction, where distinction's due,Marks from the many the superior few:When strong cabal constrains them to be just,And makes them give at last, because they must;What hopes that men of real worth should prizeWhat neither friendship gives, nor merit buys?The man who justly o'er the whole presides,His well-weigh'd choice with wise affection guides;Knows when to stop with grace, and when advance,Nor gives from importunity, or chance:But thinks how little gratitude is ow'd,When favours are extorted, not bestow'd.When safe on shore ourselves, we see the crowdSurround the great, importunate and loud:Through such a tumult 'tis no easy taskTo drive the man of real worth to ask;Surrounded thus, and giddy with the shew,'Tis hard for great men rightly to bestow;From hence so few are skill'd in either case,To ask with dignity, or give with grace.Sometimes the great, seduc'd by love of parts,Consult our genius, but neglect our hearts;Pleas'd with the glittering sparks that genius flings,They lift us tow'ring on the eagle's wings;Mark out the flights by which themselves begun,And teach our dazzled eyes to bear the sun,Till we forget the hand that made us great,And grow to envy, not to emulate.To emulate a generous warmth implies,To reach the virtues that make great men rise;But envy wears a mean malignant face,And aims not at their virtues, but their place.Such to oblige, how vain is the pretence!When every favour is a fresh offence,By which superior power is still imply'd,And while it helps the fortune, hurts the pride.Slight is the hate neglect or hardships breed;But those who hate from envy, hate indeed.Since so perplex'd the choice, whom shall we trust?Methinks, I hear thee cry, the brave, the just:The man by no mean fears or hopes controul'd,Who serves thee from affection, not for gold!We love the honest, and esteem the brave,Despise the coxcomb, but detest the knave.No shew of parts the truly wise seduce,To think that knaves can be of real use.The man who contradicts the public voice,And strives to dignify a worthless choice,Attempts a task that on the choice reflects,And lends us light to point out new defects.One worthless man that gains what he pretends,Disgusts a thousand unpretending friends:And since no art can make a counter pass,Or add the weight of gold to mimic brass,When princes to bad ore their image join,They more debase the stamp than raise the coin.Be thine that care, true merit to reward,And gain that good; nor will the task be hard.Souls found alike so quick by nature blend,An honest man is more than half thy friend:Him no mere views, no haste to rise, shall sway,Thy choice to sully, or thy trust betray.Ambition here shall at due distance stand;Nor is wit dangerous in an honest hand:Besides, if failings at the bottom lie,He views those failings with a lover's eye.Though small his genius, let him do his best,Our wishes and belief supply the rest:Let others barter servile faith for gold,His friendship is not to be bought or sold.Fierce opposition he unmov'd shall face,Modest in favour, daring in disgrace:To share thy adverse fate alone pretend,In power a servant, out of power a friend.Here pour thy favours in an ample flood,Indulge thy boundless thirst of doing good.Nor think that good alone to him confin'd;Such to oblige is to oblige mankind.If thus thy mighty master's steps thou trace,The brave to cherish, and the good to grace,Long shalt thou stand from rage and faction free,And teach us long to love the king and thee;Or fall a victim dangerous to the foe,And make him tremble when he strikes the blow;While honour, gratitude, affection join,To deck thy close, and brighten thy decline.Illustrious doom! the great when thus displac'd,With friendship guarded, and with virtue grac'd,In aweful ruin, like Rome's senate, fallThe prey and worship of the wond'ring Gaul.No doubt to genius some reward is due(Excluding that were satirizing you):But yet believe thy undesigning friend;When truth and genius for thy choice contend,Though both have weight, when in the balance cast,Let probity be first, and parts the last.On these foundations if thou dar'st be great,And check the growth of folly and deceit,When party rage shall drop through length of days,And calumny be ripen'd into praise,Then future times shall to thy worth allowThat fame, which envy would call flattery now,Thus far my zeal, though for the task unfit,Has pointed out the rocks where others split:By that inspir'd, though stranger to the Nine,And negligent of any fame but thine,I take that friendly, but superfluous part,That acts from nature what I teach from art.To a LADY on a LANDSCAPE of her Drawing.By Mr. PARROT.BEHOLD the magic of Theresa's hand!A new creation blooms at her command.Touch'd into life the vivid colours glow,Catch the warm stream, and quicken as they flow.The ravish'd sight the pleasing landscape fills,Here sink the valleys, and there rise the hills.Not with more horror nods bleak Calpe's Gibraltar. height,Than here the pictur'd rock astounds the sight.Not Thames more devious-winding leaves his source,Than here the wand'ring rivers shape their course.Obliquely lab'ring runs the gurgling rill;Still murm'ring runs, or seems to murmur still.An aged oak, with hoary moss o'erspread,Here lifts aloft its venerable head;There overshadowing hangs a sacred wood,And nods inverted in the neighb'ring flood.Each tree as in its native forest shoots,And blushing bends with Autumn's golden fruits.Thy pencil lends the rose a lovelier hue,And gives the lily fairer to our view.Here fruits and flow'rs adorn the varied year,And paradise with all its sweets is here.There stooping to its fall a tow'r appears,With tempests shaken, and a weight of years.The daified meadow, and the woodland green,In order rise, and fill the various scene.Some parts, in light magnificently dress'd,Obtrusive enter, and stand all confess'd;Whilst others decently in shades are thrown,And by concealing make their beauties known.Alternate thus, and mutual is their aid,The lights owe half their lustre to the shade.So the bright fires that light the milky way,Lost and extinguish'd in the solar ray;In the sun's absence pour a flood of light,And borrow all their brightness from the night.To cheat our eyes, how well dost thou contrive!Each object here seems real and alive.Not more resembling life the figures stand,Form'd by Lysippus, or by Phidias' hand.Unnumber'd beauties in the piece unite,Rush on the eye, and crowd upon the sight;At once our wonder and delight you raise,We view with pleasure, and with rapture praise.ODE to CUPID on VALENTINE'S Day.BY THE SAME.COME, thou rosy-dimpled boy,Source of every heart-felt joy,Leave the blissful bow'rs awhile,Paphos and the Cyprian isle:Visit Britain's rocky shore,Britons too thy pow'r adore;Britons hardy, bold, and free,Own thy laws, and yield to thee.Source of every heart-felt joy,Come, thou rosy-dimpled boy.Haste to Sylvia, haste away:This is thine, and Hymen's day.Bid her thy soft bondage wear,Bid her for Love's rites prepare.Let the nymphs with many a flowerDeck the sacred nuptial bower.Thither lead the lovely fair;And let Hymen too be there.This is thine, and Hymen's day:Haste to Sylvia, haste away.Only while we love, we live;Love alone can pleasure give.Pomp and power, and tinsel state,Those false pageants of the great,Crowns and scepters, envied things,And the pride of Eastern kings,Are but childish empty toys,When compar'd to Love's sweet joys.Love alone can pleasure give:Only while we love, we live.To the Worthy, Humane, Generous, Reverend, and Noble, Mr. FREDERICK CORNWALLIS, now Archbishop of CANTERBURY.By Dr. SNEYD DAVIES. Written in the Year 1743.IN frolic's hour, ere serious thought had birth,There was a time, my dear Cornwallis, whenFancy would take me on her airy wingAnd waft to views romantic; there displaySome motley vision, shade and sun: the cliff,O'erhanging sparkling brooks and ruins grey,Bade me meanders trace, and catch the formOf varying clouds, and rainbows learn to paint.Sometimes ambition, brushing by, would twitchMy spirits, and with winning look sublimeAllure to follow. What though steep the track,Her mountain's top would overpay, when climb'd,The scaler's toil; her temple there was fine,And lovely thence the prospects. She could tellWhere laurels grew, whence many a wreath antique;But more advis'd to shun the barren twig,(What is immortal verdure without fruit?)And woo some thriving art: her num'rous minesWere open to the searcher's skill and pains.Caught by th' harangue, heart beat, and flutt'ring pulse,Sounded irregular marches, to be gone—What, pause a moment when Ambition calls!No, the blood gallops to the distant goal,And throbs to reach it. Let the lame sit still.When Fortune gentle, at the hill's verge extreme,Array'd in decent robe, and plain attire,Smiling approach'd; and what occasion ask'dOf climbing? She already providentHad cater'd well, if stomach could digestHer viands, and a palate not too nice.Unfit she said, for perilous attempt,That manly limb requir'd, and sinews tough.She took, and lay'd me in a vale remote,Amid the gloomy scene of fir and yew,On apple ground; where Morpheus strew'd the bed:Obscurity her curtain round me drew,And syren Sloth a dull quietus sung.Sithence no fairy sights, no quick'ning ray,No stir of pulse, nor objects to enticeAbroad the spirits; but the cloyster'd heartSits squat at home, like pagod in a nitchDemure; or grandees with nod-watching eye,And folded arms, in presence of the throne,Turk, or Indostan—Cities, forums, courts,And prating sanhedrims, and drumming wars,Affect no more than stories told to bedLethargic, which at intervals the sickHears and forgets, and wakes to doze again.Instead of converse and variety,The same trite round, the same stale silent scene:Such are thy comforts, blessed Solitude!But Innocence is there, but Peace all kind,And simple Quiet with her downy couch,Meads lowing, tune of birds, and lapse of streams;And Saunter with a book; and warbling Muse,In praise of hawthorns.—Life's whole business this!Is it to bask i' th' sun? if so, a snailWere happy crawling on a southern wall.Why sits Content upon a cottage sillAt even-tide; and blesseth the coarse mealIn sooty corner? why sweet slumbers waitTh' hard pallet? not because from haunt remote,Sequester'd in a dingle's bushy lap:'Tis labour makes the peasant's sav'ry fare,And works out his repose: for ease must askThe leave of diligence to be enjoy'd.Oh! listen not to that enchantress EaseWith seeming smile; her palatable cupBy standing grows insipid; and bewarePerdition, for there's poison in the lees.What health impair'd, and crowds inactive maim'd!What daily martyrs to her sluggish cause!Less strict devoir the Russ and Persian claimDespotic; and, as subjects long inur'dTo servile burden, grow supine and tame:—So fares it with our sov'reign, and her train.What tho' with lure fallacious she pretendFrom worldly bondage to set free; what gainHer votaries? What avails from iron chainsExempt, if rosy fetters bind as fast?Bestir, and answer your creation's end.Think we that man with vig'rous pow'r endow'd,And room to stretch, was destin'd to sit still?Sluggards are Nature's rebels, slight her laws,Nor live up to the terms on which they holdTheir vital lease. Laborious terms and hard!But such the tenure of our earthly state!Riches and fame are Industry's reward;The nimble runner courses Fortune down,And then he banquets, for she feeds the bold.Think what you owe your country, what yourself.If splendor charm not, yet avoid the scornThat treads on lowly stations. Think of someAffiduous booby mounting o'er your head,And thence with saucy grandeur looking down:Think of (Reflection's stab!) the pitying friendWith shoulder shrugg'd, and sorry. Think that TimeHas golden minutes, if discreetly seiz'd:And if some sad example, indolent,To warn and scare be wanting—think of me.TO HIS FRIEND AND NEIGHBOUR DR. THOMAS TAYLOR. 1744.BY THE SAME.—FRench pow'r, and weak allies, and war, and want—No more of that, my friend; you touch a stringThat hurts my ear. All politics apart,Except a gen'rous wish, a glowing pray'rFor British welfare, commerce, glory, peace.Give party to the winds: it is a word,A phantom sound, by which the cunning greatWhistle to their dependents: a decoy,To gull th' unwary: where the master standsEncouraging his minions, his train'd birds,Fed and caress'd, their species to betray.See, with what hollow blandishment and artThey lead the winged captives to the snare;Fools! that in open aether might have soar'd,Free as the air they cut; sipt purest rills;Din'd with the Thames, or bath'd in crystal lakes.Heav'n knows, it is not insolence that speaks!The tribute of respect, to greatness due,Not the brib'd sycophant more willing pays.Still, still as much of party be retain'd,As principle requires, and sense directs;Else our vain bark, without a rudder, floats,The scorn and pastime of each veering gale.This gentle evening let the sun descendUntroubled; while it paints your ambient hillsWith faded lustre, and a sweet farewell:Here is our seat. That A castle belonging to the Earl of Oxford. castle opposite,Proud of its woody crest, adorns the scene.Dictate, O vers'd in books, and just of taste,Dictate the pleasing theme of our discourse.Shall we trace science from her Eastern homeChaldean? or the banks of Nile? where Thebes,Nursing her daughter arts, majestic stood,And pour'd forth knowledge from an hundred gates.There first the marble learn'd to mimic form;The pillar'd temple rose; and pyramids,Whose undecaying grandeur laughs at Time.Birth-place of letters; where the sun was shewnHis radiant way, and heavens were taught to roll.There too the Muses tun'd their earliest lyre,Warbling soft numbers to Serapis' ear;'Till, chas'd by tyrants, or a milder climeInviting, they remov'd with pilgrim harp,And all their band of melody to Greece.As when a flock of linnets, if perchanceDeliver'd from the falcon's talon, flyWith trembling wing to covert, and their notesRenew, tell every bush of their escape,And trill their merry thanks to Liberty.The tuneful tribe, pleas'd with their new abode,Polish'd the rude inhabitants; whence talesOf list'ning woods, and rocks that danc'd to sound,Hear the full chorus lifting hymns to Jove!Linus and Orpheus catch the strain; and allThe raptur'd audience utter loud applause!A song, believe me, was no trifle Then:Weighty the Muse's task, and wide her sway:Her's was Religion; the resounding FanesEcho'd her language; Polity was her's;And the world bow'd to legislative verse.As states increas'd, and governments were form'd,Her aid less useful, she retir'd to grotsAnd shady bow'rs, content to teach and please.Under her laurel frequent bards repos'd;Voluble Pindar troll'd his rapid song,And Sappho breath'd her spirited complaint.Hence sprung the tragic rage, the lyric charm,And Homer's genuine thunder.—Happy Greece!Bless'd in her offspring! Seat of eloquence,Of arms and reason; patriot-virtue's seat!Did the sun thither dart uncommon rays!Did some presiding genius hover o'erThat animated soil with brooding wings!The sad reverse might start a gentle tear.Go, search for Athens; her deserted portsEnter, a noiseless solitary shore,Where commerce crouded the Piraean strand.Trace her dark streets, her wall-embarrass'd shrinesWheeler's Travels, p. 346, 347, 380, 300.;And pensive wonder, where her glories beam'd.Where are her orators, her sages, now?—Shatter'd her mould'ring arcs, her tow'rs in dust,—But far less ruin'd, than her soul decay'd.The stone, inscrib'd to Socrates, debas'dTo prop a reeling cot.—Minerva's domePossess'd by those, who never kiss'd her shield.—Upon the mount where old Musaeus sung,Sits the gruff turban'd captain, and exactsHarsh tribute!—In the grove, where Plato taughtHis polish'd strain sublime, a stupid TurkIs preaching ignorance and Mahomet.(Where HeDemosthene., whom only dauntless Philip fear'd,Shook the astonish'd throng;— here holy PaulHarangu'd the Pagan multitude, and broughtTo staring human wisdom news from heav'n.)Turn next to Rome:—Is that the clime, the place,Where, on his laurel'd throne, with tuneful choirsOf arts surrounded, great Augustus reign'd?And (greater far) the venerable bandOf elder heroes (fame's eternal theme!)In splendid huts, and noble poverty,Brave for their country liv'd, and fought, and died.Heav'n! what firm Souls! who knew not gold had price,Nor perfidy, nor baseness knew.—They, they,The demi-gods of Rome! whose master voice,Whose awe-commanding eye, more terror struck,Than rods, and lictors, and Praetorian bands.Could the pure crimson tide, the noblest blood,In all the world, to such pollution turn:Like Jordan's river, pouring his clear floodInto the black Asphaltus' slimy lake?Patrons of wit, and victors of mankind,Bards, warriors, worthies, (revolution strange!)Are pimps, and fidlers, mountebanks, and monks.In Tully's hive, rich magazine of sweets!The lazy drones are buzzing, or asleep.But we forgive the living for the dead;Indebted more to Rome than we can pay:Of a long dearth prophetic, she laid inA feast for ages.—O thou banquet nice!Where the soul riots with secure excess.What heart-felt bliss! what pleasure-winged hoursTransported owe we to her-letter'd sons!—We, by their favour, Tyber's banks enjoy,Their temples trace, and share their noble games;Enter the crowded theatre at will;March to the forum; hear the consul plead;Are present in the thund'ring CapitolWhen Tully speaks.—At softer hours, attendHarmonious Virgil to his Mantuan farm,Or Baia's shore:—how often drink his strains,Rural, or epic, sweet!—how often roveWith Horace, bard and moralist benign!With happy Horace rove, in fragrant pathsOf myrtle bowers, by Tivoli's cascade.Hail, precious pages! that amuse and teach,Exalt the genius, and improve the breast.Ye sage historians, all your stores unfold,Reach your clear steady mirror;—in that glassThe forms of good and ill are well pourtray'd.But chiefly thou, supreme Philosophy!Shed thy blest influence; with thy train appearOf graces mild: far be the Stoic boast,The Cynics snarl, and churlish pedantry.Bright visitant, if not too high my wish,Come in the lovely dress you wore, a guestAt Plato's table; or in studious walks,In green Frescati's academic groves,The Roman feasting his selected friends.Tamer of pride! at thy serene rebukeSee crouching insolence, spleen, and revengeBefore thy shining taper disappear.Tutor of human life! auspicious guide!Whose faithful clue unravels every maze:Whose skill can disengage the tangled thorn,And smooth the rock to down! whose magic powersControul each storm, and bid the roar be still.VACATION.By —, Esq.HENCE sage, mysterious Law,That sitt'st with rugged brow, and crabbed lookO'er thy black-letter'd book,And the night-watching student strik'st with awe;Away with thy dull train,Slow-pac'd Advice, Surmise, and squint-ey'd Doubt;Dwell with the noisy routOf busy men, 'mid cities and throng'd halls,Where Clamour ceaseless bawls,And Enmity and Strife thy state sustain.But on me thy blessings pour,Sweet Vacation. Thee, of yore,In all her youth and beauty's prime,Summer bore to aged Time,As he one sunny morn beheld herTending a field of corn: the elderThere 'mid poppies red and blue,Unsuspected nearer drew,And, with softly-sliding paceHast'ning to a stol'n embrace,Fill'd her with thee; and joy and mirthHung on thy auspicious birth.Come, sweet goddess; full of play,Ever unconfin'd and gay,Bring the leisure Hours with theeLeading on the Graces threeDancing; nor let aught detainThe Holidays, a smiling train:Whose fair brows let Peace sereneCrown with olive-branches green.Bring too Health with ruddy cheek,Lively air, and count'nance sleek,Attended, as she's wont to be,With all her jolly companyOf exercises, chace, and flight,Active strength, and cunning sleight,Nimble feats, and playful bouts,Leaps of joy▪ and cheerful shouts,Tricks and pranks, and sports and gamesSuch as youthful Fancy frames.And, O kind goddess, add to theseCheerful Content, and placid Ease;Not her who fondly fitteth near,Dull Indolence in elbow'd chair;But Ease who aids th' harmonious Nine,Tuning their instruments divine,And without whom, in lofty strain,Phoebus' client tries in vainTo raise the feeble voice aboveThe crowd, and catch the ear of Jove.And do thou, Vacation, deignTo let me pass among thy train;So may I, thy vot'ry true,All thy flow'ry paths pursue,Pleased still with thee to meetIn some friendly rural seat;Where I gladsome oft' surveyNature in her best array,Woods and lawns and lakes between,Fields of corn and hedges green,Fallow grounds of tawny hue,Distant hills, and mountains blue;On whose ridge far off appearsA wood (the growth of many years)Of aweful oak, or gloomy pine,Above th' horizon's level lineRising black: such those of oldWhere British druids wont to holdSolemn assemblies, and to keepTheir rites, unfolding myst'ries deep,Such that fam'd Dodona's grove,Sacred to prophetic Jove.Oft I admire the verdant steep,Spotted white with many a sheep,While, in pastures rich belowAmong the grazing cattle, slowMoves the bull with heavy treadHanging down his lumpish head,And the proud steed neigheth oft'Shaking his wanton mane aloft.Or, traversing the wood about,The jingling packhorse-bells remoteI hear, amid the noontide stillness,Sing through the air with brassy shrillness;What time the waggon's cumbrous loadGrates along the grav'lly road:There onward, dress'd in homely guise,Some unregarded maiden hies.Unless by chance a trav'lling 'squire,Of base intent and foul desire,Stops to insnare, with speech beguiling,Sweet innocence and beauty smiling.Nor fail I joyful to partakeThe lively sports of country wake,Where many a lad and many a lassFoot it on the close-trod grass.There nimble Marian of the greenMatchless in the jig is seen,Allow'd beyond compare by allThe beauty of the rustic ball:While the tripping damsels near,Stands a lout with waggish leer;He, if Marian chance to shewHer taper leg and stocking blue,Winks and nods and laughs aloud,Among the merry-making crowd,Utt'ring forth, in aukward jeer,Words unmeet for virgin's ear.Soon as ev'ning clouds have shedTheir wat'ry store on earth's soft bed,And through their flowing mantles thin,Clear azure spots of sky are seen,I quit some oak's close-cover'd bow'r,To taste the boon of new-fall'n show'r,To pace the corn-field's grassy edgeClose by a fresh-blown sweet-briar hedge;While at every green leaf's endPearly drops of rain depend,And an earthy fragrance 'roundRises from the moisten'd ground.Sudden a sun-beam darting out,Brightens the landskip all about,With yellow light the grove o'erspreads,And tips with gold the haycocks' heads:Then as mine eye is eastward led,Some fair castle rears its head,Whose height the country round commands,Well known mark to distant lands,There the windows glowing brightBlaze from afar with ruddy light,Borrow'd from clouds of scarlet dye,Just as the sun hath left the sky.But if chill Eurus cut the airWith keener wing, I then repairTo park or woodland, shelter meet,Near some noble's ancient seat,Where long winding walks are seenStately oaks and elms between,Whose arms promiscuous form aboveHigh over-arch'd a green alcove;While the hoarse-voic'd hungry rookNear her stick-built nest doth croak,Waving on the topmast bough;And the master stag belowBellows loud with savage roar,Stalking all his hinds before.Thus musing, night with even paceSteals on, o'ershad'wing nature's face;While the bat with dusky wingsFlutters round in giddy rings,And the buzzing chaffers comeClose by mine ear with solemn hum.Homeward now my steps I guideSome rising grassy bank beside,Studded thick with sparks of lightIssuing from many a glow-worm bright;While village-cur with minute barkAlarms the pilf'rer in the dark,Save what light the stars convey,Cluster'd in the milky way,Or scatter'd numberless on highTwinkling all o'er the boundless sky.Then within doors let me meetThe viol touch'd by finger neat,Or, soft symphonies amongWrap me in the sacred song,Attun'd by Handel's matchless skill,While Attention mute and stillFixes all my soul to hearThe voice harmonious, sweet and clear.Nor let smooth-tongu'd Converse fail,With many a well-devised tale,And stories link'd, to twist a chainThat may awhile old Time detain,And make him rest upon his scythePleas'd to see the hours so blithe:While, with sweet attractive grace,The beauteous housewife of the placeWins the heart of every guestBy courteous deeds, and all contestWhich shall readiest homage shewTo such sov'reign sweetness due.These delights, Vacation, give,And I with thee will choose to live.To a LADY very handsome, but too fond of DRESS.BY THE SAME.PRYTHEE why so fantastic and vain?What charms can the toilet supply?Why so studious, admirers to gain?Need beauty lay traps for the eye?Because that thy breast is so fair,Must thy tucker be still setting right?And canst thou not laughing forbear,Because that thy teeth are so white?Shall sovereign beauty descendTo act so ignoble a part?Whole hours at the looking-glass spend,A slave to the dictates of art?And cannot thy heart be at restUnless thou excellest each fairIn trinkets and trumpery dress'd?Is not that a superfluous care?Vain, idle attempt! to pretendThe lily with whiteness to deck!Does the rich solitaire recommendThe delicate turn of thy neck?The glossy bright hue of thy hairCan powder or jewels adorn?Can perfumes or vermillions compareWith the breath or the blush of the morn?When, embarrass'd with baubles and toys,Thou'rt set out so enormously fine,Over-doing thy purpose destroys,And to please thou hast too much design:Little know'st thou, how beauty beguiles,How alluring the innocent eye;What sweetness in natural smiles,And what charms in simplicity lie.Thee Nature with beauty has clad,With genuine ornaments dress'd;Nor can Art an embellishment addTo set off what already is best:Be it thine, self-accomplish'd to reign:Bid the toilet be far set apart,And dismiss with an honest disdainThat impertinent Abigail, Art.ANACREON. ODE III. Translated by the Same.IN the dead of the night, when with labour oppress'dAll mortals enjoy the calm blessing of rest,Cupid knock'd at my door; I awoke with a noise,And "who is it (I call'd) that my sleep thus destroys?""You need not be frighten'd, he answered mild,"Let me in; I'm a little unfortunate child;"'Tis a dark rainy night; and I'm wet to the skin;"And my way I have lost; and do, pray, let me in."I was mov'd with compassion; and striking a light,I open'd the door; when a boy stood in sight,Who had wings on his shoulders; the rain from him dripp'd;With a bow and with arrows too he was equipp'd.I stirr'd up my fire, and close by its sideI set him down by me: with napkins I dried,I chaf'd him all over, kept out the cold air,And I wrung with my hands the wet out of his hair.He from wet and from cold was no sooner at ease,But taking his bow up, he said, "If you please"We will try it; I would by experiment know"If the wet hath not damag'd the string of my bow."Forthwith from his quiver an arrow he drew,To the string he apply'd it, and twang went the yew;The arrow was gone; in my bosom it center'd:No sting of a hornet more sharp ever enter'd.Away skipp'd the urchin, as brisk as a bee,And laughing, "I wish you much joy, friend, quoth he:"My bow is undamag'd, for true went the dart;"But you will have trouble enough with your heart."An Imitation of HORACE, Book III. Ode 2. Angustam amice, &c.By Mr. TITLEYWalter Titley, Esq afterwards resident at the court of Denmark., to Dr. BENTLEY.HE that would great in science grow,By whom bright Virtue is ador'd,At first must be content to knowAn humble roof, an homely board.With want and rigid college lawsLet him, inur'd betimes, comply;Firm to religion's sacred cause,The learned combat let him try;Let him her envied praises tell,And all his eloquence discloseThe fierce endeavours to repel,And still the tumult of her foes.Him early form'd, and season'd young,Subtle opposers soon will fear,And tremble at his artful tongue,Like Parthians at the Roman spear.Grim death, th' inevitable lotWhich fools and cowards strive to fly,Is with a noble pleasure soughtBy him who dares for truth to die.With purest lustre of her ownExalted Virtue ever shines,Nor, as the vulgar smile or frown,Advances now, and now declines.A glorious and immortal prize,She on her hardy son bestows,She shews him heaven, and bids him rise,Though pain, and toil, and death oppose:With lab'ring flight he wings th' obstructed way,Leaving both common souls and common clay.A Reply to a Copy of Verses made in Imitation of Book III.

Dr. LISLEDr. Thomas Lisle, son of Edward Lisle, Esq of Crux-Easton, in Hampshire. He was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he took the degree of M. A. June 23, 1732; B. D. November 28, 1740; and D. D. April 22, 1743. He was at the time of his death, 27th March, 1767, rector of Burclere, in the county of Hants..WHEN Phoebus's beams are withdrawn from our sight,We admire his fair sister, the regent of night;Though languid her beauty, though feeble her ray,Yet still she's akin to the God of the day.When Susan, like Cynthia, has finish'd her reign,Then Charlotte, like Phoebus, shall shine out again.As Catholic bigots fall humble beforeThe pictures of those whom in heart they adore,Which though known to be nothing but canvass and paint,Yet are said to enliven their zeal to the saint;So to Susan I bow, charming Charlotte, for sheHas just beauty enough to remind me of thee.Inconstant and faithless in love's the pretenceOn which you arraign me: pray hear my defence:Such censures as these to my credit redound;I acknowledge, and thank a good appetite for't:When ven'son and claret are not to be found,I can make a good meal upon mutton and port.Tho' The seat of the Hon. R. Herbert. Highclear's so fine that a prince would not scorn it,Though nature and taste have combin'd to adorn it;Yet the artist that owns it would think it severe,Were a law made to keep him there all round the year.How enrag'd would the rector of Wotton, the author's parish in the Isle of Wight. Boscoville look,If the king should enjoin him to read but one book!And how would his audience their fortune bemoan,If he gave them no sermons but what were his own!'Tis variety only makes appetite last,And by changing our dishes we quicken our taste.To VENUS.

Die, for thy undoing.What saw we on Sicilian ground?(A soil in ancient verse renown'd.)The self-same spot, or Virgil ly'd,On which the good Anchises dy'd:The fields where Ceres' daughter sported,And where the pretty Cyclops courted.The nymph, hard-hearted as the rocks,Refus'd the monster, scorn'd his flocks,And took a shepherd in his stead,With nought but love and mirth to plead;An instance of a generous mindThat does much honour to your kind,But in an age of fables grew,So possibly it mayn't be true.While on the summit Aetna glows,His shivering sides are chill'd with snows.Beneath, the painted landskip charms;Here infant Spring in Winter's armsWantons secure: in youthful prideStands Summer laughing by her side;Ev'n Autumn's yellow robes appear,And one gay scene discloses all the year.Hence to rude Cerigo we came,Known once by Cytherea's name;When Ocean first the goddess bore,She roe on this distinguish'd shore.Here first the happy Paris stopp'd,When Helen from her lord elop'd.With pleas'd reflection I survey'dEach secret grott, each conscious shade;Envy'd his choice, approv'd his flame,And fondly wish'd my lot the same.O were the cause reviv'd again!For charming Queensbury liv'd not then,The radiant fruit, had she been there,Would scarce have fall'n to Venus' share;Saturnia's sel had wav'd her claim,And modest Pallas blush'd for shame;All had been right: the Phrygian swainHad sigh'd for her, but figh'd in vain;The fair Oenone joy'd to findThe pains she felt repaid in kind;No rape reveng'd, no room for strife,Atrides might have kept his wife,Old Troy in peace and plenty smil'd—But the Iliad. best poem had been spoil'd.How did my heart with joy run o'er,When to the fam'd Cecropian shore,Wafted by gentle breezes, weCame gliding through the smooth still sea!While backward rov'd my busy thoughtOn deeds in distant ages wrought;On tyrants gloriously withstood;On seas distain'd with Persian blood;On trophies rais'd o'er hills of stainIn Marathon's unrival'd plain.Then, as around I cast my eye,And view'd the pleasing prospect nigh,The land for arms and arts renown'd,Where wit was honour'd, poets crown'd;Whose manners and whose rules refin'dOur souls, and civiliz'd mankind;Or (yet a loftier pitch to raiseOur wonder, and complete its praise)The land that Socrates. Plato's master bore—How did my heart with joy run o'er!Now coasting on the eastern side,We peep'd where Peneus rolls his tide:Where Arethusa came t' appeaseThe shepherd that had lost his bees,And led him to Cyrene's grott;'Tis a long tale, and matters not.Dryden will tell you all that past;See Virgil's Georgics, book the last.I speak on't, but to let you knowThis grott still stands in statu quo;Of which, if any doubt remain,I've proof, as follows, clear and plain.Here, sisters, we such honours met!Such honours I shall ne'er forget.The Goddess (no uncommon case),Proud, I suppose, to shew her place,Or piqu'd perhaps at your renown,Sent Boreas to invite us down;And he so press'd it, that we us'dSome pains to get ourselves excus'd.My brother shipmates, all in haste,Declar'd, that shells were not their taste;And I had At Crux-Easton. somewhere seen, you know,A finer grott than she could shew.Hence let the Muse to Delos roam,Or Nio, fam'd for Homer's tomb;To Naxos, known in ancient timeFor Bacchus' love, for Theseus' crime.Can she the Lesbian vine forgetWhence Horace reinforc'd his wit?Where the fam'd harp Arion strung,Nor play'd more sweet than Sappho sung?Could the old bards revive again,How would they mourn th' inverted scene!Scarce with the barren waste acquainted,They once so beautifully painted.And here, 'twixt friends, I needs must say,But let it go no farther, pray,These sung-up, cry'd-up countries areDispleasing, rugged, black, and bare▪And all I've yet beheld or knownServe only to endear my own.The matters I shall next disclose,'Tis likely, may be wrapp'd in prose;But verse methought would suit these better,Besides, it lengthens out my letter.Read then, dear girls, with kind regard,What comes so far, what comes so hard;And to our mother too make known,How travelling has improv'd her son.Let not malicious critics joinPope's homespun rhymes in rank with mine,Form'd on that very spot of earth,Where Homer's self receiv'd his birth;Add, as I said, t' enhance their worth,The pains they cost in bringing forth;While his, as all mankind agrees,Though wrote with care, are wrote with ease.Part of a LETTER to my Sisters at CRUX-EASTON, written from CAIRO in EGYPT, August 1734.BY THE SAME.WHILE you, my dear girls, in your paradise stray,Diverting with innocent freedom the day,I wander alone in a barbarous land,Half bak'd by the sun, half blind by the sand.Then your wood too and grotto so swim in my sight,They give me no respite by day nor by night;No sooner asleep but I'm dreaming of you;I am just wak'd from one,—would to God it were true.Methought I was now a fine gentleman grown,And had got, Lord knows how, an estate of my own.Good-bye to plain Tom, I was rais'd a peg higher;Some call'd me his worship, and others the squire.'Twas a place, I remember, exactly like Easton,A scene for an emperor's fancy to feast on.There I built a fine house with great cost and great care,(Your la'ships have form'd many such in the air)Not of stucco, nor brick, but as good Portland stoneAs Kent The painter and architect. would desire to be working upon.The apartments not small, nor monstrously great,But chiefly for use, and a little for state;So begilt, and becarv'd, and with ornaments grac'd,That every one said, I'd an excellent taste.Here I liv'd like a king, never hoarded my pelf,Kept a coach for my sisters, a nag for myself,With something that's good when our Highclear friends come,And, spite of 'squire Herbert, a fire in each room.A canal made for profit as well as for pleasure,That's about, let me see, two acres in measure;Both the eye to delight, and the table to crown,With a jack, or a perch, when my uncles come down.An exceeding great wood, that's been set a great while,In length near a league, and in breadth near a mile.There every dear girl her bright genius displays,In a thousand fine whimsies a thousand fine ways.O how charming the walks to my fancy appear!What a number of temples and grottos are here!My soul was transported to such an extreme,That I leap'd up in raptures,—when lo! 'twas a dream.Then vexing I chid the impertinent dayFor driving so sweet a delusion away.Thus spectres arise, as by nurse-maids we're told,And hie to the place where they buried their gold:There hov'ring around until morning remain;Then sadly return to their torments again.LETTER from MARSEILLES to my Sisters at CRUX-EASTON, May 1735.BY THE SAME.SCENE, the Study at Crux-Easton. Molly and Fanny are sitting at work; enter to them Harriot in a passion.HARRIOT.LORD! sister, here's the butcher come,And not one word from brother Tom;The punctual spark, that made his boastHe'd write by every other post!That ever I was so absurd▪To take a man upon his word!Quoth Frances, Child, I wonder muchYou could expect him to keep touch:'Tis so, my dear, with all mankind;When out of sight you're out of mind.Think you he'd to his sisters write?Was ever girl so unpolite!Some fair Italian stands possess'd,And reigns sole mistress in his breast;To her he dedicates his time,And fawns in prose, or sighs in rhyme.She'll give him tokens of her love,Perhaps not easy to remove;Such as will make him large amendsFor loss of sisters, and of friends.Cries Harriot, When he comes to France,I hope in God he'll learn to dance,And leave his aukward habits there,I'm sure he has enough to spare.O could he leave his faults, saith Fanny,And bring the good alone, if any,Poor brother Tom! he'd grow so light,The wind might rob us of him quite!Of habits he may well get clear;Ill humours are the faults I fear,For in my life I ne'er saw yetA creature half so passionate.Good heav'ns! how did he rave and tear,On my not going you know where;I scarcely yet have got my dread off:I thought he'd bite my sister's head off.'Tween him and Jenny what a clatterAbout a fig, a mighty matter!I could recount a thousand more,But scandal's what I most abhor.Molly, who long had patient sat,And heard in silence all their chat,Observing how they spoke with rancour,Took up my cause, for which I thank her.What eloquence was then display'd!The charming things that Molly said,Perhaps it suits not me to tell;But faith! she spoke extremely well.She first, with much ado, put onA prudish face, then thus begun.Heyday! quoth she, you let your tongueRun on most strangely, right or wrong.'Tis what I never can connive at;Besides, consider whom you drive at;A person of establish'd credit,Nobody better, though I say it.In all that's good, so tried and known,Why, girls, he's quite a proverb grown,His worth no mortal dares dispute:Then he's your brother too to boot.At this she made a moment's pause,Then with a sigh resum'd the cause.Alas! my dears, you little knowA sailor's toil, a trav'ler's woe;Perhaps this very hour he straysA lonely wretch through desart ways;Or shipwreck'd on a foreign strand,He falls beneath some ruffian's hand:Or on the naked rock he lies,And pinch'd by famine wastes and dies.Can you this hated brother seeFloating, the sport of wind and sea?Can you his feeble accents hear,Though but in thought, nor drop a tear?He faintly strives, his hopes are fled,The billows booming o'er his head;He mounts upon the waves again,He calls on us, but calls in vain;To death preserves his friendship true,And mutters out a kind adieu.See now he rises to our sight,Now sinks in everlasting night.Here Fanny's colour rose and fell,And Harriot's throat began to swell:One sidled to the window quite,Pretending some unusual sight,The other left the room outright;While Molly laugh'd, her ends obtain'd,To think how artfully she feign'd.The HISTORY of PORSENNA, King of RUSSIA. IN TWO BOOKS.BY THE SAME.Arva, beataPetamus arma, divites et insulas.HOR. Epod. 16.BOOK I.IN Russia's frozen clime some ages sinceThere dwelt, historians say, a worthy prince,Who to his people's good confin'd his care,And fix'd the basis of his empire there;Inlarg'd their trade, the lib'ral arts improv'd,Made nations happy, and himself belov'd;To all the neighb'ring states a terror grown,The dear delight, and glory of his own.Not like those kings, who vainly seek renown,From countries ruin'd, and from battles won;Those mighty Nimrods, who mean laws despise,Call murder but a princely exercise,And, if one bloodless sun should steal away,Cry out with Titus, they have lost a day;Who, to be more than men, themselves debaseBeneath the brute, their Maker's form deface,Raising their titles by their God's disgrace.Like fame to bold Erostratus we give,Who scorn'd by less than sacrilege to live;On holy ruins rais'd a lasting name,And in the temple's fire diffus'd his shame.Far diff'rent praises, and a brighter fame,The virtues of the young Porsenna claim;For by that name the Russian king was known,And sure a nobler ne'er adorn'd the throne.In war he knew the deathful sword to wield,And sought the thickest dangers of the field,A bold commander; but, the storm o'erblown,He seem'd as he were made for peace alone;Then was the golden age again restor'd,Nor less his justice honour'd than his sword.All needless pomp, and outward grandeur spar'd,The deeds that grac'd him were his only guard;No private views beneath a borrow'd name;His and the public interest were the same.In wealth and pleasure let the subject live,But virtue is the king's prerogative;Porsenna there without a rival stood,And would maintain his right of doing good.Nor did his person less attraction wear,Such majesty and sweetness mingled there;Heav'n with uncommon art the clay refin'd,A proper mansion for so fair a mind;Each look, each action bore peculiar grace,And love itself was painted on his face.In peaceful time he suffer'd not his mindTo rust in sloth, though much to peace inclin'd;Nor wanton in the lap of pleasure lay,And, lost to glory, loiter'd life away:But active rising ere the prime of day,Through woods and lonely desarts lov'd to stray;With hounds and horns to wake the furious bear,Or rouze the tawny lion from his laire;To rid the forest of the savage brood,And whet his courage for his country's good.One day, as he pursued the dang'rous sport,Attended by the nobles of his court,It chanc'd a beast of more than common speedSprang from the brake, and through the desart fled.The ardent prince, impetuous as the wind,Rush'd on, and left his lagging train behind.Fir'd with the chace, and full of youthful blood,O'er plains, and vales, and woodland wilds he rode,Urging his courser's speed, nor thought the dayHow wasted, nor how intricate the way;Nor, 'till the night in dusky clouds came on,Restrain'd his pace, or found himself alone.Missing his train, he strove to measure backThe road he came, but could not find the track;Still turning to the place he left before,And only lab'ring to be lost the more.The bugle horn, which o'er his shoulders hung,So loud he winded, that the forest rung;In vain, no voice but Echo from the ground,And vocal woods make mock'ry of the sound.And now the gath'ring clouds began to spreadO'er the dun face of night a deeper shade;And the hoarse thunder, growling from afar,With herald voice proclaim'd th' approaching war;Silence awhile ensu'd,—then by degreesA hollow wind came mutt'ring through the trees.Sudden the full-fraught sky discharg'd its store,Of rain and rattling hail a mingled shower;The active lightning ran along the ground;The fiery bolts by fits were hurl'd around,And the wide forests trembled at the sound.Amazement seiz'd the prince;—where could he fly?No guide to lead, no friendly cottage nigh.Pensive and unresolv'd awhile he stood,Beneath the scanty covert of the wood;But drove from thence soon sallied forth again,As chance directed, on the dreary plain;Constrain'd his melancholy way to takeThrough many a loathsome bog, and thorny brake,Caught in the thicket, flound'ring in the lake.Wet with the storm, and wearied with the way,By hunger pinch'd, himself to beasts a prey;Nor wine to cheer his heart, nor fire to burn,Nor place to rest, nor prospect to return.Drooping and spiritless, at life's despair,He bade it pass, not worth his farther care;When suddenly he spied a distant light,That faintly twinkled through the gloom of night,And his heart leap'd for joy, and bless'd the welcome sight.Oft-times he doubted, it appear'd so far,And hung so high, 'twas nothing but a star,Or kindled vapour wand'ring through the sky,But still press'd on his steed, still kept it in his eye;'Till, much fatigue and many dangers past,At a huge mountain he arriv'd at last.There, lighting from his horse, on hands and kneesGrop'd out the darksome road by slow degrees,Crawling or clamb'ring o'er the rugged way;The thunder rolls above, the flames around him play.Joyful at length he gain'd the steepy height,And found the rift whence sprang the friendly light.And here he stopp'd to rest his wearied feet,And weigh the perils he had still to meet;Unsheath'd his trusty sword, and dealt his eyesWith caution round him to prevent surprize;Then summon'd all the forces of his mind,And ent'ring boldly cast his fears behind,Resolv'd to push his way, whate'er withstood,Or perish bravely, as a monarch should.While he the wonders of the place survey'd,And through the various cells at random stray'd,In a dark corner of the cave he view'dSomewhat, that in the shape of woman stood;But more deform'd than dreams can representThe midnight hag, or poet's fancy paintThe Lapland witch, when she her broom bestrides,And scatters storms and tempests as she rides.She look'd as nature made her to disgraceHer kind, and cast a blot on all the race;Her shrivel'd skin, with yellow spots besmear'd,Like mouldy records seem'd; her eyes were blear'd;Her feeble limbs with age and palsy shook;Bent was her body, haggard was her look.From the dark nook outcrept the filthy crone,And propp'd upon her crutch came tott'ring on.The prince in civil guise approach'd the dame,Told her his piteous case, and whence he came,And 'till Aurora should the shades expel,Implor'd a lodging in her friendly cell.Mortal, whoe'er thou art, the fiend began,And, as she spake, a deadly horror ranThrough all his frame: his cheeks the blood forsook,Chatter'd his teeth, his knees together struck.Whoe'er thou art, that with presumption rudeDar'st on our sacred privacy intrude,And without licence in our court appear,Know, thou'rt the first that ever enter'd here.But since thou plead'st excuse, thou'rt hither broughtMore by thy fortune than thy own default,Thy crime, though great, an easy pardon finds,For mercy ever dwells in royal minds;And would you learn from whose indulgent handYou live, and in whose aweful presence stand,Know farther, through yon wide extended plainsGreat Eolus the king of tempeus reigns,And in this lofty palace makes abode,Well suited to his state, and worthy of the God.The various elements his empire own,And pay their humble homage at his throne;And hither all the storms and clouds resort,Proud to increase the splendor of his court.His queen am I, from whom the beauteous raceOf winds arose, sweet fruit of our embrace!She scarce had ended, when, with wild uproarAnd horrid din, her sons impetuous pourAround the cave; came rushing in amainLybs, Eurus, Boreas, all the boist'rous train;And close behind them on a whirlwind rodeIn clouded majesty the blust'ring God.Their locks a thousand ways were blown about;Their cheeks like full-blown bladders strutted out;Their boasting talk was of the feats th' had done,Of trees uprooted, and of towns o'erthrown;And, when they kindly turn'd them to accostThe prince, they almost pierc'd him with their frost.The gaping hag in fix'd attention stood,And at the close of every tale cried—'Good!'Blessing with outstretch'd arms each darling son,In due proportion to the mischief done.And where, said she, does little Zephyr stray?Know ye, my sons, your brother's rout to-day?In what bold deeds does he his hours employ?Grant heav'n no evil has befall'n my boy!Ne'er was he known to linger thus before.Scarce had she spoke, when at the cavern doorCame lightly tripping in a form more fairThan the young poet's fond ideas are,When fir'd with love he tries his utmost artTo paint the beauteous tyrant of his heart.A satin vest his slender shape confin'd,Embroider'd o'er with flowers of every kind,Flora's own work, when first the goddess stroveTo win the little wanderer to her love.Of burnish'd silver were his sandals made,Silver his buskins, and with gems o'erlaid;A saffron-colour'd robe behind him flow'd,And added grace and grandeur as he trod.His wings, than lilies whiter to behold,Sprinkled with azure spots, and streak'd with gold;So thin their form, and of so light a kind,That they for ever danc'd, and flutter'd in the wind.Around his temples, with becoming air,In wanton ringlets curl'd his auburn hair,And o'er his shoulders negligently spread;A wreath of fragrant roses crown'd his head.Such his attire, but O! no pen can trace,No words can shew the beauties of his face;So kind! so winning! so divinely fair!Eternal youth and pleasure flourish there;There all the little Loves and Graces meet,And every thing that's soft, and every thing that's sweet.Thou vagrant, cried the dame in angry tone,Where could'st thou loiter thus so long alone?Little thou car'st what anxious thoughts molest,What pangs are lab'ring in a mother's breast.Well do you shew your duty by your haste,For thou of all my sons art always last;A child less fondled would have fled more fast.Sure 'tis a curse on mothers, doom'd to mourn,Where best they love, the least and worst return.My dear mama, the gentle youth replied,And made a low obeisance, cease to chide,Nor wound me with your words, for well you knowYour Zephyr bears a part in all your woe;How great must be his sorrow then to learnThat he himself's the cause of your concern!Nor had I loiter'd thus had I been free,But the fair princess of FelicityIntreated me to make some short delay.And, ask'd by her, who could refuse to stay?Surrounded by the damsels of her court,She sought the shady grove, her lov'd resort;Fresh rose the grass, the flowers were mix'd between,Like rich embroid'ry on a ground of green,And in the midst, protected by the shade,A crystal stream in wild meanders play'd;While in its banks, the trembling leaves among,A thousand little birds in concert sung.Close by a mount with fragrant shrubs o'ergrown,On a cool mossy couch she laid her down;Her air, her posture, all conspir'd to please;Her head, upon her snowy arm at easeReclin'd, a studied carelessness express'd;Loose lay her robe, and naked heav'd her breast.Eager I slew to that delightful place,And pour'd a shower of kisses on her face;Now hover'd o'er her neck, her breast, her arms,Like bees o'er flowers, and tasted all her charms;And then her lips, and then her cheeks I tried,And fann'd, and wanton'd round on every side.O Zephyr, cried the fair, thou charming boy,Thy presence only can create me joy;To me thou art beyond expression dear,Nor can I quit the place while thou art here.Excuse my weakness, madam, when I swearSuch gentle words, join'd with so soft an air,Pronounc'd so sweetly from a mouth so fair,Quite ravish'd all my sense, nor did I know,How long I staid; or when, or where to go.Meanwhile the damsels, debonnair and gay,Prattled around, and laugh'd the time away:These in soft notes address'd the ravish'd ear,And warbled out so sweet, 'twas heav'n to hear;And those in rings, beneath the greenwood shade,Danc'd to the melody their fellows made.Some, studious of themselves, employ'd their careIn weaving flowery wreaths to deck their hair;While others to some fav'rite plant convey'dRefreshing showers, and cheer'd its drooping head.A joy so general spread through all the place,Such satisfaction dwelt on every face,The nymphs so kind, so lovely look'd the queen,That never eye beheld a sweeter scene.Porsenna like a statue fix'd appear'd,And, wrapp'd in silent wonder, gaz'd and heard;Much he admir'd the speech, the speaker more,And dwelt on every word, and griev'd to find it o'er.O gentle youth, he cried, proceed to tell,In what fair country does this princess dwell;What regions unexplor'd, what hidden coastCan so much goodness, so much beauty boast?To whom the winged god with gracious look,Numberless sweets diffusing while he spoke,Thus answer'd kind—These happy gardens lieFar hence remov'd, beneath a milder sky;Their name—The kingdom of Felicity.Sweet scenes of endless bliss, enchanted ground,A soil for ever sought, but seldom found;Though in the search all human kind in vainWeary their wits, and waste their lives in pain.In diff'rent parties, diff'rent paths they tread,As reason guides them, or as follies lead;These wrangling for the place they ne'er shall see,Debating those, if such a place there be;But not the wisest, nor the best, can sayWhere lies the point, or mark the certain way.Some few, by Fortune favour'd for her sport,Have sail'd in sight of this delightful port;In thought already seiz'd the bless'd abodes,And in their fond delirium rank'd with gods.Fruitless attempt! all avenues are keptBy dreadful foes, sentry that never slept.Here fell Detraction darts her pois'nous breathFraught with a thousand stings, and scatters death;Sharp-sighted Envy there maintains her post,And shakes her flaming brand, and stalks around the coast.These on the helpless bark their fury pour,Plunge in the waves, or dash against the shore;Teach wretched mortals they were doom'd to mourn,And ne'er must rest but in the silent urn.But say, young monarch, for what name you bearYour mien, your dress, your person, all declare;And though I seldom fan the frozen north,Yet I have heard of brave Porsenna's worth.My brother Boreas through the world has flown,Swelling his breath to spread forth your renown;Say, would you choose to visit this retreat,And view the world where all these wonders meet?Wish you some friend o'er that tempestuous seaTo bear you safe! behold that friend in me.My active wings shall all their force employ,And nimbly waft you to the realms of joy;As once, to gratify the god of Love,I bore fair Psyche to the Cyprian grove;Or as Jove's bird, descending from on high,Snatch'd the young Trojan trembling to the sky.There perfect bliss thou may'st for ever share,'Scap'd from the busy world, and all its care;There in the lovely princess thou shalt findA mistress ever blooming, ever kind.All ecstacy on air Porsenna trod,And to his bosom strain'd the little god;With grateful sentiments his heart o'erflow'd,And in the warmest words millions of thanks bestow'd.When Eolus in surly humour brokeTheir strict embrace, and thus abruptly spoke.Enough of compliment; I hate the sportOf meanless words; this is no human court,Where plain and honest are discarded quite,For the more modish title of polite;Where in soft speeches hypocrites impartThe venom'd ills that lurk beneath the heart;In friendship's holy guise their guilt improve,And kindly kill with specious shew of love.For us,—my subjects are not us'd to wait,And waste their hours to hear a mortal prate;They must abroad before the rising sun,And hie 'em to the seas: there's mischief to be done.Excuse my plainness, Sir, but business stands,And we have storms and shipwrecks on our hands.He ended frowning, and the noisy routEach to his several cell went puffing out.But Zephyr, far more courteous than the rest,To his own bower convey'd the royal guest;There on a bed of roses neatly laid,Beneath the fragrance of a myrtle shade,His limbs to needful rest the prince applied,His sweet companion slumb'ring by his side.BOOK II.NO sooner in her silver chariot roseThe ruddy morn, than, sated with repose,The prince address'd his host; the God awoke,And leaping from his couch, thus kindly spoke:This early call, my lord, that chides my stay,Requires my thanks, and I with joy obey.Like you I long to reach the blissful coast,Hate the slow night, and mourn the moments lost.The bright Rosinda, loveliest of the fairThat crowd the princess' court, demands my care;Ev'n now with fears and jealousies o'erbornUpbraids, and calls me cruel and forsworn.What sweet rewards on all my toils attend,Serving at once my mistress and my friend!Just to my love and to my duty too,Well paid in her, well pleas'd in pleasing you.This said, he led him to the cavern gate,And clasp'd him in his arms, and pois'd his weight;Then, balancing his body here and there,Stretch'd forth his agile wings, and launch'd in air;Swift as the fiery meteor from on highShoots to its goal, and gleams athwart the sky.Here with quick fan his lab'ring pinions play;There glide at ease along the liquid way;Now lightly skim the plain with even flight;Now proudly soar above the mountain's height.Spiteful Detraction, whose envenom'd hateSports with the suff'rings of the good and great,Spares not our prince, but with opprobrious sneerArraigns him of the heinous sin of fear;That he, so tried in arms, whose very nameInfus'd a secret panic where it came,Ev'n he, as high above the clouds he flew,And spied the mountains less'ning to the view,Nought round him but the wide expanded air,Helpless, abandon'd to a stripling's care,Struck with the rapid whirl, and dreadful height,Confess'd some faint alarm, some little fright.The friendly God, who instantly divin'dThe terrors that possess'd his fellow's mind,To calm his troubled thoughts, and cheat the way,Describ'd the nations that beneath them lay,The name, the climate, and the soil's increase,Their arms in war, their government in peace;Shew'd their domestic arts, their foreign trade,What int'rest they pursued, what leagues they made.The sweet discourse so charm'd Porsenna's ear,That lost in joy he had no time for fear.From Scandinavia's cold inclement wasteO'er wide Germania's various realms they past,And now on Albion's fields suspend their toil,And hover for a while, and bless the soil.O'er the gay scene the prince delighted hung,And gaz'd in rapture, and forgot his tongue;'Till bursting forth at length, Behold, cried he,The promis'd isle, the land I long'd to see;Those plains, those vales, and fruitful hills declareMy queen, my charmer must inhabit there.Thus rav'd the monarch, and the gentle guide,Pleas'd with his error, thus in smiles replied.I must applaud, my lord, the lucky thought;Ev'n I, who know th'original, am caught,And doubt my senses, when I view the draught.The slow-ascending hill, the lofty woodThat mantles o'er its brow, the silver floodWand'ring in mazes through the flow'ry mead,The herd that in the plenteous pastures feed,And every object, every scene excitesFresh wonder in my soul, and fills with new delights:Dwells cheerful Plenty there, and learned Ease,And Art with Nature seems at strife to please.There Liberty, delightful goddess, reigns,Gladdens each heart, and gilds the fertile plains;There firmly seated may she ever smile,And show'r her blessings o'er her fav'rite isle!But see, the rising sun reproves our stay.He said, and to the ocean wing'd his way,Stretching his course to climates then unknown,Nations that swelter in the burning zone.There in Peruvian vales a moment staid,And smooth'd his wings beneath the citron shade;Then swift his oary pinions plied again,Cross'd the new world, and sought the Southern main;Where many a wet and weary league o'erpast,The wish'd-for paradise appear'd at last.With force abated now they gently sweepO'er the smooth surface of the shining deep;The Dryads hail'd them from the distant shore,The Nereids play'd around, the Tritons swam before,While soft Favonius their arrival greets,And breathes his welcome in a thousand sweets.Nor pale disease, nor health-consuming care,Nor wrath, nor foul revenge, can enter there;No vapour'd foggy gloom imbrowns the sky;No tempests rage, no angry lightnings fly;But dews, and soft refreshing airs are found,And pure aetherial azure shines around.Whate'er the sweet Sabaean soil can boast,Or Mecca's plains, or India's spicy coast;What Hybla's hills, or rich Oebalia's fields,Or flow'ry vale of fam'd Hymettus yields;Or what of old th' Hesperian orchard grac'd;All that was e'er delicious to the taste,Sweet to the smell, or lovely to the view,Collected there with added beauty grew.High-tow'ring to the Heavens the trees are seen.Their bulk immense, their leaf for ever green;So closely interwove, the tell-tale sunCan ne'er descry the deeds beneath them done,But where by sits the sportive gales divideTheir tender tops, and fan the leaves aside.Like a smooth carpet at their feet lies spreadThe matted grass, by bubbling fountains fed;And on each bough the feather'd choir employTheir melting notes, and nought is heard but joy.The painted flowers exhale a rich perfume,The fruits are mingled with eternal bloom,And Spring and Autumn hand in hand appear,Lead on the merry months, and join to cloath the year.Here, o'er the mountain's shaggy summit pour'd,From rock to rock the tumbling torrent roar'd,While beauteons Iris in the vale belowPaints on the rising fumes her radiant bow.Now through the meads the mazy current stray'd,Now hid its wand'rings in the myrtle shade;Or in a thousand veins divides its store,Visits each plant, refreshes every flower;O'er gems and golden sands ha murmurs flows,And sweetly soothes the soul, and lulls to soft repose.If hunger call, no sooner can the mindExpress her will to needful food inclin'd,But in some cool recess, or op'ning glade,The seats are plac'd; the tables neatly laid,And instantly convey'd by magic handIn comely rows the costly dishes stand;Meats of all kinds that nature can impart,Prepar'd in all the nicest forms of art.A troop of sprightly nymphs array'd in green,With flow'ry chaplets crown'd, come scudding in;With fragrant blossoms these adorn the feast,Those with officious zeal attend the guest;Beneath his feet the silken carpet spread,Or sprinkle liquid odours o'er his head.Others in ruby cups with roses bound,Delightful! deal the sparkling nectar round;Or weave the dance, or tune the vocal lay;The lyres resound, the merry minstrels play;Gay health, and youthful joys o'erspread the place,And swell each heart, and triumph in each face.So, when embolden'd by the vernal air,The busy bees to blooming fields repair;For various use employ their chymic pow'r;One culls the snowy pounce, one sucks the flow'r;Again to diff'rent works returning home,Some Or stive, stipant. steeve the honey, some erect the comb;All for the general good in concert strive,And ever soul's in motion, every limb's alive.And now descending from his flight, the GodOn the green turf releas'd his precious load;There, after mutual salutations past,And endless friendship vow'd, they part in haste;Zephyr impatient to behold his love,The prince in raptures wand'ring through the grove,Now skipping on, and singing as he went,Now stopping short to give his transports vent;With sudden gusts of happiness oppress'd,Or stands entranc'd, or raves like one possess'd;His mind afloat, his wand'ring senses quiteO'ercome with charms, and frantic with delight;From scene to scene by random steps convey'd,Admires the distant views, explores the secret shade,Dwells on each spot, with eager eye devoursThe woods, the lawns, the buildings, and the bowers;New sweets, new joys at every glance arise,And every turn creates a fresh surprize.Close by the borders of a rising wood,In a green vale a crystal grotto stood;And o'er its side, beneath a beechen shade,In broken falls a silver fountain play'd.Hither, attracted by the murm'ring stream,And cool recess, the pleas'd Porsenna came,And on the tender grass reclining choseTo wave his joys awhile, and take a short repose.The scene invites him, and the wanton breezeThat whispers through the vale, the dancing trees,The warbling birds, and rills that gently creep,All join their music to prolong his sleep.The princess for her morning walk prepar'd;The female troops attend, a beauteous guard.Array'd in all her charms appear'd the fair;Tall was her stature, unconfin'd her air;Proportion deck'd her limbs, and in her faceLay love inshrin'd, lay sweet attractive graceTemp'ring the aweful beams her eyes convey'd,And like a lambent flame around her play'd.No foreign aids, by mortal ladies worn,From shells and rocks her artless charms adorn;For grant that beauty were by gems increas'd,'Tis render'd more suspected at the least;And foul defects, that would escape the sight,Start from the piece, and take a stronger light.Her chesnut hair in careless rings aroundHer temples wav'd, with pinks and jes'mine crown'd,And, gather'd in a silken cord behind,Curl'd to the waist, and floated in the wind;O'er these a veil of yellow gauze she wore,With amaranths and gold embroider'd o'er.Her snowy neck half naked to the viewGracefully fell; a robe of purple hueHung loosely o'er her slender shape, and triedTo shade those beauties, that it could not hide.The damsels of her train with mirth and songFrolic behind, and laugh and sport along.The birds proclaim their queen from every tree;The beasts run frisking through the groves to see;The Loves, the Pleasures, and the Graces meetIn antic rounds, and dance before her feet.By whate'er fancy led, it chanc'd that dayThey through the secret valley took their way,And to the crystal grot advancing spiedThe prince extended by the fountain's side.He look'd as, by some skilful hand express'd,Apollo's youthful form retir'd to rest;When with the chace fatigued he quits the woodFor Pindus' vale, and Aganippe's flood;There sleeps secure, his careless limbs display'dAt ease, encircled by the laurel shade;Beneath his head his sheaf of arrows lie,His bow unbent hangs negligently by.The slumb'ring prince might boast an equal grace,So turn'd his limbs, so beautiful his face.Waking he started from the ground in haste,And saw the beauteous choir around him plac'd;Then, summoning his senses, ran to meetThe queen, and laid him humbly at her feet:Deign, lovely princess, to behold, said he,One, who has travers'd all the world to seeThose charms, and worship thy divinity:Accept thy slave, and with a gracious smileExcuse his rashness, and reward his toil.Stood motionless the fair with mute surprize,And read him over with admiring eyes;And while she stedfast gaz'd, a pleasing smartRan thrilling through her veins, and reach'd her heart.Each limb she scann'd, consider'd every grace,And sagely judg'd him of the phoenix race.An animal like this she ne'er had known,And thence concluded there could be but one;The creature too had all the phoenix air;None but the phoenix could appear so fair.The more she look'd, the more she thought it true,And call'd him by that name, to shew she knew.O handsome phoenix, for that such you areWe know: your beauty does your breed declare;And I with sorrow own through all my coastNo other bird can such perfection boast;For Nature form'd you single and alone:Alas! what pity 'tis there is but one!Were there a queen so fortunate to shewAn aviary of charming birds like you,What envy would her happiness createIn all, who saw the glories of her state!The prince laugh'd inwardly, surpriz'd to findSo strange a speech, so innocent a mind.The compliment indeed did some offenceTo reason, and a little wrong'd her sense;He could not let it pass, but told his name,And what he was, and whence, and why he came;And hinted other things of high concernFor him to mention, and for her to learn;And she 'ad a piercing wit, of wond'rous reachTo comprehend whatever he could teach.Thus hand in hand they to the palace walk,Pleas'd and instructed with each other's talk.Here should I tell the furniture's expence,And all the structure's vast magnificence,Describe the walls of shining sapphire made,With emerald and pearl the floors inlaid,And how the vaulted canopies unfoldA mimic heav'n, and flame with gems and gold;Or how Felicity regales her guest,The wit, the mirth, the music, and the feast;And on each part bestow the praises due,'Twould tire the writer, and the render too.My amorous tale a softer path pursues:Love and the happy pair demand my Muse.O could her art in equal terms expressThe lives they lead, the pleasures they possess!Fortune had ne'er so plenteously beforeBestow'd her gifts, nor can she lavish more.'Tis heaven itself, 'tis ecstacy of bliss,Uninterrupted joy, untir'd excess;Mirth following mirth the moments dance away;Love claims the night, and friendship rules the day.Their tender care no cold indiff'rence knows;No jealousies disturb their sweet repose;No sickness, no decay; but youthful grace,And constant beauty shines in either face.Benumming age may mortal charms invade,Flowers of a day that do but bloom and fade;Far diff'rent here, on them it only blowsThe lily's white, and spreads the blushing rose;No conquest o'er those radiant eyes can boast;They like the stars shine brighter in its frost;Nor fear its rigour, nor its rule obey;All seasons are the same, and every month is May.Alas! how vain is happiness below!Man soon or late must have his share of woe:Slight are his joys, and fleeting as the wind;His griefs wound home, and leave a sting behind.His lot distinguish'd from the brute appearsLess certain by his laughter than his tears;For ignorance too oft our pleasure breeds,But sorrow from the reas'ning soul proceeds.If man on earth in endless bliss could be,The boon, young prince, had been bestow'd on thee.Bright shone thy stars, thy Fortune flourish'd fair,And seem'd secure beyond the reach of care,And so might still have been, but anxious thoughtHas dash'd thy cup, and thou must taste the draught.It so befel: as on a certain dayThis happy couple toy'd their time away,He ask'd how many charming hours were flown,Since on her slave her heav'n of beauty shone.Should I consult my heart, cried he, the rateWere small, a week would be the utmost date:But when my mind reflects on actions past,And counts its joys, time must have fled more fast.Perhaps I might have said, three months are gone,Three months! replied the fair, three months alone!Know that three hundred years have roll'd away,Since at my feet the lovely phoenix lay.Three hundred years! re-echoed back the prince,A whole three hundred years compleated sinceI landed here! O! whither then are flownMy dearest friends, my subjects, and my throne?How strange, alas! how alter'd shall I findEach earthly thing, each scene I left behind!Who knows me now! on whom shall I dependTo gain my rights! where shall I find a friend!My crown perhaps may grace a foreign line,A race of kings, that know not me nor mine;Who reigns may wish my death; his subjects treatMy claim with scorn, and call their prince a cheat.Oh had my life been ended as begun!My destin'd stage, my race of glory run,I should have died well pleas'd; my honour'd nameHad liv'd, had flourish'd in the list of fame;Reflecting now my mind with horror seesThe sad survey, a scene of shameful ease,The odious blot, the scandal of my race,Scarce known, and only mention'd with disgrace.The fair beheld him with impatient eye,And red with anger made this warm reply:Ungrateful man! is this the kind returnMy love deserves? and can you thus with scornReject what once you priz'd, what once you sworeSurpass'd all charms, and made ev'n glory poor?What gifts have I bestow'd, what favours shewn!Made you partaker of my bed and throne;Three centuries preserv'd in youthful prime,Safe from the rage of death, and injuries of time.Weak arguments! for glory reigns aboveThe feeble ties of gratitude and love.I urge them not, nor would request your stay;The phantom glory calls, and I obey;All other virtues are regardless quite,Sunk and absorb'd in that superior light.Go then, barbarian, to thy realms return,And shew thyself unworthy my concern;Go, tell the world, your tender heart could giveDeath to the princess, by whose care you live.At this a deadly pale her cheeks o'erspread,Cold trembling seiz'd her limbs, her spirits fled;She sunk into his arms: the prince was mov'd,Felt all her griefs, for still he greatly lov'd.He sigh'd, he wish'd he could forget his throne,Confine his thoughts, and live for her alone;But glory shot him deep, the venom'd dartWas fix'd within, and rankled at his heart;He could not hide its wounds, but pin'd awayLike a sick flower, and languish'd in decay.An age no longer like a month appears,But every month becomes a hundred years.Felicity was griev'd, and could not bearA scene so chang'd, a sight of so much care.She told him with a look of cold disdain,And seeming ease, as women well can feign,He might depart at will; a milder airWould mend his health; he was no pris'ner there;She kept him not, and wish'd he ne'er might findCause to regret the place he left behind,Which once he lov'd, and where he still must ownHe had at least some little pleasure known.If these prophetic words awhile destroyHis peace, the former balance it in joy.He thank'd her for her kind concern, but choseTo quit the place, the rest let heav'n dispose.For Fate, on mischiefs bent, perverts the will,And first infatuates whom it means to kill.Aurora now, not, as she wont to rise,In gay attire ting'd with a thousand dyes,But sober-sad in solemn state appears,Clad in a dusky veil bedew'd with tears.Thick mantling clouds beneath her chariot spread,A faded wreath hangs drooping from her head.The sick'ning sun emits a feeble ray,Half drown'd in fogs, and struggling into day.Some black event the threat'ning skies foretel.Porsenna rose to take his last farewel.A curious vest the mournful princess brought,And armour by the Lemnian artist wrought,A shining lance with secret virtue stor'd,And of resistless force a magic sword,Caparisons and gems of wond'rous price,And loaded him with gifts and good advice;But chief she gave, and what he most would need,The fleetest of her stud, a flying steed.The swift Grisippo, said th' afflicted fair,(Such was the courser's name) with speed shall bear,And place you safely in your native air;Assist against the foe, with matchless mightRavage the field, and turn the doubtful fight;With care protect you till the danger cease,Your trust in war, your ornament in peace.But this, I warn, beware; whate'er shall layTo intercept your course, or tempt your stay,Quit not your saddle, nor your speed abate,'Till safely landed at your palace gate.On this alone depends your weal or woe;Such is the will of Fate, and so the Gods foreshew.He in the softest terms repaid her love,And vow'd, nor age, nor absence, should removeHis constant faith, and sure she could not blameA short divorce due to his injur'd fame.The debt discharg'd, then should her soldier comeGay from the field, and, flush'd with conquest, home;With equal ardour her affection meet,And lay his laurels at his mistress' feet.He ceas'd, and sighing took a kind adieu;Then urg'd his steed; the fierce Grisippo flew;With rapid force outstripp'd the lagging wind,And left the blissful shores, and weeping fair behind;Now o'er the seas pursu'd his airy flight,Now scower'd the plains, and climb'd the mountain's height.Thus driving on at speed the prince had runNear half his course, when, with the setting sun,As through a lonely lane he chanc'd to ride,With rocks and bushes fenc'd on either side,He spied a waggon full of wings, that layBroke and o'erturn'd across the narrow way.The helpless driver on the dirty roadLay struggling, crush'd beneath th' incumbent load.Never in human shape was seen beforeA wight so pale, so feeble, and so poor.Comparisons of age would do him wrong,For Nestor's self, if plac'd by him, were young.His limbs were naked all, and worn so thin,The bones seem'd starting through the parchment skin,His eyes half drown'd in rheum, his accents weak,Bald was his head, and furrow'd was his cheek.The conscious steed stopp'd short in deadly fright.And back recoiling stretch'd his wings for flight,When thus the wretch with supplicating tone,And rueful face, began his piteous moan,And, as he spake, the tears ran trickling down.O gentle youth, if pity e'er inclin'dThy soul to gen'rous deeds, if e'er thy mindWas touch'd with soft distress, extend thy careTo save an old man's life, and ease the load I bear.So may propitious heaven your journey speed,Prolong your days, and all your vows succeed.Mov'd with the prayer the kind Porsenna staid,Too nobly-minded to refuse his aid,And, prudence yielding to superior grief,Leap'd from his steed, and ran to his relief;Remov'd the weight, and gave the pris'ner breath,Just choak'd, and gasping on the verge of death;Then reach'd his hand, when lightly with a boundThe grizly spectre, vaulting from the ground,Seiz'd him with sudden gripe, th' astonish'd princeStood horror-struck, and thoughtless of defence.O king of Russia, with a thund'ring soundBellow'd the ghastly fiend, at length thou'rt found.Receive the ruler of mankind, and know,My name is Time, thy ever-dreaded foe.These feet are founder'd, and the wings you seeWorn to the pinions in pursuit of thee;Through all the world in vain for ages sought,But Fate has doom'd thee now, and thou art caught.Then round his neck his arms he nimbly cast,And seiz'd him by the throat, and grasp'd him fast;Till forc'd at length the soul forsook its seat,And the pale breathless corse fell bleeding at his feet.Scarce had the cursed spoiler left his prey,When, so it chanc'd, young Zephyr pass'd that way;Too late his presence to assist his friend,A sad, but helpless witness of his end.He chafes, and fans, and strives in vain to cureHis streaming wounds; the work was done too sure.Now lightly with a soft embrace uprearsThe lifeless load, and bathes it in his tears;Then to the blissful seats with speed conveys,And graceful on the mossy carpet laysWith decent care, close by the fountain's side,Where first the princess had her phoenix spied.There with sweet flowers his lovely limbs he strew'd,And gave a parting kiss, and sighs and tears bestow'd.To that sad solitude the weeping dame,Wild with her loss, and swoln with sorrow, came.There was she wont to vent her griefs, and mournThose dear delights that must no more return.Thither that morn with more than usual careShe sped, but oh what joy to find him there!As just arriv'd, and weary with the way,Retir'd to soft repose her hero lay.Now near approaching she began to creepWith careful steps, loth to disturb his sleep;'Till quite o'ercome with tenderness she flew,And round his neck her arms in transport threw.But, when she found him dead, no tongue can tellThe pangs she felt; she shriek'd, and swooning fell.Waking, with loud laments she pierc'd the skies,And fill'd th' affrighted forest with her cries.That fatal hour the palace gate she barr'd,And fix'd around the coast a stronger guard;Now rare appearing, and at distance seen,With crowds of black misfortunes plac'd between;Mischiefs of every kind, corroding care,And fears, and jealousies, and dark despair.And since that day (the wretched world must ownThese mournful truths by sad experience known)No mortal e'er enjoy'd that happy clime,And every thing on earth submits to Time.THE EVER-GREEN.BY WILLIAM SHENSTONE, Esq.WHEN tepid breezes fann'd the air,And violets perfum'd the glade,Pensive and grave my charming fairBeneath yon shady lime was laid.Flourish, said I, those favour'd boughs,And ever sooth the purest flames;Witness to none but faithful vows!Wounded by none but faithful names!Yield every tree that crowns the groveTo this which pleas'd my wandering dear!Range where you will, ye bands of love,Ye still shall seem to revel here.Lavinia smil'd—and whilst her armHer fair reclining head sustain'd,Betray'd she felt some fresh alarm;And thus the meaning smile explain'd.When summer suns shine forth no more,Will then this lime its shelter yield?Protect us when the tempests roar,And winter drives us from the field?Yet faithful then the fir shall last—I smile, she cry'd, but ah! I tremble,To think, when my fair season's past,Which Damon then will most resemble.ANSWER.BY THE SAME.TOO tim'rous maid, can time or chanceA pure ingenuous flame controul?O lay aside that tender glance,That melts my frame, that kills my soul.Were but thy outward charms admir'd,Frail origin of female sway!My flame, like other flames inspir'd,Might then like other flames decay:But whilst thy mind shall seem thus fair,Thy soul's unfading charms be seen,Thou may'st resign that shape and air,Yet find thy swain—an ever-green.CANDOUR.BY THE SAME.THE warmest friend, I ever prov'd,My bitterest foe I see:The kindest maid I ever lov'd,Is false to love and me.But shall I make the angry vow,Which tempts my wavering mind?Shall dark suspicion cloud my brow,And bid me shun mankind?Avaunt, thou hell-born fiend! no morePretend my steps to guide;Let me be cheated o'er and o'er,But let me still confide.If this be folly, all my claimTo wisdom I resign;But let no sage presume to nameHis happiness with mine.LYSANDER TO CLOE.BY THE SAME.'TIS true, my wish will never findAnother nymph so fair, so true;Since all that's bright, and all that's kind,In those expressive eyes I view.And I with grateful zeal could hasteTo China for the merest toy,Could scorch on Libya's barren waste,To give my dear a moment's joy.But, fickle as the wave or wind,I once may slight those lovely arms;Pardon a free ingenuous mind,I do not half deserve thy charms.If I in any praise excel,'Tis in soft themes to paint my flame;But Chloe's sweetness bids me tell,I shall not long remain the same.I know its season will expire,Replac'd by cool esteem alone;Nor more thy matchless breast admire,Than I detest and scorn my own.This interval my fate allows,And friendship dictates all I say;O shun to hear my future vows,When giddy love resumes the lay.So some poor maniac can foreseeThe random hours of madness nigh;He mourns the fates' severe decree,And cautions whom he loves to fly.CLOE TO LYSANDER.BY THE SAME.OF vagrant loves, and fickle flamesLysander's Muse may tell,And sure such artless freedom claimsHis Cloe's best farewel.Whene'er his heart becomes the themeWe see his fancy shine;But let not vain Lysander dreamThat e'er that heart was mine.Can he that fondly hopes to move,With caution chill his lay?Can he who feels the power of love,Foretel that love's decay?Why teize believing nymphs in vain?Go seek some pathless vale,And listen to thy vocal strainSoft echoing down the dale.While artless Cloe, hence retir'd,Shall this sad maxim prove;No bosom, once with love inspir'd,Could ever cease to love.TO THE MEMORY OF AN AGREEABLE LADY BURYEB IN MARRIAGE TO A PERSON UNDESERVING HER.'TWAS always held, and ever will,By sage mankind, discreeterT' anticipate a lesser illThan undergo a greater.When mortals dread diseases, pain,And languishing conditions;Who don't the lesser ills sustainOf physic and physicians?Rather than lose his whole estate,He that but little wise is,Full gladly pays four parts in eightTo taxes and excises.With numerous ills in single lifeThe batchelor's attended;Such to avoid, he takes a wife—And much the case is mended.Poor Gratia, in her twentieth year,Foreseeing future woe,Chose to attend a monkey here,Before an ape below.AN ELEGY, WRITTEN ON VALENTINE MORNING.BY * * * *HARK, through the sacred silence of the night,Loud Chanticleer doth sound his clarion shrill,Hailing with song the first pale gleam of light,That floats the dark brow of yon eastern hill.Bright star of morn, oh! leave not yet the wave,To deck the dewy frontlet of the day,Nor thou, Aurora, quit Tithonus' cave,Nor drive retiring darkness yet away,Ere these my rustic hands a garland twine,Ere yet my tongue indite a simple song,For her I mean to hail my Valentine,Sweet maiden, fairest of the virgin throng.Sweet is the morn, and sweet the gentle breezeThat fans the fragrant bosom of the spring,Sweet chirps the lark, and sweeter far than theseThe gentle love-song gurgling turtles sing.Oh let the flowers be fragrant as the morn,And as the turtle's song my ditty sweet:Those flowers my woven chaplet must adorn,That ditty must my waking charmer greet.And thou, blest saint, whom choral creatures joinIn one enlivening symphony to hail,Oh be propitious, gentle Valentine,And let each holy tender sigh prevail.Oh give me to approach my sleeping love,And strew her pillow with the freshest flowers,No figh unhallow'd shall my bosom move,Nor step prophane pollute my true-love's bowers.At sacred distance only will I gaze,Nor bid my unreproved eye refrain,Mean while my tongue shall chaunt her beauty's praise,And hail her sleeping with the gentlest strain."Awake my fair, awake, for it is time;Hark, thousand songsters rise from yonder grove,And rising carol this sweet hour of prime,Each to his mate, a roundelay of love.All nature sings the hymeneal song,All nature follows, where the spring invites;Come forth, my love, to us these joys belong,Ours is the spring, and all her young delights.For us she throws profusely forth her flowers,Which in fresh chaplets joyful I will twine;Come forth, my fair, oh do not lose these hours,But wake, and be my faithful Valentine.Full many an hour, all lonely have I sigh'd,Nor dared the secret of my love reveal,Full many a fond expedient have I triedMy warmest wish in silence to conceal.And oft to far retired solitudeAll mournfully my slow step have I bent,Luxurious there indulg'd my musing mood,And there alone have given my sorrows vent.This day resolv'd I dare to plight my vow,This day, long since the feast of love decreed,Embolden'd will I speak my flame, nor thouRefuse to hear how sore my heart does bleed.Yet if I should behold my love awake,Ah, frail resolves, ah whither will ye fly?Full well I know I shall not silence break,But struck with awe almost for fear shall die.Oh no, I will not trust a fault'ring speechIn broken phrase an aukward tale to tellA tale, whose tenderness no tongue can reach,Nor softest melody can utter well.But my meek eye, best herald to my heart,I will compose to soft and downcast look,And at one humble glance it shall impartMy love, nor fear the language be mistook.For she shall read (apt scholar at this lore)With what fond passion my true bosom glows,How hopeless of return I still adore,Nor dare the boldness of my wish disclose.Should she then smile,—yet ah! she smiles on all,Her gentle temper pities all distress;On every hill, each vale, the sun-beams fall,Each herb, and flower, each tree, and shrub they bless.Alike all nature grateful owns the boon,The universal ray to all is free;Like fond Endymion should I hope the moon,Because among the rest she shines on me?Hope, vain presumer, keep, oh keep away:Ev'n if my woe her gentle bosom move,Pity some look of kindness may display;But each soft glance is not a look of love.Yet, heav'nly visitant, thou dost not quitThose bow'rs where angels sweet division sing,Nor deignest thou on mortal shrine to sitAlone, for round thee ever on the wing,Glad choirs of love, attend, and hov'ring waitThy mild command; of these thy blooming trainOh bid some sylph in morning dreams relate,Ere yet my love awake, my secret pain.THE DOWAGER.BY THE SAME.WHERE aged elms, in many a goodly row,Give yearly shelter to the constant crow,A mansion stands:—long since the pile was rais'd,Whose Gothic grandeur the rude hind amaz'd.For the rich ornament on every partConfess'd the founder's wealth, and workman's art:Though as the range of the wide court we tread,The broken arch now totters o'er the head;And where of old rose high the social smoke,Now swallows build, and lonely ravens croak.Though Time, whose touch each beauty can deface,Has torn from every tow'r the sculptur'd grace;Though round each stone the sluggard ivy crawls;Yet ancient state sits hov'ring on the walls.Where wont the festal chorus to resound,And jocund dancing frequent beat the ground,Now silence spreads around her gloomy reign,Save when the mastiff clanks his iron chain,Save when his hoarse bark echoes dire alarm,Fierce to protect the place from midnight harm,Its only guard; no revel sounding lateDrives the night villain from the lonely gate.An hallow'd matron and her simple trainThese solemn battlements alone contain;An hoary dowager, whose placid faceOld age has deck'd with lovely aweful grace;With almost vernal bloom her cheek still strow'd,As beauty ling'ring left her lov'd abode;That lov'd abode, where join'd with truth and senseShe form'd the features to mute eloquence,And bade them charm the still attentive throng,Who watch'd the sacred lessons of her tongue.For not through life the dame had liv'd retir'd,But once had shone, e'en midst a court admir'd:What time the lov'd possessor of her charmsReturning from the war in victor arms,Call'd from his monarch's tongue the plausive praise,While honour wreath'd him with unfading bays.She, happy partner of each joyful hour,Then walk'd serene amid the pomp of pow'r:While all confess'd no warrior's wish could moveFor fairer prize than such accomplished love:Nor to that love could aught more transport yield,Than graceful valour from the victor field.Thus flourish'd once the beauteous and the brave;But mortal bliss meets the untimely grave:Aurelius died—his relict's pious tearO'er his lov'd ashes frequent flow'd sincere,Each decent rite with due observance paid,Each solemn requiem offered to his shade,Plac'd 'mid the brave his urn in holy ground,And bade his hallow'd banners wave around.Then left the gaudy scenes of pomp and power,While prudence beckon'd to that ancient bower,And those paternal fields, the sole remainsOf ample woods and far-extended plains,Which tyrant custom rudely tore away,To distant heirship an expected prey.Serene she sought the far retired grove,Once the bless'd mansion of her happy love,Pleas'd with the thought, that memory oft would raiseA solemn prospect of those blooming daysAurelius gave; her pious purpose nowTo keep still constant to her sacred vow,In lonely luxury her sorrows feed,And pass her life in widow's decent weed.One pledge of love her comfort still remain'd,Whom in this solitude she careful train'dTo virtuous lore; and while as year by yearNew graces made Aurelia still more dear;Full many an hour unheeded she would traceThe father's semblance in the daughter's face;While tender sighs oft heav'd her faithful breast,And sudden tears her lasting love exprest.Thus long she dwelt in innate virtues great,Amid the villages in sacred state:For every grace to which submission bows,The pow'r which conscious dignity bestows,She felt superior; for from ancient raceShe gloried her long ancestry to trace;And ever bade Aurelia's thought aspireTo every grace, each ray of sacred fire,That full of heav'n-born dignity informsThe mortal breast which ardent virtue warms;Then led her to the venerable hallWhere her successive fires adorn'd the wall,And arched windows with their blazon brightShed through the herald glow a solemn light;There clad in rough habiliments of warFull many a hero bore a glorious scar;There in the civic fur the sons of peace,Whose counsels bade their country's tumults cease;While by their side, gracing the ancient scene,Hung gentle ladies of most comely mien.Then eager through the well-known tale she run,In what fair cause each honour had been won,What female grace each virgin had possess'dTo charm to gentle love the manly breast;Pleas'd to observe how long her gen'rous bloodThrough fair and brave had pass'd a spotless flood.Mean while the young Aurelia's bosom fir'dWith emulation by each tale inspir'd,In eager transport frequent breath'd her prayerThe graces of her ancestry to share:Nor breath'd in vain, her fond maternal guideCherish'd with care each spark of virtuous pride;And ever as she gave a lesson new,Would point some old example to her view:Inflam'd by this, her mind was quickly fraughtWith each sage precept, that her mother taught.The goodly dame, thus bless'd in her employ,Felt each soft transport of parental joy,And liv'd content, her utmost wish fulfill'dIn the fair prospect of a virtuous child:Resign'd she waited now the aweful hourWhen death should raise her to that heav'nly bow'r,Where with her lov'd Aurelius she might shareThe pleasing task, to watch with guardian careTheir offspring's steps, and hov'ring o'er her head,The gracious dew of heavenly peace to shed;Nor fear'd her decency of life would proveAn added bliss to all the joys above.ODE TO THE HONOURABLE * * * *.BY MR.

He was uniformly attached to the measures of Sir Robert Walpole, afterwards Lord Orford, and generally in possession of some lucrative post under government. On reviving the order of the Bath in 1725, he had the honour to be named one of the Knights Companions. His death happened on August 10, 1755..I.DEAR Colin, prevent my warm blushes,Since how can I speak without pain?My eyes have oft told you their wishes,Ah! can't you their meaning explain?My passion would lose by expression,And you too might cruelly blame:Then don't you expect a confessionOf what is too tender to name.II.Since yours is the province of speaking,Why should you expect it of me?Our wishes should be in our keeping,'Till you tell us what they should be.Then quickly why don't you discover?Did your breast feel tortures like mine,Eyes need not tell over and overWhat I in my bosom confine.SIR WILLIAM YONGE'S ANSWER.I.GOOD madam, when ladies are willing,A man must needs look like a fool;For me, I would not give a shillingFor one that is kind out of rule.At least you might stay for my offer,Not snatch like old maids in despair,If you've liv'd to these years without proffer,Your sighs are now lost in the air.II.You might leave me to guess by your blushing,And not speak the matter so plain;'Tis ours to pursue and be pushing,'Tis yours to affect a disdain.That you're in a pitiful taking,By all your sweet ogles I see;But the fruit that will fall without shakingIndeed is too mellow for me.MISS SOPER's Answer to a LADY, who invited her to retire into a monastic Life at ST.

PERCYThomas Percy, D. D. now Dean of Carlisle..O Nancy, wilt thou go with me,Nor sigh to leave the flaunting town:Can silent glens have charms for thee,The lowly cot and russet gown?No longer dress'd in silken sheen,No longer deck'd with jewels rare,Say, canst thou quit each courtly scene,Where thou wert fairest of the fair?O Nancy! when thou'rt far away,Wilt thou not cast a wish behind?Say, canst thou face the parching ray,Nor shrink before the wintry wind?O can that soft and gentle mienExtremes of hardship learn to bear,Nor sad regret each courtly scene,Where thou wert fairest of the fair?O Nancy! canst thou love so true,Through perils keen with me to go,Or when thy swain mishap shall rue,To share with him the pang of woe?Say, should disease or pain befal,Wilt thou assume the nurse's care,Nor wistful those gay scenes recallWhere thou wert fairest of the fair?And when at last thy love shall die,Wilt thou receive his parting breath?Wilt thou repress each struggling sigh,And chear with smiles the bed of death?And wilt thou o'er his breathless clayStrew flow'rs, and drop the tender tear,Nor then regret those scenes so gay,Where thou wert fairest of the fair?CYNTHIA, AN ELEGIAC POEM.BY THE SAME.— Libeat tibi Cynthia mecumRoscida muscofis antra tenere jugis.PROPERT.BENEATH an aged oak's embow'ring shade,Whose spreading arms with gray moss fringed were,Around whose trunk the clasping ivy stray'd;A love-lorn youth oft pensive would repair.Fast by, a Naïd taught her stream to glide,Which through the dale a winding channel wore:The silver willow deck'd its verdant side,The whisp'ring sedges wav'd along the shore.Here oft, when Morn peep'd o'er the dusky hill;Here oft when Eve bedew'd the misty vale;Careless he laid him all beside the rill,And pour'd in strains like these his artless tale.Ah! would he say—and then a sigh would heave:Ah, Cynthia! sweeter than the breath of morn,Soft as the gentle breath that fans at eve,Of thee bereft, how shall I live forlorn?Ah! what avails this sweetly solemn bow'r,That silent stream where dimpling eddies play;Yon thymy bank bedeck'd with many a flow'r,Where maple-tufts exclude the beam of day?Robb'd of my love, for how can these delight,Though lavish Spring her smiles around has cast!Despair, alas! that whelms the soul in night,Dims the sad eye and deadens every taste.As droops the lily at the blighting gale;Or — On her left breastA mole cinque-spotted: like the crimson dropsI' th' bottom of a cowslip.Shakspeare's Cymbeline, Act 3. crimson-spotted cowslip of the mead,Whose tender stalk (alas! their stalk so frail)Some hasty foot hath bruis'd with heedless tread:As droops the woodbine, when some village hindHath fell'd the sapling elm it fondly bound;No more it gadding dances in the wind,But trails its fading beauties on the ground:So droops my soul, dear maid, downcast, and sad,For ever! ah! for ever torn from thee;Bereft of each sweet hope, which once it had,When love, when treacherous love first smil'd on me.Return, blest days, return, ye laughing hours,Which led me up the roseat steep of youth;Which strew'd my simple path with vernal flow'rs,And bade me court chaste Science and fair Truth.Ye know, the curling breeze, or gilded flyThat idly wantons in the noon-tide air,Was not so free, was not so gay as I,For ah! I knew not then or love, or care.Witness, ye winged daughters of the year,If e'er a sigh had learnt to heave my breast!If e'er my cheek was conscious of a tear,'Till Cynthia came and robb'd my soul of rest!O have you seen, bath'd in the morning dew,The budding rose its infant bloom display;When first its virgin tints unfold to view,It shrinks and scarcely trusts the blaze of day?So soft, so delicate, so sweet she came,Youth's-damask glow just dawning on her cheek:I gaz'd, I sigh'd, I caught the tender flame,Felt the fond pang, and droop'd with passion, weak.Yet not unpitied was my pain the while;For oft beside yon sweet-briar in the dale,With many a blush, with many a melting smile,She sate and listen'd to the plaintive tale.Ah me! I fondly dreamt of pleasures rare,Nor deem'd so sweet a face with scorn could glow;How could you cruel then pronounce despair,Chill the warm hope, and plant the thorn of woe?What though no treasure canker in my chest,Nor crowds of suppliant vassals hail me lord!What though my roof can boast no princely guest,Nor surfeits lurk beneath my frugal board!Yet should Content, that shuns the gilded bed,With smiling Peace, and Virtue there forgot,And rose-lip'd Health, which haunts the straw-built shed,With cherub Joy, frequent my little cot:Led by chaste Love, the decent band should come,O charmer would'st thou deign my roof to share!Nor should the Muses scorn our simple dome,Or knit in mystic dance the Graces fair.The wood-land nymphs, and gentle fays, at eveForth from the dripping cave and mossy dell,Should round our hearth fantastic measures weave,And shield from mischief by their guardian spell.Come then, bright maid, and quit the city throng;Have rural joys no charm to win the soul?— She proud, alas! derides my lowly song,Scorns the fond vow, and spurns the ruset stole.Then, Love, begone, thy thriftless empire yield,In youthful toils I'll lose th' unmanly pain:With echoing horns I'll rouse the jocund field,Urge the keen chace, and sweep along the plain.Or all in some lone moss-grown tow'r sublimeWith midnight lamp I'll watch pale Cynthia round,Explore the choicest rolls of ancient Time,And heal with Wisdom's balm my hapless wound.Or else I'll roam—Ah no! that sigh profoundTells me that stubborn love disdains to yield;Nor flight, nor Wisdom's balm can heal the wound,Nor pain forsake me in the jocund field.DIALOGUE TO CHLORINDA.BY MR. ALSOPAnthony Alsop, the author of this dialogue and of the three subsequent poems, was educated in Westminster college, and from thence elected to Christ Church in Oxford, where he took the degrees of M. A. March 23, 1696, and of B. D. Dec. 12, 1706. On his coming to the university he was very soon distinguished by Dean Aldrich. He passed through the usual offices in his college to that of Censor with considerable reputation, and for some years had the principal noblemen and gentlemen belonging to the society committed to his care. In this useful employment he continued until his merits recommended him to Sir Jonathan Trelawny, Bishop of Winchester, who appointed him his chaplain, and soon after gave him a prebend in his own Cathedral, together with the rectory of Brightwell, in the county of Berks, which afforded him ample provision for a learned retirement, in which he remained to the end of his days; and so well satisfied was he with a recluse life, that he could not be drawn from it by the repeated solicitations of those who thought him qualified for a more public character and a higher station. His death, which happened June 10, 1726, was occasioned by his falling into a ditch that led to his garden door, the path being narrow, and part of it giving way under his feet..S.CEASE, Chlorinda, cease to chide me,When my passion I relate;Why should kindness be denied me?Why should love be paid with hate?If the fruit of all my wishesMust be, to be treated so;What could you do more than this isTo your most outrageous foe?C.Simple Strephon, cease complaining,Talk no more of foolish love;Think not e'er my heart to reign in,Think not all you say can move.Did I take delight to fetterThrice ten thousand slaves a day,Thrice ten thousand times your bettersGladly would my rule obey.S.Strive not, fairest, to unbind me;Let me keep my pleasing chain:Charms that first to love inclin'd me,Will for ever love maintain.Would you send my heart a roving?First to love I must forbear.Would you have me cease from loving?You must cease from being fair.C.Strephon, leave to talk thus idly;Let me hear of love no more:You mistake Chlorinda widely,Thus to teize her o'er and o'er.Seek not her who still forbids you;To some other tell your moan:Choose where'er your fancy leads you,Let Chlorinda but alone.S.If Chlorinda still denies meThat which none but she can give,Let the whole wide world despise me,'Tis for her alone I live.Grant me yet this one poor favour,With this one request comply;Let us each go on for ever,I to ask, and you deny.C.Since, my Strephon, you so kind are,All pretensions to resign;Trust Chlorinda,—You may find herLess severe than you divine.Strephon struck with joy beholds her,Would have spoke, but knew not how;But he look'd such things as told herMore than all his speech could do.To CHLORINDA.BY THE SAME.SEE, Strephon, what unhappy fateDoes on thy fruitless passion wait,Adding to flame fresh fuel:Rather than thou should'st favour find,The kindest soul on earth's unkind,And the best nature cruel.The goodness, which Chlorinda shews,From mildness and good breeding flows,But must not love be styl'd:Or else 'tis such as mothers try,When, wearied with incessant cry,They still a froward child:She with a graceful mien and air,Genteely civil, yet severe,Bids thee all hopes give o'er.Friendship she offers, pure and free;And who, with such a friend as she,Could want, or wish for more?The cur that swam along the flood,His mouth well fill'd with morsel good,(Too good for common cur!)By visionary hopes betray'd,Gaping to catch a fleeting shade,Lost what he held before.Mark, Strephon, and apply this tale,Lest love and friendship both should fail;Where then would be thy hope?Of hope, quoth Strephon, talk not, friend;And for applying—know, the endOf every cur's a rope.The FABLE of IXION. To CHLORINDA.BY THE SAME.IXION, as the poets tell us,Was one of those pragmatic fellows,Who claim a right to kiss the handOf the best lady in the land;Demonstrating, by dint of reason,That impudence in love's no treason.He let his fancy soar much higher;And ventur'd boldly to aspireTo Juno's high and mighty grace,And woo'd the goddess face to face.What mortal e'er had whims so odd,To think of cuckolding a God?For she was both Jove's wife and sister,And yet the rascal would have kiss'd her.How he got up to heaven's high palace,Not one of all the poets tell us;It must be therefore understood,That he got up which way he could.Nor is it, that I know, recorded,How bows were made, and speeches worded;So, leaving this to each one's guess,I'll only tell you the success.But first I stop awhile to shewWhat happen'd lately here below.Chlorinda, who beyond compareOf all the fair-ones is most fair;Chlorinda, by the Gods design'dTo be the pattern of her kind,With every charm of face and mind;Glanc'd light'ning from her eyes so blue,And shot poor Strephon through and through.He, over head and ears her lover,Try'd all the ways he could to move her;He sigh'd, and vow'd, and pray'd, and cry'd,And did a thousand things beside:She let him sigh, and pray, and cry on—But now hear more about Ixion.The Goddess, proud (as folks report her),Disdain'd that mortal wight should court her,And yet she chose the fool to flatter,To make him fancy some great matter,And hope in time he might get at her;Grac'd him with now and then a smile,But inly scorn'd him all the while;Resolv'd at last a trick to shew him,Seeming to yield, and so undo him.Now which way, do you think, she took?(For do't she would by hook or crook):Why, thus I find it in my book.She call'd a pretty painted cloud,The brightest of the wand'ring crowd;For she, you know, is queen o'th' air,And all the clouds and vapours thereGoverns at will, by nod or summons,As Walpole does the house of commons.This cloud, which came to her stark-naked,She dress'd as fine as hands could make it.For her own wardrobe out she broughtWhate'er was dainty, wove or wrought;A smock which Pallas spun and gave her,Once on a time to gain her favour;A gown that ha'n't on earth its fellow,Of finest blue, and lin'd with yellow,Fit for a goddess to appear in,And not a pin the worse for wearing;A quilted petticoat beside,With whalebone hoop six fathom wide;With these she deck'd the cloud, d'ye see?As like herself, as like could be:So like, that could not I or you knowWhich was the cloud, and which was Juno.Thus dress'd she sent it to the villain,To let him act his wicked will on:Then laugh'd at the poor fool aloud,Who for a goddess grasp'd a cloud.This, you will say, was well done on herT' expose the tempter of her honour—But more of him you need not hear;Only to Strephon lend an ear.He never entertain'd one thoughtWith which a goddess could find fault;His spotless love might be forgivenBy every saint in earth and heaven.Juno herself, though nice and haughty,Would not have judg'd his passion naughty.All this Chlorinda's self confess'd,And own'd his flame was pure and chaste,Read what his teeming Muse brought forth,And prais'd it far beyond its worth:Mildly receiv'd his fond address,And only blam'd his love's excess:Yet she, so good, so sweet, so smiling,So full of truth, so unbeguiling,One way or other still devis'dTo let him see he was despis'd:And when he plum'd, and grew most proud,All was a vapour, all a cloud.A TALE. To CHLORINDA.BY THE SAME.DAME Venus, a daughter of Jove's,And amongst all his daughters most fair,Lost, it seems, to'ther day the two doves,That wafted her car through the air.The dame made a heavy sad rout,Ran about heav'n and earth to condole 'em;And sought high and low to find out,Where the biddyes were stray'd, or who stole 'em.To the god, who the stragglers should meet,She promis'd most tempting fine pay,Six kisses than honey more sweet,And a seventh far sweeter than they.The proposal no sooner was made,But it put all the Gods in a flame;For who would not give all he hadTo be kiss'd by so dainty a dame?To Cyprus, to Paphos, they run,Where the Goddess oft us'd to retire;Some rode round the world with the sun,And search'd every country and shire.But with all their hard running and riding,Not a God of 'em claim'd the reward;For no one could tell tale or tiding,If the doves were alive or were starv'd.At last the sly shooter of men,Young Cupid (I beg the God's pardon),Mamma, your blue birds I have seenIn a certain terrestrial garden.Where, where, my dear child, quickly shew,Quoth the dame, almost out of her wits:Do but go to Chlorinda's, says Cu,And you'll find 'em in shape of pewits.Is it she that hath done me this wrong?Full well I know her, and her arts;She has follow'd the thieving trade long,But I thought she dealt only in hearts.I shall soon make her know, so I shall—And with that to Jove's palace she run,And began like a bedlam to bawl,I am cheated, I am robb'd, I'm undone.Chlorinda, whom none can appproachWithout losing his heart or his senses,Has stol'n the two doves from my coach,And now flaunts it at Venus' expences.She has chang'd the poor things to pewits,And keeps 'em like ord'nary fowls:So, when she robs men of their wits,She turns 'em to asses or owls.I could tell you of many a hundredOf figure, high station, and means,Whom she without mercy has plunder'd,Ever since she came into her teens.But her thefts upon earth I'd have borne,Or have let 'em all pass for mere fable;But nothing will now serve her turn,But the doves out of Venus's stable.Is it fit, let your mightyship say,That I, like some pityful flirt,Should tarry within doors all day,Or else trudge it afoot in the dirt?Is it fit that a mortal should trampleOn me, who am styld queen of beauty?O make her, great Jove, an example,And teach Nimble-fingers her duty.Sir Jove, when he heard her thus rage,For all his great gravity, smil'd;And then, like a judge wise and sage,He began in terms sober and mild.Learn, daughter, to bridle your tongue,Forbear to traduce with your prattleThe fair, who has done you no wrong,And scorns to purloin goods and chattel.She needs neither gewgaw, nor trinket,To carry the world all before her;Her deserts, I would have you to think it,Are enough to make all men adore her.Your doves are elop'd, I confess,And chuse with Chlorinda to dwell;But blame not the lady for this;For sure 'tis no crime to excel.As for them, I applaud their high aims;Having serv'd from the time of their birthThe fairest of heavenly dames,They would now serve the fairest on earth.ODE on LYRIC POETRY.By Dr. MARRIOT.I. 1.INMATE of smoaking cots, whose rustic shed,Within this humble bed,Her twittering progeny contains,The swallow sweeps the plains,Or lightly skims from level lakes the dew.The ringdove ever trueIn plaintive accents tells of unrelenting fate,Far from the raven's croak, and bird of night,That shrieking wings her flightWhen, at his mutter'd rite,Hid in the dusky desart vale,With starting eye, and visage pale,The grimly wizard sees the spectres rise unholy;But haunts the woods that held her beauteous mate,And wooes the Echo soft with murmurs melancholy.I. 2.Sublime alone the feather'd monarch flies,His nest dark mists upon the mountains shrowd;In vain the howling storms arise,When borne on outstretch'd plume aloft he springs,Dashing with many a stroke the parting cloud,Or to the buoyant air commits his wingsFloating with even sail adown the liquid skies:Then darting upward, swift his wings aspire,Where thunders keep their gloomy seat,And lightnings arm'd with heaven's avenging ire.None can the dread artillery meet,Or through the airy region rove,But he who guards the throne of Jove,And grasps the flaming bolt of sacred fire.I. 3.Know, with young Ambition bold,In vain, my Muse, thy dazzled eyes exploreDistant aims, where wont to soar,Their burning way the kindling spirits hold.Heights too arduous wisely shun;Humbler flights thy wings attend;For heaven-taught Genius can alone ascendBack to her native sky,And with directed eagle eyePervade the lofty spheres, and view the blazing sun.II. 1.But hark! o'er all the flower-enamel'd groundWhat music breathes around!I see, I see the virgin trainUnlock their streams again,Rolling to many a vale their liquid lapse along,While at the warbled songWhich holds entranc'd Attention's wakeful ear,Broke are the magic bands of iron sleep.Love, wayward child, oft wont to weep,In tears his robe to steepForgets; and Care that counts his store,Now thinks each mighty business o'er;While sits on ruin'd cities, war's wide-wasting glory,Ambition, ceasing the proud pile to rear,And sighs; unfinish'd leaving half her ample story.II. 2.Then once more, sweet enthusiast, happy lyre,Thy soothing solace deign awhile to bring.I strive to catch the sacred fire,And wake thee emulous on Granta's plain,Where all the Muses haunt his hallow'd spring,And where the Graces shun the sordid train,Scornful of heaven-born arts which thee and peace inspire:On life's sequester'd scenes they silent wait,Nor heed the baseless pomp of power,Nor shining dreams that crowd at Fortune's gate;But smooth th' inevitable hourOf pain, which man is doom'd to know,And teach the mortal mind to glowWith pleasures plac'd beyond the shaft of Fate.II. 3.But, alas! th' amusive reedIll suits the lyre that asks a master's hand,And fond fancies vainly feedA breast that life's more active scenes demand.Sloth ignoble to disclaim'Tis enough: the lyre unstring.At other feet the victor palm I flingIn Granta's glorious shrine;Where crown'd with radiance divineHer smiles shall nurse the Muse; the Muse shall lift her fame.ARION, an ODE.BY THE SAME.I.QUEEN of each sacred sound, sweet child of air,Who sitting thron'd upon the vaulted sky,Dost catch the notes which undulating fly,Oft wafted up to thy exalted sphere,On the soft bosom of each rolling cloud,Charming thy list'ning earWith strains that bid the panting lover die:Or laughing mirth, or tender grief inspire,Or with full chorus loudWhich lift our holy hope, or fan the hero's fire:Enchanting Harmony, 'tis thine to cheerThe soul by woe which sinks opprest,From sorrow's eye to wipe the tear,And on the bleeding wound to pour the balmy rest.II.'Twas when the winds were roaring loud,And Ocean swell'd his billows high,By savage hands condemn'd to die,Rais'd on the stem the trembling Lesbian stood;All pale he heard the tempest blow,As on the watery grave belowHe fix'd his weeping eye.Ah! hateful lust of impious gold,What can thy mighty rage withhold,Deaf to the melting powers of Harmony!But ere the bard unpitied dies,Again his soothing art he tries,Again he sweeps the strings,Slowly sad the notes arise,While thus in plaintive sounds the sweet musician sings.III.From beneath the coral caveCircled with the silver wave,Where with wreaths of emerald crown'dYe lead the festive dance around,Daughters of Venus, hear, and save.Ye Tritons, hear, whose blast can swellWith mighty sounds the twisted shell;And you, ye sister Syrens, hear,Ever beauteous, ever sweet,Who lull the list'ning pilot's earWith magic song, and softly breath'd deceit.By all the Gods who subject rollFrom gushing urns their tribute to the main,By him who bids the winds to roar,By him whose trident shakes the shore,If e'er for you I raise the sacred strainWhen pious mariners your power adore,Daughters of Nereus, hear and save.IV.He sung, and from the coral cave,Circled with the silver wave,With pitying earThe Nereids hear.Gently the waters flowing,The winds now ceas'd their blowing,In silence listening to his tuneful lay.Around the bark's sea-beaten side,The sacred dolphin play'd,And sportive dash'd the briny tide:The joyous omen soon the bard survey'd,Nor fear'd with bolder leap to try the watery way.On his scaly back now riding,O'er the curling billow gliding,Again with bold triumphant handHe bade the notes aspire,Again to joy attun'd the lyre,Forgot each danger past, and reach'd secure the land.HORACE, Book II. Ode II. Quid bellicosus Cantaber, &c. Imitated by Lord BATHWilliam Pulteney, Esq afterwards the celebrated Earl of Bath, was born March 22, 1683-4. He very early was introduced into the House of Commons, and distinguished himself in opposition to the last ministry of Queen Anne. On the accession of King George the First he was appointed Secretary at War, and afterwards Cofferer of the Houshold. In 1725 he detached himself from his connexions at court, and entered so warmly into opposition to the measures of the Crown, that on July 1, 1731, he was struck out of the list of Privy Counsellors with the King's own hand, and at the same time ordered to be put out of every commission of the peace. He succeeded at length in his contest with the minister Sir Robert Walpole, who in 1741 resigned his employments; and Mr. Pulteney was again sworn of the Prvy Council, and created Baron of Heydon, Viscount Pulteney, and Earl of Bath. From this period he lost his popularity; and during the remainder of George the Second's reign passed his life with little notice or respect from the world. At the beginning of the present reign he was much in his Majesty's confidence, but enjoyed that honour a very short time. He died July 7, 1764, at the age of 81, and thereupon his titles became extinct..—PAUL Paul Foley, Esq to — Fazakerly, Esq. These gentlemen were members of the old club at White's. Mr. Fazakerly had made a great fortune in the East Indies. to FAZ.I.NEVER, dear Faz, torment thy brainWith idle fears of France and Spain,Or any thing that's foreign:What can Bavaria do to us,What Prussia's monarch, or the Russ,Or e'en prince Charles of Lorrain?II.Let us be cheerful whilst we can,And legthen out the short-liv'd span,Enjoying every hour.The moon itself we see decay,Beauty's the worse for every day,And so's the sweetest flower.III.How oft, dear Faz, have we been told,That Paul and Faz are both grown old,By young and wanton lasses?Then, since our time is now so short,Let us enjoy the only sportOf tossing off our glasses.IV.From White's we'll move th' expensive scene,And steal away to Richmond Green;There free from noise and riot,Polly each morn shall fill our tea,Spread bread and butter—and then weEach night get drunk in quiet.V.Unless perchance earl Leicester comes,As noisy as a dozen drums,And makes an horrid pother;Else might we quiet sit and quaff,And gently chat, and gayly laughAt this and that and t'other.VI.Br— shall settle what's to pay,Adjust accompts by algebra;I'll always order dinner—Br—, though solemn, yet is sly,And leers at Poll with roguish eyeTo make the girl a sinner.VII.Powell, d'ye hear, let's have the ham,Some chickens and a chine of lamb—And what else?—let's see—look ye—Br— must have his damn'd bouillie,B— fattens on his fricassee,I'll have my water-suchy.VIII.When dinner comes, we'll drink about,No matter who is in, or out,'Till wine, or sleep, o'ertake us;Each man may nod, or nap, or wink,And when it is our turn to drink,Our neighbour then shall wake us.IX.Thus let us live in soft retreat,Nor envy, nor despise the great,Submit to pay our taxes;With peace or war be well content,'Till eas'd by a good parliament,'Till Scroop his hand relaxes.X.Never enquire about the Rhine;But fill your glass, and drink your wine;Hope things may mend in Flanders;The Dutch we know are good allies,So are they all with subsidies,And we have choice commanders.XI.Then here's the King, God bless his grace!Though neither you nor I have place,He hath many a sage adviser;And yet no treason sure's in this,Let who will take the prayer amiss,God send 'em all much wiser!A PANEGYRIC ON ALE.—Mea nec FalernaeTemperant vites, neque FormianiPocula colles.HOR.BY T.

J. DUNCOMBE.O THOU that, on a pointless spear reclin'd,In dusk of eve oft tak'st thy lonely wayWhere Tyber's slow, neglected waters stray,And pour'st thy fruitless sorrows to the wind,Grieving to see his shore no more the seatOf arts and arms, and liberty's retreat.Italia's Genius, rear thy drooping head,Shake off thy trance, and weave an olive crown,For see! a noble guest appears, well knownTo all thy worthies, though in Britain bred;Guard well thy charge, for know, our polish'd isleReluctant spares thee such a son as BOYLE.There, while their sweets thy myrtle groves dispense,Lead to the Sabine or the Tuscan plain,Where playful Horace tun'd his amorous strain,And Tully pour'd the stream of eloquence;Nor fail to crown him with that ivy bloom,Which graceful mantles o'er thy Maro's tomb.At that blest spot, from vulgar cares refin'd,In some soft vision or indulgent dreamInspire his fancy with glorious theme,And point new subjects to his generous mind,At once to charm his country, and improveThe last, the youngest object of his love.But O! mark well his transports in that shade,Where, circled by the bay's unfading green,Amidst a rural and sequestered sceneHis much-lov'd Pliny rests his honour'd head;There, rapt in silence, will he gaze around,And strew with sweetest flow'rs the hallow'd ground.But see! the sage, to mortal view confest,Thrice waves the hand, and says, or seems to say,"The debt I owe thee how shall I repay?"Welcome to Latium's shore, illustrious guest!"Long may'st thou live to grace thy native isle,"Humane in thought, and elegant in style!"While on thy consort I with rapture gaze,"My own Calphurnia rises to my view:"That bliss unknown but to the virtuous few,"Briton! is thine; charm'd with domestic praise,"Thine are those heart-felt joys that sweeten life,"The son, the friend, the daughter, and the wife."Content with such approof, when genial SpringBids the shrill blackbird whistle in the vale,Home may he hasten with a prosperous gale,And Health protect him with her fost'ring wing;So shall Britannia to the wind and seaEntrust no more her fav'rite ORRERY.To CHARLES PRATT, Esq NOW LORD CAMDEN.

JOHN LORD VISCOUNT BOLINGBROKE TO MISS LUCY ATKINSAn orange girl.. Written when he was young.DEAR thoughtless CLARA, to my verse attend,Believe for once thy lover and thy friend;Heaven to each sex has various gifts assign'd,And shewn an equal care of human-kind;Strength does to man's imperial race belong,To yours that beauty which subdues the strong;But as our strength, when misapply'd, is lost,And what should save, urges our ruin most;Just so, when beauty prostituted lies,Of bawds the prey, of rakes th' abandon'd prize,Women no more their empire can maintain,Nor hope, vile slaves of lust, by love to reign.Superior charms but make their case the worse,And what should be their blessing, proves their curse.O nymph! that might, reclin'd on Cupid's breast,Like Psyche, sooth the God of love to rest;Or, if ambition mov'd thee, Jove enthral,Brandish his thunder, and direct its fall;Survey thyself, contemplate every graceOf that sweet form, of that angelic face;Then, CLARA, say, were those delicious charmsMeant for lewd brothels, and rude russians arms?No, CLARA, no! that person, and that mind,Were form'd by nature, and by heaven design'dFor nobler ends; to these return, though late,Return to these, and so avert thy fate.Think, CLARA, think, (nor will that thought be vain)Thy slave, thy HARRY, doom'd to drag his chainOf love, ill-treated and abus'd, that heFrom more inglorious chains might rescue thee.Thy drooping health restor'd; by his fond care,Once more thy beauty its full lustre wear;Mov'd by his love, by his example taught,Soon shall thy soul, once more with virtue fraught,With kind and gen'rous truth thy bosom warm,And thy fair mind, like thy fair person, charm.To virtue thus, and to thyself restor'd,By all admir'd, by one alone ador'd,Be to thy HARRY ever kind and true,And live for him, who more than dies for you.THE CHEAT'S APOLOGY.BY MR. ELLIS.'Tis my vocation, Hal!
SHAKSPEARE.LOOK round the wide world, each profession, you'll find,Hath something dishonest, which myst'ry they call;Each knave points another, at home is stark-blind;Except but his own, there's a cheat in them all:When tax'd with imposture, the charge he'll evade,And like Falstaff pretend he but lives by his trade.The hero ambitious (like Philip's great son,Who wept when he found no more mischief to do)Ne'er scruples a neighbouring realm to o'er-run,While slaughters and carnage his sabre imbrue.Of rapine and murder the charge he'll evade,For conquest is glorious, and fighting his trade.The statesman, who steers by wise Machiavel's rules,Is ne'er to be known by his tongue or his face;They're traps by him us'd to catch credulous fools,And breach of his promise he counts no disgrace;But policy calls it, reproach to evade,For flatt'ry's his province, cajoling his trade.The priest will instruct you this world to despise,With all its vain pomp, for a kingdom on high;While earthly preferments are chiefly his prize,And all his pursuits give his doctrine the lye;He'll plead you the gospel, your charge to evade:The lab'rer's entitled to live by his trade.The lawyer, as oft on the wrong side as right,Who tortures for fee the true sense of the laws,While black he by sophistry proves to be white,And falsehood and perjury lists in his cause,With steady assurance all crime will evade:His client's his care, and he follows his trade.The sons of Machaon, who thirsty for goldThe patient past cure visit thrice in a day,Write largely the Pharmacop league to uphold,While poverty's left to diseases a prey,Are held in repute for their glitt'ring parade:Their practice is great, and they shine in their trade.Since then in all stations imposture is found,No one of another can justly complain;The coin he receives will pass current around,And where he is cousen'd he cousens again:But I, who for cheats this apology made,Cheat myself by my rhyming, and starve by my trade.SONG.BY THE SAME.AS Chloe ply'd her needle's art,A purple drop the spearMade from her heedless finger start,And from her eyes a tear.Ah! might but Chloe by her smartBe taught for mine to feel;Mine caus'd by Cupid's piercing dart,More sharp than pointed steel!Then I her needle would adore,Love's arrow it should be,Indu'd with such a subtle pow'rTo reach her heart for me.ANOTHER.BY THE SAME.SUE venal Belinda to grant you the blessingAs Jove courted Danae, or vain's your addressing;For love, she asserts, all that's gen'rous inspires,And therefore rich tokens of love she requires.Such suitors as nothing but ardours are boasting,Will ne'er reach Elysium, but ever be coasting.Like pennyless ghosts, deny'd passage by Charon,They'll find, without fee, unrelenting the fair-one.But give me the nymph not ungrateful to wooing,Who love pays with love, and caresses with cooing,By whom a true heart is accepted as sterling,And Cupid alone makes her lover her darling.TO MR. GRENVILLE, ON HIS INTENDED RESIGNATION.BY RICHARD BERENGER, EsqA Wretch, tir'd out with Fortune's blows,Resolv'd at once to end his woes;And, like a thoughtless silly elf,In the next pond to drown himself.'Tis fit, quoth he, my life should end,The cruel world is not my friend;I have nor meat, nor drink, nor cloaths,But want each joy that wealth bestows;Besides, I hold my life my own,And when I please may lay it down;A wretched hopeless thing am I,Forgetting, as forgot, I'll die.Not so, said one who stood behind,And heard him thus disclose his mind;Consider well, pray, what you do,And think what numbers live in you:If you go drown, your woes to ease,Pray, who will keep your lice and fleas?On you alone their lives depend,With you they live, with you must end.On great folks thus the little live,And in their sunshine bask and thrive:But when those suns no longer shine,The helpless insects droop and pine.Oh, GRENVILLE, then this tale apply,Nor drown yourself left I should die:Compassionate your louse's case,And keep your own to save his place.TO MR. GARRICK, On his erecting a Temple and Statue to SHAKSPEAREIn his garden, by the Thames side, at Hampton.BY THE SAME.—Viridi in campo signum de marmore ponamPropter aquam, tardis ingens ubi flexibus erratThsis, et muliâ praetexit arundine ripas;In medo mihi SHAKSPEARE erit, templumque tenebit.VIRGIL.WHERE yonder trees rise high in cheerful air,Where yonder banks eternal verdure wear,And opening flow'rs diffusing sweets aroundPaint with their vivid hues the happy ground;While Thames majestic rolls the meads between,And with his silver current crowns the scene:There GARRICK, satiate of well-earn'd applause,From crowds and shouting theatres withdraws;There courts the Muse, turns o'er th' instructive page,And meditates new triumphs for the stage.Thine, SHAKSPEARE, chief—for thou must ever shineHis pride, his boast, unequall'd and divine.There too thy vot'ry, to thy merit just,Hath rais'd the dome, and plac'd thy honour'd bust,Bidding the pile to future times proclaimHis veneration for thy mighty name.A place more fit his zeal could never findThan this fair spot, an emblem of the mind—As hill and dale there charm the wond'ring eye,Such sweet variety thy scenes supply—Like the tall trees sublime thy genius tow'rs,Sprightly thy fancy, as the opening flow'rs;While, copious as the tide Thames pours along,Flow the sweet numbers of thy heav'nly song,Serenely pure, and yet divinely strong—Look down, great shade, with pride this tribute see,The hand that pays it makes it worthy thee—As fam'd Apelles was allow'd aloneTo paint the form august of Philip's son,None but a GARRICK can, O bard divine!Lay a fit offering on thy hallow'd shrine.To speak thy worth is his peculiar boast,He best can tell it, for he feels it most.Blest bard! thy fame through every age shall grow.Till Nature cease to charm, or Thames to flow.Thou too, with him, whose fame thy talents raise,Shalt share our wonder, and divide our praise;Blended with this thy merits rise to view,And half thy SHAKSPEARE'S fame to thee is due:Unless the actor with the bard conspire,How impotent his strength, how faint his fire!One boasts the mine, one brings the gold to light,And the Muse triumphs in the Actor's might;Too weak to give her own conceptions birth,Till all-expressive Action call them forth.Thus the sweet pipe, mute in itself, no soundSends forth, nor breathes its pleasing notes around;But if some swain, with happy skill endu'd,Inspire with animating breath the wood,Wak'd into voice, it pours its tuneful strains,The harmony divine enchants the plains.Quod spiro, et placeo, si placeo, tuum est—

When he speaksEach aged ear plays truant at his tales,And younger hearings are quite ravished,So voluble is his discourse—GentleAs Zephyr blowing underneath the violet,Not wagging its sweet head—yet as rough,(His noble blood enchaff'd) as the rude wind,That by the top doth take the mountain pine,And make him stoop to th' vale.—'Tis wonderfulThat an invisible instinct should frame himTo loyalty, unlearn'd: honour untaught;Civility not seen in other; knowledgeThat wildly grows in him, but yields a cropAs if it had been sown.

D.LED by the Muse, my step pervadesThe sacred haunts, the peaceful shadesWhere Art and Sculpture reign:I see, I see, at their command,The living stones in order stand,And marble breathe through every vein!Time breaks his hostile scythe; he sighsTo find his pow'r malignant fled;"And what avails my dart, he cries,"Since these can animate the dead?"Since wak'd to mimic life again in stone"The patriot seems to speak, the hero frown."There Virtue's silent train are seen,Fast fix'd their looks, erect their mien,Lo! while with more than stoic soul,The Socrates, who was condemned to die by poison.Attic sage exhausts the bowl,A pale suffusion shades his eyes,'Till by degrees the marble dies!See there the injur'd Seneca, born at Corduba, who, according to Pliny, was orator, poet, and philosopher. He bled to death in the bath.poet bleed!Ah! see he droops his languid head!What starting nerves, what dying pain,What horror freezes every vein!These are thy works, O Sculpture! thine to shewIn rugged rock a feeling sense of woe.Yet not alone such themes demandThe Phydian stroke, the Daedal hand;I view with melting eyesA softer scene of grief display'd,While from her breast the duteous maidHer infant sire with food supplies.In pitying stone she weeps, to seeHis squalid hair, and galling chains:And trembling, on her bended knee,His hoary head her hand sustains;While every look and sorrowing feature proveHow soft her breast, how great her filial love.Lo! there the wild Semiramis, cum ci circa cultum capitis sui occupatae nunciatum esset Babylonem defecisse; alterâ parte crinium adhuc solutâ protinus ad eam expugnandam cucurrit: nee prius decorem capillorum in ordinem quam tantam urbem in potestatem suam redegit: quocircà statua ejus Babylone posita est, &c.

what praise were mine!Illustrious sage! who first could'st tellWherein the powers of Music dwell;And every magic chain untie,That binds the soul of Harmony!To thee, when mould'ring in the dust,To thee shall swell the breathing bust:Shall here (for this reward thy merits claim)"Stand next to place in Newton, as in fame."TRUE RESIGNATION.Aequam memento rebus in arduisServare mentem.HORAT.By Mr. HYLTON.WHEN Colin's good dame, who long held him a tug,And defeated his hopes by the help of the jug,Had taken too freely the cheeruping cup,And repeated the dose 'till it laid her quite up;Colin sent for the doctor: with sorrowful faceHe gave him his fee, and he told him her case.Quoth Galen, I'll do what I can for your wife;But indeed she's so bad, that I fear for her life.In counsel there's safety—e'n send for another;For if she should die, folks will make a strange pother,And say that I lost her for want of good skill—Or of better advice—or, in short, what they will.Says Colin, your judgment there's none can dispute;And if physic can cure her—I know yours will do't.But if, after all, she should happen to die,And they say that you kill'd her—I'll swear 'tis a lye:'Tis the husband's chief business, whatever ensue;And whoever finds fault—I'll be shot —if I do.An EPISTLE from the King of PRUSSIA to Monsieur VOLTAIRE. 1757.CROYEZ que si j'etois, Voltaire,Particulier aujourdhui,Me contentant du necessaire,Je verrois envoler la Fortune legere,Et m'en mocquerois comme lui.Je connois l' ennui des grandeurs,Le fardeau des devoirs, le jargon des flateurs,Et tout l' amas des petitesses,Et leurs genres et leurs especes,Dont il faut s' occuper dans le sein des honneurs.Je meprise la vaine glorie,Quoique Poëte et Sonverain,Quand du ciseau fatal retranchant mon dstiAtropos m' aura vu plonge dans la nuit noire,Que m' importe l' honneur incertainDe vivre apres ma mort au temple de Memoire:Un instant de bonheur vaut mille ans dans I'histoire.Nos destins sont ils donc si beaux?Le doux Plaisir et la Mollesse,La vive et naïve AllegresseOnt toujours fui des grands, la pompe, et les faisceaux,Nes pour la liberté leurs troupes enchantressesPreferent l' aimable paresseAux austeres devoirs guides de nos travaux.Aussi la Fortune volageN' a jamais cause mes ennuis,Soit qu' elle m' agaçe, ou qu' elle m' outrage.Je dormirai toutes les nuitsEn lui refusant mon hommage.Mais notre etat nous fait loi,Il nous oblige, il nous engageA mesurer notre courage,Sur ce qu' exige notre emploi.Voltaire dans son hermitage,Dans un païs dont l' heritageEst son antique bonne foi,Peut s' addonner en paix a la vertu du sageDont Platon nous marque la loi.Pour moi menacé du naufrage,Je dois, en affrontant l' orage,Penser, vivre, et mourir en Roi.Translated into EnglishBy JOHN GILBERT COOPER, Esq.VOLTAIRE, believe me, were I nowIn private life's calm station plac'd,Let Heav'n for nature's wants allow,With cold indiff'rence would I viewChanging Fortune's winged haste,And laugh at her caprice like you.Th' insipid farce of tedious state,Imperial duty's real weight,The faithless courtier's supple bow,The fickle multitude's caress,And the great Vulgar's Littleness,By long experience well I know:And, though a Prince and Poet born,Vain blandishments of glory scorn.For when the ruthless shears of FateHave cut my life's precarious thread,And rank'd me with th' unconscious dead,What will't avail that I was great,Or that th' uncertain tongue of FameIn Mem'ry's temple chaunts my name?One blissful moment whilst we liveWeighs more than ages of renown;What then do Potentates receiveOf good, peculiarly their own?Sweet Ease and unaffected Joy,Domestic Peace, and sportive Pleasure,The regal throne and palace fly,And, born for liberty, preferSoft silent scenes of lovely leisure,To, what we Monarchs buy so dear,The thorny pomp of scepter'd care.My pain or bliss shall ne'er dependOn fickle Fortune' casual flight,For, whether she's my foe or friend,In calm repose I'll pass the night;And ne'er by watchful homage ownI court her smile, or fear her frown.But from our stations we deriveUnerring precepts how to live,And certain deeds each rank calls forth,By which is measur'd human worth.Voltaire, within his private cell,In realms where ancient honestyIs patrimonial property,And sacred Freedom loves to dwell,May give up all his peaceful mind,Guided by Plato's deathless page,In silent solitude resign'dTo the mild virtues of a Sage;But I, 'gainst whom wild whirlwinds wageFierce war with wreck-denouncing wing,Must be, to face the tempest's rage,In thought, in life, in death a king.On seeing John Williams was consecrated bishop of Lincoln, Nov. 11, 1621; was translated to York, Dec. 4, 1641; died March 25, 1649; and was buried at Landegay, near Bangor. Archbishop WILLIAMS'S Monument in CARNARVONSHIRE.By Dr. DAVIES.IN that remote and solitary place,Which the seas wash, and circling hills embrace,Where those lone walls amid the groves arise,All that remains of thee, fam'd Williams, lies.Thither, sequester'd shade, creation's nook,The wand'ring Muse her pensive journey took,Curious to trace the statesman to his home,And moralize at leisure o'er his tomb:She came not, with the pilgrim, tears to shed,Mutter a vow, or trifle with a bead,But such a sadness did her thoughts employ,As lives within the neighbourhood of joy.Reflecting much upon the mighty shade,His glories, and his miseries, she said:"How poor the lot of the once-honour'd dead!Perhaps the dust is Williams, that we tread.The learn'd, ambitious, politic, and great,Statesman, and prelate, this, alas! thy fate.Could not thy Lincoln yield her pastor room?Could not thy York supply thee with a tomb?Was it for this thy lofty genius soar'd,Caress'd by monarchs and by crowds ador'd?For this, thy hand o'er rivals could prevail,Grasping by turns the crosier and the He was made lord keeper of the great seal July 20, 1621. seal?Who dar'd on Laud's meridian pow'r to frown,And on aspiring Buckingham look down.This thy gay morn,—but ere the day declineClouds gather, and adversity is thine.Doom'd to behold thy country's fierce alarms,What had thy trembling age to do with arms?Thy lands dragoon'd, thy palaces in dust,Why was thy life protracted to be curst?The king in chains,—thyself by lawless mightStript of all pow'r, and exil'd from thy right.Awhile the venerable hero stood,And stemm'd with quiv'ring limbs the boist'rous flood;At length, o'ermatch'd by injuries and time,Stole from the world, and sought his native clime.Cambria for him with moans her region fills:She wept his downfall from a thousand hills:Tender embrac'd her prelate though undone,Stretch'd out her mother-rocks to hide her son:Search'd, while alive, each vale for his repast,And, when he died, receiv'd him in her breast.Envied Ambition! what are all thy schemes,But waking misery, or pleasing dreams,Sliding and tottering on the heights of state!The subject of this verse declares thy fate.Great as he was, you see how small the gain,A burial so obscure, a Muse so mean."Extempore Verses upon a Trial of Skill between the two great Masters of Defence, Messieurs FIGG and SUTTON.By Dr. BYROMDr. John Byrom was a younger son of Mr. Edward Byrom, of Kersal, in the county of Lancaster, linen-draper. He received his education at Merchant Taylor's School, from whence he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became a pensioner, July 6, 1708. Having taken his degrees in arts, he was chosen fellow of his college in 1714; but not inclining to enter into holy orders, he was obliged to quit his place in 1716, and soon afterwards married his cousin Miss Elizabeth Byrom. This union involved him in more expence than he was able to support, and he was compelled to have recourse to teaching short-hand for the maintenance of his family. After some years his elder brother died, and the family estate devolved to him. This occased him first to relax his attention to business, and then to relinquish . He died at Manchester September 26, 1763..I.LONG was the great Figg, by the prize-fighting swains,Sole monarch acknowledg'd of Marybone plains:To the towns, far and near, did his valour extend,And swam down the river from Thame to Gravesend;Where liv'd Mr. Sutton, pipemaker by trade,Who hearing that Figg was thought such a stout blade,Resolv'd to put in for a share of his fame,And so sent to challenge the champion of Thame.II.With alternate advantage two trials had past,When they fought out the rubbers on Wednesday last.To see such a contest the house was so full,There hardly was room left to thrust in your skull.With a prelude of cudgels we first were saluted,And two or three shoulders most handsomely fluted;'Till weary at last with inferior disasters,All the company cry'd, Come, the masters, the masters.III.Whereupon the bold Sutton first mounted the stage,Made his honours as usual, and yearn'd to engage;Then Figg, with a visage so fierce, yet sedate,Came and enter'd the lists with his fresh-shaven pate;Their arms were encircled with armigers too,With a red ribbon Sutton's, and Figg's with a blue.Thus adorn'd the two heroes, 'twixt shoulder and elbow,Shook hands, and went to't, and the word it was Bilboe.IV.Sure such a concern in the eyes of spectatorsWas never yet seen in our amphi-theatres,Our commons and peers from their several places,To half an inch distance all pointed their faces;While the rays of old Phoebus that shot thro' the sky-light.Seem'd to make on the stage a new kind of twilight;And the Gods, without doubt, if one could but have seen 'em,Were peeping there through, to do justice between 'em.V.Figg struck the first stroke, and with such a vast fury,That he broke his huge weapon in twain, I assure you;And if his brave rival this blow had not warded,His head from his shoulders had quite been discarded.Figg arm'd him again, and they took t' other tilt,And then Sutton's blade ran away from its hilt;The weapons were frighted, but as for the men,In truth they ne'er minded, but at it again.VI.Such a force in their blows, you'd have thought it a wonderEvery stroke they receiv'd did not cleave 'em asunder.Yet so great was their courage, so equal their skill,That they both seem'd as safe as a thief in a mill;While in doubtful attention dame Victory stood,And which side to take could not tell for her blood,But remain'd like the ass, 'twixt the bundles of hay,Without ever stirring an inch either way.VII.'Till Jove to the Gods signified his intentionIn a speech that he made 'em too tedious to mention;But the upshot on't was, that at that very boutFrom a wound in Figg's side the hot blood spouted out;Her ladyship then seem'd to think the case plain,But Figg stepping forth with a sullen disdain,Shew'd the gash, and appeal'd to the company round,If his own broken sword had not given him the wound.VIII.That bruises and wounds a man's spirit should touch,With danger so little, with honour so much!Well, they both took a dram, and return'd to the battle,And with a fresh fury they made the swords rattle;While Sutton's right arm was observed to bleed,By a touch from his rival, so Jove had decreed;Just enough for to shew that his blood was not ichor.But made up, like Figg's, of the common red-liquor.IX.Again they both rush'd with as equal a fire on,Till the company cry'd, Hold, enough of cold iron,To the quarter-staff now, lads. So first having dram'd it,They took to their wood, and i'faith never shamm'd it.The first bout they had was so fair, and so handsome,That to make a fair bargain, was worth a king's ransom;And Sutton such bangs on his neighbour imparted,Would have made any fibres but Figg's to have smarted.X.Then after that bout they went on to another—But the matter must end on some fashion, or other;So Jove told the Gods he had made a decree,That Figg should hit Sutton a stroke on the knee.Though Sutton disabled as soon as he hit himWould still have fought on, but Jove would not permit him;'Twas his fate, not his fault, that constrain'd him to yield,And thus the great Figg became lord of the field.A LETTER FROM CAMBRIDGE TO MASTER HENRY ARCHER, A YOUNG GENTLEMAN AT ETON SCHOOL.BY DR. LITTLETONDr. Edward Littleton was educated upon the Royal foundation at Eton School, from whence he was transplanted to King's College, Cambridge, in the year 1716. After four years residence at the University, he was recalled to Eton as an assistant in the school, where he so greatly acquired the respect of the provost and fellows, that in 1727 they elected him into their society, and presented him to the living of Maple Derham, in Oxfordshire. On June the 9th, 1730, he was appointed chaplain in ordinary to their Majesties, and in the same year took his Doctor of Laws degree at Cambridge. He died of a fever in the year 1734, and was buried in his own parish church of Maple Derham..THOUGH plagu'd with algebraic lectures,And astronomical conjectures,Wean'd from the sweets of poetryTo scraps of dry philosophy,You see, dear Hal, I've found a timeT' express my thoughts to you in rhyme.For why, my friend, should distant parts,Or time, disjoin united hearts;Since, though by intervening spaceDepriv'd of speaking face to face,By faithful emissary letterWe may converse as well, or better?And, not to stretch a narrow fancy,To shew what pretty things I can say,(As some will strain at simile,First work it fine, and then apply;Add Butler's rhymes to Prior's thoughts,And choose to mimic all their faults,By head and shoulders bring in a stick,To shew their knack at hudibrastic,)I'll tell you, as a friend and irony,How here I spend my time, and money;For time and money go togetherAs sure as weathercock and weather;And thrifty guardians all allowThis grave reflection to be true,That whilst we pay so dear for learningThose weighty truths we've no concern in,The spark who squanders time awayIn vain pursuits, and fruitless play,Not only proves an arrant blockhead,But, what's much worse, as out of pocket.Whether my conduct bad, or good is,Judge from the nature of my studies.No more majestic Virgil's heights,Nor tow'ring Milton's loftier flights,Nor courtly Horace's rebukes,Who banters vice with friendly jokes,Nor Congreve's life, nor Cowley's fire,Nor all the beauties that conspireTo place the greenest bays uponTh' immortal brows of Addison;Prior's inimitable ease,Nor Pope's harmonious numbers please;How can poetic flow'rs abound,How spring in philosophic ground?Homer indeed (if I would shew it)Was both philosopher and poet,But tedious philosophic chaptersQuite stifle my poetic raptures,And I to Phoebus bade adieuWhen first I took my leave of you.Now algebra, geometry,Arithmetic, astronomy,Optics, chronology, and statics,All tiresome points of mathematics;With twenty harder names than these,Disturb my brains, and break my peace.All seeming inconsistenciesAre nicely solv'd by a's, and b's;Our senses are disprov'd by prisms,Our arguments by syllogisms.If I should confidently writeThis ink is black, this paper white,Or, to express myself yet fuller,Should say that black, or white's a colour;They'd contradict it, and perplex oneWith motion, light, and its reflection,And solve th' apparent falsehood byThe curious texture of the eye.Should I the poker want, and take it,When't looks as hot, as fire can make it,And burn my finger, and my coat,They'd flatly tell me, 'tis not hot;The fire, say they, has in't, 'tis true,The pow'r of causing heat in you;But no more heat's in fire that heats you,Than there is pain in stick that beats you.Thus too philosophers expoundThe names of odour, taste, and sound;The salts and juices in all meatAffect the tongues of them that eat,And by some secret poignant powerGive them the taste of sweet, and sour.Carnations, violets, and rosesCause a sensation in our noses;But then there's none of us can tellThe things themselves have taste, or smell.So when melodious Mason sings,Or Gething tunes the trembling strings,Or when the trumpet's brisk alarmsCall forth the cheerful youth to arms,Convey'd through undulating airThe music's only in the air.We're told how planets roll on high,How large their orbits, and how nigh;I hope in little time to knowWhether the moon's a cheese, or no;Whether the man in't, as some tell ye,With beef and carrots fills his belly;Why like a lunatic confin'dHe lives at distance from mankind;When he at one good hearty shakeMight whirl his prison off his back;Or like a maggot in a nutFull bravely eat his passage out.Who knows what vast discoveriesFrom such inquiries might arise?But feuds, and tumults in the nationDisturb such curious speculation.Cambridge from furious broils of state,Foresees her near-approaching fate;Her surest patrons are remov'd,And her triumphant foes approv'd.No more! this due to friendship take,Not idly writ for writing's sake;No longer question my respect,Nor call this short delay neglect;At least excuse it, when you seeThis pledge of my sincerity;For one who rhymes to make you easy,And his invention strains to please you,To shew his friendship cracks his brains,Sure is a mad-man if he feigns.THE INDOLENT.WHAT self-sufficiency and false contentDenumb the senses of the indolent!Dead to all purposes of good, or ill,Alive alone in an unactive will.His only vice in no good action lies,And his sole virtue is his want of vice.Business he deems too hard, trifles too easy,And doing nothing finds himself too busy.Silence he cannot bear, noise is distraction,Noise kills with bustle, silence with reflection;No want he feels,—what has he to pursue?To him 'tis less suffer, than to do.The busy world's a fool, the learn'd a sot,And his sole hope to be by all forgot:Wealth is procur'd with toil, and kept with fear,Knowledge by labour purchas'd costs too dear;Friendship's a clog, and family a jest,A wife but a bad bargain at the best;Honour a bubble, subject to a breath,And all engagements vain since null'd by death;Thus all the wise esteem, he can despise,And caring not, 'tis he alone is wise:Yet, all his wish possessing, finds no rest,And only lives to know, he never can be blest.THE SONG OF SIMEON PARAPHRASED.BY MR. MERRICK.'TIS enough—the hour is come.Now within the silent tombLet this mortal frame decay,Mingled with its kindred clay;Since thy mercies, oft of oldBy thy chosen seers foretold,Faithful now and stedfast prove,God of truth and God of love!Since at length my aged eyeSees the day-spring from on high.Son of Righteousness, to theeLo! the nations bow the knee,And the realms of distant kingsOwn the healing of thy wings.Those whom death had overspreadWith his dark and dreary shade,Lift their eyes, and from afarHail the light of Jacob's star;Waiting till the promis'd rayTurn their darkness into day.See the beams intensely shedShine o'er Sion's favour'd head.Never may they hence remove,God of truth and God of love!ON THE INVENTION OF LETTERS.TELL me what Genius did the art invent,The lively image of the voice to paint;Who first the secret how to colour sound,And to give shape to reason, wisely found;With bodies how to cloath ideas, taught;And how to draw the picture of a thought:Who taught the hand to speak, the eye to hearA silent language roving far and near;Whose softest noise outstrips loud thunder's sound,And spreads her accents through the world's vast round;A voice heard by the deaf, spoke by the dumb,Whose echo reaches long, long time to come;Which dead men speak as well as those alive—Tell me what Genius did this art contrive.THE ANSWER.THE noble art to Cadmus owes its riseOf painting words, and speaking to the eyes;He first in wond'rous magic fetters boundThe airy voice, and stopp'd the flying sound;The various figures, by his pencil wrought,Gave colour, form, and body to the thought.ON WIT.TRUE wit is like the brilliant stoneDug from the Indian mine;Which boasts two various powers in one,To cut as well as shine.Genius, like that, if polish'd right,With the same gifts abounds;Appears at once both keen and bright,And sparkles while it wounds.ON A SPIDER.BY DR. LITTLETON.ARTIST, who underneath my tableThy curious texture hast display'd!Who, if we may believe the fable,Wert once a lovely blooming maid!Insidious, restless, watchful spider,Fear no officious damsel's broom;Extend thy artful fabric wider,And spread thy banners round my room.Swept from the rich man's costly cieling,Thou'rt welcome to my homely roof;Here may'st thou find a peaceful dwelling,And undisturb'd attend thy woof.Whilst I thy wond'rous fabric stare at,And think on hapless poet's fate;Like thee confin'd to lonely garret,And rudely banish'd rooms of state.And as from out thy tortur'd bodyThou draw'st thy slender string with pain;So does he labour, like a noddy,To spin materials from his brain.He for some fluttering tawdry creature,That spreads her charms before his eye;And that's a conquest little betterThan thine o'er captive butterfly.Thus far 'tis plain we both agree,Perhaps our deaths may better shew it;'Tis ten to one but penuryEnds both the spider and the poet.THE PLAY-THING CHANGED.KITTY's charming voice and face,Syren-like, first caught my fancy;Wit and humour next take place,And now I doat on sprightly Nancy.Kitty tunes her pipe in vain,With airs most languishing and dying;Calls me false ungrateful swain,And tries in vain to shoot me flying.Nancy with resistless art,Always humorous, gay, and witty,Has talk'd herself into my heart,And quite excluded tuneful Kitty.Ah, Kitty! Love, a wanton boy,Now pleas'd with song, and now with prattle,Still longing for the newest toy,Has chang'd his whistle for a rattle.THE FABLE OF JOTHAM: TO THE BOROUGH-HUNTERS.By RICHARD OWEN CAMBRIDGE, EsqJotham's fable of the trees is the oldest that is extant, and as beautiful as any which have been made since that time.
ADDISON.JUDGES, Chap. ix. ver. 8.OLD Plumb, who, though blest in his Kentish retreat,Still thrives by his oil-shop in Leadenhall-street,With a Portugal merchant, a knight by creation,From a borough in Cornwall received invitation.Well-assur'd of each vote, well equipt from the alley,In quest of election-adventures they sally.Though much they discours'd, the long way to beguile,Of the earthquakes, the Jews, and the change of the style,Of the Irish, the stocks, and the lott'ry committee,They came silent and tir'd into Exeter city."Some books, prithee landlord, to pass a dull hour;"No nonsense of parsons, or methodists sour,"No poetical stuff, a damn'd jingle of rhymes,"But some pamphlet that's new, and a touch on the times.""O Lord! says mine host, you may hunt the town round,"I question if any such thing can be found:"I never was ask'd for a book by a guest;"And I am sure I have all the great folk in the West."None of these, to my knowledge, e'er call'd for a book;"But see, Sir, the woman with fish, and the cook:"Here's the fattest of carp; shall we dress you a brace?"Would you have any soals, or a mullet, or place?""A place, quoth the knight, we must have to be sure,"But first let us see that our Borough's secure;"We'll talk of the place when we've settled the poll:"They may dress us for supper the mullet and soal."But do you, my good landlord, look over your shelves,"For a book we must have, we're so tired of ourselves.""In troth, Sir, I ne'er had a book in my life,"But the prayer-book and bible I bought for my wife.""Well! the bible must do; but why don't you take in"Some monthly collection, the new magazine?"The bible was brought, and laid out on the table,And open'd at Jotham's most apposite fable.Sir Freeport began with this verse, though no rhyme—"The trees of the forest went forth on a time,(To what purpose our candidates scarce could expect,For it was not, they found, to transplant—but ELECT)"To the olive and fig-tree their deputies came,"But by both were refus'd, and their answer the same:"Quoth the olive, Shall I leave my fatness and oil"For an unthankful office, a dignify'd toil?"Shall I leave, quoth the fig-tree, my sweetness and fruit,"To be envy'd or slav'd in so vain a pursuit?"Thus rebuff'd and surpriz'd they apply'd to the vine:"He answer'd; Shall I leave my grapes and my wine,"(Wine the sovereign cordial of god and of man)"To be made or the tool or head of a clan?"At last, as it always falls out in a scramble,"The mob gave the cry for a bramble! a bramble!"A bramble for ever! O! chance unexpected!"But bramble prevail'd, and was duly elected.""O! ho! quoth the knight with a look most profound,"Now I see there's some good in good books to be found."I wish I had read this same bible before:"Of long miles at the least 'twould have sav'd us fourscore."You, Plumb, with your olives and oil might have staid,"And myself might have tarried my wines to unlade."What have merchants to do from their business to ramble!"Your electioneer-errant should still be a bramble."Thus ended at once the wise comment on Jotham,And our citizens' jaunt to the borough of Gotham.AN ELEGY WRITTEN IN AN EMPTY ASSEMBLY-ROOM.BY THE SAME.— Semperque relinqueSola sibi —VIRG.ADVERTISEMENT.
This poem being a parody on the most remarkable passages in the well-known epistle of Eloisa to Abelard, it was thought unnecessary to transcribe any lines from that poem, which is in the hands of all, and in the memory of most readers.IN scenes where HALLET'S Hallet and Bromwich were two eminent upholsterers. The former purchased the celebrated seat of the duke of Chandos at Cannons, near Edgware, on the site of which he built himself a house on his retiring from business. genius has combin'dWith BROMWICH to amuse and cheer the mind;Amid this pomp of cost, this pride of art,What mean these sorrows in a female heart?Ye crowded walls, whose well-enlighten'd roundWith lovers sighs and protestations sound;Ye pictures, flatter'd by the learn'd and wise,Ye glasses, ogled by the brightest eyes;Ye cards, which beauties by their touch have blest,Ye chairs, which peers and ministers have prest;How are ye chang'd! like you my fate I moan;Like you, alas! neglected and alone—For ah! to me alone no card is come,I must not go abroad—and cannot be at home.Blest be that social pow'r, the first who pair'dThe erring footman with th' unerring card!'Twas VENUS sure; for by their faithful aidThe whisp'ring lover meets the blushing maid;From solitude they give the cheerful callTo the choice supper, or the sprightly ball:Speed the soft summons of the gay and fair,From distant Bloomsbury to Grosvenor's square;And bring the colonel to the tender hour,From the parade, the senate, or the Tower!Ye records, patents of our worth and pride!Our daily lesson, and our nightly guide!Where'er ye stand, dispos'd in proud array,The vapours vanish, and the heart is gay;But when no cards the chimney-glass adorn,The dismal void with heart-felt shame we mourn;Conscious neglect inspires a sullen gloom,And brooding sadness fills the slighted room.If but some happier female's card I've seen,I swell with rage, or sicken with the spleen;While artful pride conceals the bursting tear,With some forc'd banter or affected sneer:But now, grown desp'rate and beyond all hope,I curse the ball, the dutchess, and the pope.And, as the loads of borrow'd plate go by,Tax it! ye greedy ministers, I cry.How shall I feel, when Sol resigns his lightTo this proud splendid goddess of the night!Then when her aukward guests in measure beatThe crowded floors, which groan beneath their feet;What thoughts in solitude shall then possessMy tortur'd mind, or soften my distress!Not all that envious malice can suggestWill sooth the tumults of my raging breast.(For envy's lost amid the numerous train,And hisses with her hundred snakes in vain)Though with contempt each despicable soulSingly I view,—I must revere the whole.The Methodist in her peculiar lot,The world forgetting, by the world forgot,Though single happy, though alone is proud,She thinks of heav'n (she thinks not of a crowd);And if she ever feels a vap'rish qualm,Some The title of a book of modern devotion.drop of honey, or some holy balm,The pious prophet of her sect distils,And her pure soul seraphic rapture fills;Grace shines around her with serenest beams,And whisp'ring WHITEFIELD prompts her golden dreams.Far other dreams my sensual soul employ,While conscious nature tastes unholy joy:I view the traces of experienc'd charms,And clasp the regimentals in my arms.To dream last night I clos'd my blubber'd eyes;Ye soft allusions, dear deceits, arise;Alas! no more. Methinks I wand'ring goTo distant quarters 'midst the Highland snow;To the dark inn where never wax-light burns,Where in smoak'd tap'stry faded DIDO mourns;To some assembly in a country town,And meet the colonel—in a parson's gown—I start—I shriek—O! could I on my waking brain impose,Or but forget at least my present woes!Forget 'em!—how!—each rattling coach suggestsThe loath'd ideas of the crowding guests.To visit—were to publish my disgrace;To meet the spleen in every other place;To join old maids and dowagers forlorn;And be at once their comfort and their scorn!For once, to read with this distemper'd brain,Ev'n modern novels lend their aid in vain.My MANDOLINE—what place can music findAmid the discord of my restless mind?How shall I waste this time which slowly flies!How lull to slumber my reluctant eyes!This night the happy and th' unhappy keepVigils alik,—NORFOLK has murder'd sleep.The FAKEER: A TALE.BY THE SAME.A FAKEER (a religious well known in the East,Not much like a parson, still less like a priest)With no canting, no sly jesuitical arts,Field-preaching, hypocrisy, learning, or parts,By a happy refinement in mortification,Grew the oracle, saint, and the pope of his nation.But what did he do this esteem to acquire?Did he torture his head or his bosom with fire?Was his neck in a portable pillory cas'd?Did he fasten a chain to his leg or his waist?No. His holiness rose to his sovereign pitchBy the merit of running long nails in his breech.A wealthy young Indian, approaching the shrine,Thus in banter accosts the prophetic divine:This tribute accept for your int'rest with FO,Whom with torture you serve, and whose will you must know:To your suppliant disclose his immortal decree;Tell me which of the heav'ns is allotted for me.FAKEER.Let me first know your merits.INDIAN.I strive to be just:To be true to my friend, to my wife, to my trust:In religion I duly observe every form:With a heart to my country devoted and warm:I give to the poor, and I lend to the rich—FAKEER.But how many nails do you run in your breech?INDIAN.With submission I speak to your rev'rence's tail;But mine has no taste for a tenpenny nail.FAKEER.Well! I'll pray to our prophet, and get you preferr'd;Though no farther expect than to heaven the third.With me in the thirtieth your seat to obtain,You must qualify duly with hunger and pain.INDIAN.With you in the thirtieth! you impudent rogue!Can such wretches as you give to madness a vogue!Though the priesthood of FO on the vulgar impose,By squinting whole years at the end of their nose,Though with cruel devices of mortificationThey adore a vain idol of modern creation,Does the God of the heav'ns such a service direct?Can his mercy approve a self-punishing sect?Will his wisdom be worship'd with chains and with nails?Or e'er look for his rites in your noses and tails?Come along to my house, and these penances leave,Give your belly a feast, and your breech a reprieve.This reasoning unhing'd each fanatical notion;And stagger'd our saint in his chair of promotion.At length with reluctance he rose from his seat;And resigning his nails and his fame for retreat,Two weeks his new life he admir'd and enjoy'd:The third he with plenty and quiet was cloy'd.To live undistinguish'd to him was the pain,An existence unnotic'd he could not sustain.In retirement he sigh'd for the fame-giving chair,For the crowd to admire him, to rev'rence and stare:No endearments of pleasure and ease could prevail;He the saintship resum'd, and new larded his tail.Our FAKEER represents all the vot'ries of fame;Their ideas, their means, and their end is the same:The sportsman, the buck; all the heroes of vice,With their gallantry, lewdness, the bottle and dice;The poets, the critics, the metaphysicians,The courtier, the patriot, all politicians;The statesman begirt with th' importunate ring,(I had almost compleated my list with the king);All labour alike to illustrate my tale;All tortur'd by choice with th' invisible nail.To Mr. WHITEHEAD, On his being made POET LAUREAT. 1757.BY THE SAME.'TIS so—though we're surpris'd to hear it:The laurel is bestow'd on merit.How hush'd is every envious voice!Confounded by so just a choice,Though by prescriptive right prepar'dTo libel the selected bard.But as you see the statesman's fateIn this our democratic state,Whom virtue strives in vain to guardFrom the rude pamphlet and the card;You'll find the demagogues of PindusIn envy not a jot behind us:For each Aonian politician(Whose element is opposition),Will shew how greatly they surpass usIn gall and wormwood at Parnassus.Thus as the same detracting spiritAttends on all distinguish'd merit,When 'tis your turn, observe, the quarrelIs not with you, but with the laurel.Suppose that laurel on your brow,For cypress chang'd, funereal bough!See all things take a diff'rent turn!The very critics sweetly mourn,And leave their satire's pois'nous stingIn plaintive elegies to sing:With solemn threnody and dirgeConduct you to Elysium's verge.At Westminster the surplic'd deanThe sad but honourable scenePrepares. The well-attended herseBears you amid the kings of verse.Each rite observ'd, each duty paid,Your fame on marble is display'd,With symbols which your genius suit,The mask, the buskin, and the flute;The laurel crown aloft is hung;And o'er the sculptur'd lyre unstrungSad allegoric figures leaning—(How folks will gape to find their meaning!)And a long epitaph is spread,Which happy You will never read.But hold—The change is so invitingI own, I tremble while I'm writing.Yet, WHITEHEAD, 'tis too soon to lose you:Let critics flatter or abuse you,O! teach us, ere you change the sceneTo Stygian banks from Hippocrene,How free-born bards should strike the strings,And how a Briton write to kings.VERSES on the Prospect of planting ARTS and LEARNING in AMERICA.BY Dr. BERKELEY, Bishop of CLOYNEWritten about the year 1728, when the author had in view the scheme of founding a college at Bermudas, which failed of success in the attempt..THE Muse, disgusted at an age and clime,Barren of every glorious theme,In distant lands now waits a better time,Producing subjects worthy fame:In happy climes, where from the genial sunAnd virgin earth such scenes ensue,The force of art by nature seems outdone,And fancied beauties by the true:In happy climes, the seat of innocence,Where nature guides and virtue rules,Where men shall not impose for truth and senseThe pedantry of courts and schools:There shall be sung another golden age,The rise of empire and of arts,The good and great inspiring epic rage,The wisest heads, and noblest hearts.Not such as Europe breeds in her decay;Such as she bred when fresh and young,When heav'nly flame did animate her clay,By future poets shall be sung.Westward the course of empire takes its way;The four first acts already past,A fifth shall close the drama with the day;Time's noblest offspring is the last.To Mr. MASON.By WILLIAM WHITEHEAD, EsqI.BELIEVE me, MASON, 'tis in vainThy fortitude the torrent braves;Thou too must bear th' inglorious chain;The world, the world will have its slaves.The chosen friend, for converse sweet,The small, yet elegant retreat,Are peaceful unambitious viewsWhich early fancy loves to form,When, aided by the ingenuous Muse,She turns the philosophic page,And sees the wise of every ageWith Nature's dictates warm.II.But ah! to few has Fortune givenThe choice, to take or to refuse;To fewer still indulgent HeavenAllots the very will to chuse.And why are varying schemes preferr'd?Man mixes with the common herd,By custom guided to pursueOr wealth, or honors, fame, or ease;What others wish he wishes too,Nor, from his own peculiar choice,'Till strengthen'd by the public voice,His very pleasures please.III.How oft, beneath some hoary shadeWhere Cam glides indolently slow,Hast thou, as indolently laid,Preferr'd to Heav'n thy fav'rite vow;"Here, here for ever let me stay,"Here calmly loiter life away,"Nor all those vain connections know"Which fetter down the free-born mind"The slave of interest, or of shew;"Whilst yon gay tenant of the grove,"The happier heir of Nature's love,"Can warble unconfin'd."IV.Yet sure, my friend, th' eternal planBy Truth unerring was design'd;Inferior parts were made for man,But man himself for all mankind.Then by th' apparent judge th' unseen;Behold how rolls this vast machineTo one great end, howe'er withstood,Directing its impartial course,All labour for the general good.Some stem the wave, some till the soil,By choice the bold, th' ambitious toil,The indolent by force.V.That bird, thy fancy frees from care,With many a fear unknown to thee,Must rove to glean his scanty fareFrom field to field, from tree to tree:His lot, united with his kind,Has all his little joys confin'd;The Lover's and the Parent's tiesAlarm by turns his anxious breast;Yet, bound by fate, by instinct wise,He hails with songs the rising morn,And pleas'd at evening's cool returnHe sings himself to rest.VI.And tell me, has not Nature madeSome stated void for thee to fill,Some spring, some wheel, which asks thy aidTo move, regardless of thy will?Go then, go feel with glad surpriseNew bliss from new connections rise;'Till, happier in thy wider sphere,Thou quit thy darling schemes of ease;Nay, glowing in the full careerEv'n wish thy virtuous labours more;Nor 'till the toilsome day is o'erExpect the night of peace.ODE. To INDEPENDENCY.By Mr. MASON.I.HERE, on my native shore reclin'd,While Silence rules the midnight hour,I woo thee, GODDESS. On my musing mindDescend, propitious Power!And bid these ruffling gales of grief subside:Bid my calm'd soul with all thy influence shine;As yon chaste Orb along this ample tideDraws the long lustre of her silver line,While the hush'd breeze its last weak whisper blows,And lulls old HUMBER to his deep repose.II.Come to thy Vot'ry's ardent prayer,In all thy graceful plainness drest;No knot confines thy waving hair,No zone thy floating vest.Unsullied Honor decks thine open brow;And Candor brightens in thy modest eye:Thy blush is warm Content's aetherial glow,Thy smile is Peace; thy step is Liberty:Thou scatter'st blessings round with lavish hand,As Spring with careless fragrance fills the land.III.As now o'er this lone beach I stray;Thy Andrew Marvell, born at Kingston upon Hull in the year 1620. fav'rite Swain oft stole along,And artless wove his Doric lay,Far from the busy throng.Thou heard'st him, Goddess, strike the tender string,And bad'st his soul with bolder passions move:Strait these responsive shores forgot to ringWith Beauty's praise, or plaint of slighted Love:To loftier flights his daring Genius rose,And led the war 'gainst thine and Freedom's foes.IV.Pointed with Satire's keenest steel,The shafts of Wit he darts around:Ev'n Parker, bishop of Oxford. mitred Dulness learns to feel,And shrinks beneath the wound.In awful poverty his honest MuseWalks forth vindictive through a venal land:In vain Corruption sheds her golden dews,In vain Oppression lifts her iron hand:He scorns them both, and, arm'd with truth alone,Bids Lust and Folly tremble on the throne.V.Behold, like him, immortal Maid,The Muses vestal fires I bring:Here at thy feet the sparks I spread;Propitious wave thy wing,And fan them to that dazzling blaze of Song,That glares tremendous on the Sons of Pride.But, hark, methinks I hear her hallow'd tongue!In distant trills it echoes o'er the tide;Now meets mine ear with warbles wildly free,As swells the lark's meridian ecstacy.VI."Fond Youth! to MARVELL'S patriot fame,"Thy humble breast must ne'er aspire."Yet nourish still the lambent flame;"Still strike thy blameless lyre;"Led by the moral Muse securely rove;"And all the vernal sweets thy vacant Youth"Can cull from busy Fancy's fairy grove,"O hang their foliage round the fane of Truth:"To arts like these devote thy tuneful toil,"And meet its fair reward in D'ARCY'S smile."VII."'Tis he, my Son, alone shall cheer"Thy sick'ning soul; at that sad hour."When o'er a much-lov'd Parent's bier"Thy duteous Sorrows shower:"At that sad hour, when all thy hopes decline;"When pining Care leads on her pallid train,"And sees thee, like the weak and widow'd Vine,"Winding thy blasted tendrils o'er the plain."At that sad hour shall D'ARCY lend his aid,"And raise with Friendship's arm thy drooping head.VIII."This fragrant wreath, the Muses meed,"That bloom'd those vocal shades among,"Where never Flatt'ry dared to tread,"Or Interest's servile throng;"Receive, my favour'd Son, at my command,"And keep, with sacred care, for D'ARCY'S brow"Tell him, twas wove by my immortal hand,"I breath'd on every flower a purer glow;"Say, for thy sake, I send the gift divine"To him, who calls thee HIS, yet makes thee MINE."ODE. On MELANCHOLY. To a FRIEND.BY THE SAME.I.AH! cease this kind persuasive strain,Which, when it flows from friendship's tongue.However weak, however vain,O'erpowers beyond the Siren's song:Leave me, my friend, indulgent go,And let me muse upon my woe.Why lure me from these pale retreats?Why rob me of these pensive sweets?Can Music's voice, can Beauty's eye,Can Painting's glowing hand, supplyA charm so suited to my mind,As blows this hollow gust of wind,As drops this little weeping rillSoft-tinkling down the moss-grown hill,Whilst through the west, where sinks the crimson Day,Meek Twilight slowly sails, and waves her banners grey?II.Say, from Affliction's various sourceDo none but turbid waters flow?And cannot Fancy clear their course?For Fancy is the friend of Woe.Say, 'mid that grove, in love-lorn state,When yon poor Ringdove mourns her mate,Is all, that meets the shepherd's ear,Inspir'd by anguish, and despair?Ah no, fair Fancy rules the song:She swells her throat; she guides her tongue;She bids the waving Aspin sprayQuiver in cadence to her lay;She bids the fringed Osiers bow,And rustle round the lake below,To suit the tenor of her gurgling sighs,And sooth her throbbing breast with solemn sympathies.III.To thee, whose young and polish'd browThe wrinkling hand of Sorrow spares;Whose cheeks, bestrew'd with roses, knowNo channel for the tide of tears;To thee yon Abbey, dank and lone,Where Ivy chains each mould'ring stoneThat nods o'er many a Martyr's tomb,May cast a formidable gloom.Yet some there are, who, free from fear,Could wander through the cloysters drear,Could rove each desolated Isle,Though midnight thunders shook the pile;And dauntless view, or seem to view,(As faintly flash the lightnings blue)Thin shiv'ring Ghosts from yawning charnels throng,And glance with silent sweep the shaggy vaults along.IV.But such terrific charms as these,I ask not yet: My sober mindThe fainter forms of Sadness please;My sorrows are of softer kind.Through this still valley let me stray,Wrapt in some strain of pensive GRAY:Whose lofty Genius bears alongThe conscious dignity of Song;And, scorning from the sacred storeTo waste a note on Pride, or Power,Roves, when the glimmering twilight glooms,And warbles 'mid the rustic tombs:He too perchance (for well I know,His heart would melt with friendly woe)He too perchance, when these poor limbs are laid,Will heave one tuneful sigh, and sooth my hov'ring shade.ODE.By Mr. GRAY.—

VARIATION.
In Mr. Gray's manuscript it originally stood,Awake, my lyre: my glory wake.M.,And give to rapture all thy trembling strings.From Helicon's harmonious springsThe subject and simile, as usual with Pindar, are united. The various sources of poetry, which gives life and lustre to all it touches, are here described; its quiet majestic progress enriching every subject (otherwise dry and barren) with a pomp of diction and luxuriant harmony of numbers; and its more rapid and irresistible course, when swoln and hurried away by the conflict of tumultuous passions. G.A thousand rills their mazy progress take:The laughing flowers, that round them blow,Drink life and fragrance as they flow.Now the rich stream of music winds alongDeep, majestic, smooth and strong,Through verdant vales, and Ceres' golden reign:Now rolling down the steep amain,Headlong, impetuous, see it pour:The rocks and nodding groves rebellow to the roar.I. 2.Oh!

The rest are loaded with unnecessary epithets, and would better suit the tamers tones of elegy.

G.Glance their many-twinkling feet.Slow This and the five following lines which follow are sweetly introduced by the short and unequal measures that precede them: the whole stanza is indeed a masterpiece of rhythm, and charms the ear by its well-varied cadence, as much as the imagery which it contains ravishes the fancy. There is (says our author in one of his manuscript papers) a toute ensemble of sound, as well as of sense, in poetical composition, always necessary to its perfection. What is gone before still dwells upon the ear, and insensibly harmonizes with the present line, as in that succession of fleeting notes which is called melody. Nothing "can better exemplify the truth of this fine observation than his own poetry.

The Earl of Surrey and Sir Thomas Wyatt had travelled in Italy, and formed their taste there; Spenser imitated the Italian writers; Milton improved on them: but this school expired soon after the Restoration, and a new one arose on the French model, which has subsisted ever since. G.Woods, that wave o'er Delphi's steep,Isles, that crown the Egaean deep,Fields, that cool Illissus laves,Or where Maeander's amber wavesIn lingering Lab'rinths creep,How do your tuneful Echo's languish,Mute, but to the voice of Anguish!Where each old poetic MountainInspiration breath'd around;Every shade and hallow'd FountainMurmur'd deep a solemn sound:'Till the sad Nine in Greece's evil hourLeft their Parnassus for the Latian plains.Alike they scorn the pomp of tyrant-Power,And coward Vice, that revels in her chains.When Latium had her lofty spirit lost,They sought, oh Albion! next thy sea-encircled coast.III. 1.An ingenious person, who sent Mr. Gray his remarks anonymously on this and the following ode soon after they were published, gives this stanza and the following a very just and well-expressed eulogy: A poet is perhaps never more conciliating than when he praises favourite predecessors in his art. Milton is not more the pride than Shakspeare the love of their country: it is therefore equally judicious to diffuse a tenderness and a grace through the praise of Shakspeare, as to extol in a strain more elevated and sonorous the boundless soarings of Milton's epic imagination. The critic has here well noted the beauty of contrast which results from the two descriptions; yet it is further to be observed, to the honor of our poet's judgment, that the tenderness and grace in the former does not prevent it from strongly characterizing the three capital persections of Shakspeare's genius; and when he describes his power of exciting terror (a species of the sublime he ceases to be diffuse, and becomes, as he ought to be, concise and energetical. M.Far from the sun and summer-gale,In thy green lap was Nature's Darling Shakspeare. G. laid,What time, where lucid Avon stray'd,To Him the mighty mother did unveilHer aweful face: The dauntless ChildStretch'd forth his little arms, and smil'd.This pencil take (she said) whose colours dearRichly paint the vernal year:Thine too these golden keys, immortal Boy!This can unlock the gates of Joy;Or Horrour that, and thrilling Fears,Or ope the sacred source of sympathetic Tears.III. 2.Nor second HeMilton.

. Homer Od. G.This has been condemned as a false thought, and more worthy of an Italian poet than of Mr. Gray. Count Algarotti, we have found in his letter to Mr. How, praises it highly; but as he was an Italian critic, his judgment, in this point, will not, perhaps by many, be thought to overbalance the objection. The truth is, that this fiction of the cause of Milton's blindness is not beyond the bounds of poetical credibility, any more than the fiction which precedes it concerning the birth of Shakspeare; and therefore would be equally admissible, had it not the peculiar misfortune to encounter a fact too well known: on this account the judgment revolts against it. Milton himself has told us, in a strain of heart-felt exultation, (see his Sonnet to Cyriac Skynner) that he lost his eye-sight, —overply'dIN LIBERTY'S DEFENCE, his noble task;Whereof all Europe rings from side to side;And, when we know this to have been the true cause, we cannot admit a fictitious one, however sublimely conceived, or happily expressed. If therefore so lofty and unrivalled a description will not atone for this acknowledged defect, in relation to matter of fact, all that the impartial critic can do, is to point out the reason, and to apologize for the poet, who was necessitated by his subject to consider Milton only in his poetical capacity.Since the above note was published, Mr. Brand, of East-Dearham, in Norfolk, has favoured me with a letter, in which he informs me of a very similar hyperbole extant in a MS. commentary upon Plato's Phaedon, written by Hermias, a christian philosopher, of the second century, and which is printed in Bayle's Dictionary (Art. Achilles.) It contains the following anecdote of Homer:—That keeping some sheep near the tomb of Achilles, he obtained, by his offerings and supplications, a sight of that hero; who appeared to him surrounded with so much glory that Homer could not bear the splendor of it, and that he was not only dazzled, but blinded by the sight. The ingenious gentleman makes no doubt but Mr. Gray took his thought from this passage, and applauds him for the manner in which he has improved upon it: he also thinks in general that a deviation from historical truth, though it may cast a shade over the middling beauties of poetry, produces no bad effect where the magnificence and brilliancy of the images entirely fill the imagination; and with regard to this passage in prticular, he intimates, that as the cause of Milton's blindness is not so well known as the thing itself, the licence of poetical invention may allow him to assign a cause different from the real fact. However this may be, the very exact resemblance, which the two thoughts bear to one another, will, I hope, vindicate Mr. Gray's from being a modern concetto in the taste of the Italian school, as it has been deemed to be by some critics. But this resemblance will do more (and it is on this account chiefly that I produce, and thank the gentleman for communicating it); it will prove the extreme uncertainty of decding upon poetical imitations; for I am fully persuaded that Mr. Gray had never seen, or at least attended to, this Greek fragment. How scrupulus he was in borrowing even an epithet from another poet, many of his notes on this very ode fully prove. And as to the passage in question, he would certainly have cited it, for the sake of vindicating his own taste by classical authority, especially when the thought had been so much controverted.Closed his eyes in endless night.Behold, where Dryden's less presumptuous carWide o'er the fields of glory bearTwo coursers of etherial race,IMITATION.

Words that weep, and tears that speak. Cowley.Thoughts, that breathe, and words, that burnWe have had in our language no other odes of the sublime kind than that of Dryden on St. Cecilia's Day: for Cowley (who had his merit) yet wanted judgment, style, and harmony for such a task. That of Pope is not worthy of so great a man. Mr. Mason indeed of late days has touched the true chords, and with a masterly hand, in some of his choruses—above all in the last of Caractacus.Hark! heard ye not yon footstep dread! G.But ah! 'tis heard no more—Oh! Lyre divine, what daring SpiritWakes thee now? though he inheritNor the pride, nor ample pinion,.

The irresistible violence of the prophet's passions bears him away, who, as he is unprepared by a formal ushering in of the speaker, is unfortified against the impressions of his poetical phrenzy, and overpowered by them, as sudden thunders strike the deepest. All readers of taste, I fancy, have felt this effect from the passage; they will be well pleased however to see their own feelings so well expressed as they are in this note.RUIN seize thee, ruthless King!'Confusion on thy banners wait,'Though fann'd by Conquest's crimson wing'IMITATION.

R. Hygden, speaking of the Castle of Conway, built by king Edward the first, says, "Ad ortum amnis Conway ad clivum montis Erery;" and Matthew of Westminster (ad ann. 1283) Apud Aberconway ad pedes montis Snowdoniae fecit erigi castrum forte.

G.Mr. Gray never saw the large Cartoon, done by the same divine hand, in the possession of the Duke of Montagu, at his seat at Boughton in Northamptonshire, else I am persuaded he would have mentioned it in his note. The two finished pictures abroad (which I believe are closet-pieces) can hardly have so much spirit in them as this wonderful drawing; it gave me the sublimest idea I ever received from painting. Moses breaking the tables of the law, by Parmegiano, was a figure which Mr. Gray used to say came still nearer to his meaning than the picture of Raphael.

At this day (I am told) the highest point of Snowdon is called the eagle's nest. That bird is certainly no stranger to this island, as the Scots, and the people of Cumberland, Westmoreland, &c. can testify: it even has built its nest in the Peak of Derbyshire.

In the rest of this stanza the wildness of thought, expression, and cadence, are admirably adapted to the character and situation of the speaker, and of the bloody spectres his assistants. It is not indeed peculiar to it alone, but a beauty that runs throughout the whole composition, that the historical events are briefly sketched out by a few striking circumstances, in which the poet's office of rather exciting and directing, than satisfying the reader's imagination, is perfectly observed. Such abrupt hints, resembling the several fragments of a vast ruin, suffer not the mind to be raised to the utmost pitch, by one image of horror, but that instantaneously a second and a third are presented to it, and the affection is still uniformly supported.

See Froissart and other contemporary writers. It is always entertaining, and sometimes useful, to be informed how a writer frequently improves on his original thoughts; on this account I have occasionally set down the few variations which Mr. Gray made in his lyrical composition. The six lines before us convey, perhaps, the most beautiful piece of imagery in the whole Ode, and were a wonderful improvement on those which he first wrote; which, though they would appear fine in an inferior poet, are infinitely below those which supplanted them. I find them in one of his corrected manuscripts as follow: VARIATION. Mirrors of Saxon truth and loyalty,Your helpless old expiring Master view!They hear not: scarce Religion dares supplyHer mutter'd Requiems, and her holy dew.Yet thou, proud boy, from Pomfret's walls shall sendA sigh, and envy oft thy happy grandfire's end.M.Fair laughs the Morn, and soft the Zephyr blows,"While proudly riding o'er the azure realm"In gallant trim the gilded Vessel goes;"Youth on the prow, and Pleasure at the helm;"Regardless of the sweeping Whirlwind's sway,"That, hush'd in trim repose, expects his evening-prey.II. 3."Richard the Second (as we are told by Archbishop Scroop, Thomas of Walsingham, and all the older Writers) was starved to death. The story of his assassination, by Sir Piers of Exon, is of much later date. G.This stanza (as an ingenious friend remarks) has exceeding merit. It breathes in a lesser compass, what the Ode breathes at large, the high spirit of lyric Enthusiasm. The Transitions are sudden, and imperuous; the language full of fire and force; and the Imagery carried, without impropriety, to the most daring height. The manner of Richard's death by famine exhibits such beauties of Personification, as only the richest and most vivid imagination could supply. From thence we are hurried, with the wildest rapidity, into the midst of battle; and the epithet kindred places at once before our eyes all the peculiar horrors of civil war. Immediately, by a transition most striking and unexpected, the Poet falls into a tender and pathetic address; which, from the sentiments and also from the numbers, has all the melancholy flow, and breathes all the plaintive softness, of Elegy. Again the Scene changes; again the Bard rises into an allegorical description of Carnage, to which the metre is admirably adapted: and the concluding sentence of personal punishment on Edward is denounced with a solemnity, that chills and terrifies.

From the loose and fugitive pieces, some printed, others in manuscript, which for forty or fifty years past have been thrown into the world, and carelessly left to perish; I have here, according to the most judicious opinions I could obtain in distinguishing their merits, endeavour'd to select and preserve the best. The favourable reception which the former volumes have met with, demands my warmest acknowledgments, and calls for all my care in compleating the Collection; and in this respect, if it appear that I have not been altogether negligent, I shall hope to be allowed the merit, which is all I claim, of having furnished to the Public an elegant and polite Amusement. Little more need be added, than to return my thanks to several ingenious friends, who have obligingly contributed to this Entertainment. If the reader should happen to find, what I hope he seldom will, any pieces which he may think unworthy of having been inserte; as it would ill become me to attribute his dislike of them to his own want of Taste, so I am too conscious of my own deficiencies not to allow him to impute the insertion of them to mine.R.
