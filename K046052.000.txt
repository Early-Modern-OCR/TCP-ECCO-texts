Act IV. TANCRED and SIGISMUNDA, Sce. II.MR. GARRICK in the Character of TANCRED.—Earl Osmond's WifeHeavens! did I hear thee right? what! marry'd? marry'd!Lost to thy faithful Tancred! lost for ever!Tancred and Sigismunda. A TRAGEDY. As it is Acted at the THEATRE-ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE, By His MAJESTY'S Servants.By JAMES THOMSON.LONDON: Printed for A. MILLAR, opposite Katharine-street in the Strand. M.DCC.XLV. (Price One Shilling and Six-pence.)TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS FREDERICK, PRINCE of WALES.SIR,THE Honour YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS has done me in the Protection you was pleased to give to this Tragedy, emboldens me to lay it now at your Feet, and beg your Permission to publish it under your Royal Patronage. The Favouring and Protecting of Letters has been, in all Ages and Countries, one distinguishing Mark of a great Prince; and That with good reason, not only as it shews a Justness of Taste, and Elevation of Mind, but as

the Influence of such a Protection, by exciting good Writers to labour with more Emulation in the Improvement of their several Talents, not a little contributes to the Embellishment, and Instruction of Society. But of all the different Species of Writing, none has such an Effect upon the Lives and Manners of Men, as the Dramatick; and therefore That of all others most deserves the Attention of Princes, who by a judicious Approbation of such Pieces as tend to promote all Publick and Private Virtue, may more than by any coercive Methods secure the Purity of the Stage, and in consequence thereof greatly advance the Morals and Politeness of their People. How eminently YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS has always extended your Favour and Patronage to every Art and Science, and in a particular Manner to Dramatick Performances, is too well known to the World for me to mention it here. Allow me only to wish, that what I have now the Honour to offer your

ROYAL HIGHNESS may be judged not unworthy of your Protection, at least in the Sentiments which it inculcates. A warm and grateful Sense of your Goodness to me makes me desirous to seize every Occasion of declaring in Publick, with what profound Respect and dutiful Attachment, I am,SIR,Your ROYAL HIGHNESS'S Most obliged, Most obedient, and Most devoted Servant, James Thomson.ADVERTISEMENT.THIS Play is considerably shortened in the Performance; but I hope it will not be disagreeable to the Reader to see it as it was at first written; there being a great Difference betwixt a Play in the Closet, and upon the Stage.Printed for A. MILLAR, in the Strand.I. A NEW Edition of all Mr. THOMSON'S Works, carefully corrected; with the Addition of above One Thousand New Lines. In Two Volumes, Octavo, on good Paper, and a large Letter; containing his SEASONS, all his other Poems, and his Three Tragedies. Price bound Ten Shillings.II. His SEASONS, printed in a Pocket Volume. Price bound Three Shillings.PROLOGUE.BOLD is the Man! who, in this nicer Age,Presumes to tread the chaste corrected Stage.Now, with gay tinsel Arts, we can no moreConceal the Want of Nature's sterling Ore.Our Spells are vanish'd, broke our magic Wand,That us'd to waft you over Sea and Land.Before your Light the fairy People fade,The Demons fly—The Ghost itself is laid.In vain of martial Scenes the loud Alarms,The mighty Prompter thundering out to Arms,The Playhouse Posse clattering from afar,The close-wedg'd Battle, and the Din of War.Now, even the Senate seldom we convene;The yawning Fathers nod behind the Scene.Your Taste rejects the glittering false Sublime,To sigh in Metaphor, and die in Rhime.High Rant is tumbled from his Gallery Throne:Description, Dreams—nay Similies are gone.What shall we then? to please you how devise?Whose Judgment sits not in your Ears and Eyes.Thrice happy! could we catch great SHAKESPEAR's Art,To trace the deep Recesses of the Heart;His simple plain Sublime, to which is givenTo strike the Soul with darted Flame from Heaven:Could we awake soft OTWAY's tender Woe,The Pomp of Verse and golden Lines of ROWE.We to your Hearts apply: let them attend;Before their silent candid Bar we bend.If warm'd they listen, 'tis our noblest Praise;If cold, they wither all the Muse's Bays.The Persons Represented.TANCRED, Count of Lecce,By Mr. Garrick.MATTEO SIFFREDI, Lord High Chancellor of Sicily,By Mr. Sheridan.Earl OSMOND, Lord High Constable of Sicily,By Mr. Delane.RODOLPHO, Friend to TANCRED, and Captain of the Guards,By Mr. Havard.SIGISMUNDA, Daughter of SIFFREDI,By Mrs. Cibber.LAURA, Sister of RODOLPHO, and Friend to SIGISMUNDA,By Miss Budgell.BARONS, OFFICERS, GUARDS, &c. SCENE, The City of Palermo in Sicily.Tancred and Sigismunda.A TRAGEDY.ACT I. SCENE I.SIGISMUNDA, LAURA.SIGISMUNDA.AH fatal Day to Sicily! The KingThen touches his last Moments?LAURA.So 'tis fear'd.SIGISMUNDA.The Death of those distinguish'd by their Station,But by their Virtue more, awakes the MindTo solemn Dread, and strikes a saddening Awe:Not that we grieve for them, but for ourselves,Left to the Toil of Life—And yet the BestAre, by the playful Children of this World,At once forgot, as they had never been.LAURA, 'tis said—the Heart is sometimes charg'dWith a prophetick Sadness: Such, methinks,
Now hangs on mine. The King's approaching DeathSuggests a thousand Fears. What Troubles thenceMay throw the State once more into Confusion,What sudden Changes in my Father's HouseMay rise, and part me from my dearest TANCRED,Alarms my Thought.LAURA.The Fears of Love-sick Fancy!Perversely busy to torment it self.But be assur'd, your Father's steady Friendship,Join'd to a certain Genius, that commands,Not kneels to Fortune will support and cherish,Here in the publick Eye of Sicily,This—I may call him—his adopted Son,The noble TANCRED, form'd to all his Virtues.SIGISMUNDA.Ah form'd to charm his Daughter!—This fair MornHas tempted far the Chace. Is he not yetReturn'd?LAURA.No.—When your Father to the King,Who now expiring lies, was call'd in haste,He sent each way his Messengers to find him;With such a Look of Ardor and Impatience,As if this near Event was to Count TANCREDOf more Importance than I comprehend.SIGISMUNDA.There lies, my LAURA, o'er my TANCRED'S BirthA Cloud I cannot pierce. With princely Cost,Nay, with Respect, which oft I have observ'd,Stealing at times submissive o'er his Features,In Belmont's Woods my Father rear'd this Youth—Ah Woods! where first my artless Bosom learntThe Sighs of Love.—He gives him out the SonOf an old Friend, a Baron of Apulia,Who in the late Crusado b avely fell.But then 'tis strange; is all his Family
As well as Father dead? and all their Friends,Except my Sire, the generous good SIFFREDI?Had he a Mother, Sister, Brother left,The last Remain of Kindred, with what Pride,What Rapture, might they fly o'er Earth and Sea,To claim this rising Honour of their Blood!This bright Unknown! this all-accomplish'd Youth!Who charms—too much—the Heart of SIGISMUNDA!LAURA, perhaps your Brother knows him better,The Friend and Partner of his freest Hours.What says RODOLPHO? Does he truely creditThis Story of his Birth?LAURA.He has sometimes,Like you, his Doubts; yet, when maturely weigh'd,Believes it true. As for Lord TANCRED'S Self,He never entertain'd the slightest ThoughtThat verg'd to Doubt; but oft laments his State,By cruel Fortune so ill-pair'd to yours.SIGISMUNDA.Merit like his, the Fortune of the Mind,Beggars all Wealth—Then to your Brother, LAURA,He talks of me?LAURA.Of nothing else. Howe'erThe Talk begin, it ends with SIGISMUNDA.Their Morning, Noon-tide, and their Evening WalksAre full of you; and all the Woods of BelmontInamour'd with your Name—SIGISMUNDA.Away, my Friend;You flatter—yet the dear Delusion charms.LAURA.No, SIGISMUNDA, 'tis the strictest Truth,
Nor half the Truth, I tell you. Even with FondnessMy Brother talks for ever of the Passion,That fires young TANCRED'S Breast. So much it strikes him,He praises Love as if he were a Lover.He blames the false Pursuits of vagrant Youth,Calls them gay Folly, a mistaken StruggleAgainst best-judging Nature. Heaven, he says,In lavish Bounty form'd the Heart for Love;In Love included all the finer SeedsOf Honour, Virtue, Friendship, purest Bliss—SIGISMUNDA.Virtuous RODOLPHO!LAURA.Then his pleasing ThemeHe varies to the Praises of your Lover—SIGISMUNDA.And what, my LAURA, says he on that Subject?LAURA.He says that, tho' he were not nobly born,Nature has form'd him noble, generous, brave,Truely magnanimous, and warmly scorningWhatever bears the smallest Taint of Baseness:That every easy Virtue is his own;Not learnt by painful Labour, but inspir'd,Implanted in his Soul—Chiefly one CharmHe in his graceful Character observes:That tho' his Passions burn with high Impatience,And sometimes, from a noble Heat of Nature,Are ready to fly off, yet the least CheckOf ruling Reason brings them back to Temper,And gentle Softness.SIGISMUNDA.True! O true, RODOLPHO!Blest be thy kindred Worth for loving his!He is all Warmth, all amiable Fire,All quick Heroic Ardor! temper'd soft
With Gentleness of Heart, and manly Reason!If Virtue were to wear a human Form,To light it with her Dignity and Flame,Then softening mix her Smiles and tender Graces,O she would chuse the Person of my TANCRED!Go on, my Friend, go on, and ever praise him;The Subject knows no Bounds, nor can I tire,While my Breast trembles to that sweetest Musick!The Heart of Woman tastes no truer Joy,Is never flatter'd with such dear Enchantment—'Tis more than selfish Vanity—as whenShe hears the Praises of the Man she loves—LAURA.Madam, your Father comes.SCENE II.SIFFREDI, SIGISMUNDA, LAURA.SIFFREDI.[To an Attendant as he enters.Lord TANCRED thenIs found?ATTENDANT.My Lord, he quickly will be here.I scarce could keep before him, tho' he bid meSpeed on, to say he would attend your Orders.SIFFREDI.'Tis well—retire—You, too, my Daughter, leave me.SIGISMUNDA.I go, my Father—But how fAres the King?SIFFREDI.He is no more. Gone to that awful State,Where Kings the Crown wear only of their Virtues.SIGISMUNDA.How bright must then be his!—This Stroke is sudden.He was this Morning well, when to the ChaceLord TANCRED went.SIFFREDI.'Tis true. But at his YearsDeath gives short Notice—Dropping Nature then,Without a Gust of Pain to shake it, falls.His Death, my Daughter, was that happy PeriodWhich few attain. The Duties of his DayWere all discharg'd, and gratefully enjoy'dIt's noblest Blessings; calm, as Evening Skies,Was his pure Mind, and lighted up with HopesThat open Heaven; when, for his last long SleepTimely prepar'd, a Lassitude of Life,A pleasing Weariness of mortal Joy,Fell on his Soul, and down he sunk to Rest.O may my Death be such!—He but one WishLeft unfulfill'd, which was to see Count TANCRED—SIGISMUNDA.To see Count TANCRED!—Pardon me, my Lord—SIFFREDI.For what, my Daughter?—But, with such Emotion.Why did you start at Mention of Count TANCRED?SIGISMUNDA.Nothing—I only hop'd the dying KingMight mean to make some generous just ProvisionFor this your worthy Charge, this noble Orphan.SIFFREDI.And he has done it largely—Leave me now—I want some private Conference with Lord TANCRED.SCENE III.SIFFREDI alone.My Doubts are but too true—If these old EyesCan trace the Marks of Love, a mutual PassionHas seiz'd, I fear, my Daughter and this Prince,My Sovereign now—Should it be so? Ah there,There lurks a brooding Tempest, that may shakeMy long-concerted Scheme, to settle firmThe publick Peace and Welfare, which the KingHas made the prudent Basis of his Will—Away! unworthy Views! you shall not tempt me!Nor Interest nor Ambition shall seduceMy fixt Resolve—perish the selfish Thought,Which our own Good prefers to that of Millions!—He comes—my King—unconscious of his Fortune.SCENE IV.TANCRED. SIFFREDI.TANCRED.My Lord SIFFREDI, in your Looks I read,Confirm'd, the mournful News that fly abroadFrom Tongue to Tongue—We then, at last, have lostThe good old King?SIFFREDI.Yes, We have lost a Father!The greatest Blessing Heaven bestows on Mortals,And sEldom found amidst these Wilds of Time,A good, a woRthy King!—Hear me, my TANCRED,
And I will tell thee, in a few plain Words,How he deserv'd that best that glorious Title.'Tis nought complex, 'tis clear as Truth and Virtue.He lov'd his People, deem'd them all his Children;The Good exalted and depress'd the Bad.He spurn'd the flattering Crew, with Scorn rejectedTheir smooth Advice that only means themselves,Their Schemes to aggrandize him into Baseness:Nor did he less disdain the secret Breath,The whisper'd Tale, that blights a virtuous Name.He sought alone the Good of Those, for whomHe was entrusted with the sovereign Power:Well knowing that a People in their RightsAnd Industry protected; living safeBeneath the sacred Shelter of the Laws,Encourag'd in their Genius, Arts, and Labours,And happy each as he himself deserves,Are ne'er ungrateful. With unsparing HandThey will for Him provide: their filial LoveAnd Confidence are his unfailing Treasure,And every honest Man his faithful Guard.TANCRED.A general Face of Grief o'erspreads the City.I mark'd the People, as I hither came,In Crouds assembled, struck with silent Sorrow,And pouring forth the noblest Praise of Tears.Those whom Remembrance of their former Woes,And long Experience of the vain IllusionsOf youthful Hope, had into wise ContentAnd Fear of Change corrected, wrung their Hands,And often casting up their Eyes to HeavenGave sign of sad Conjecture. Others shew'd,Athwart their Grief, or real or affected,A Gleam of Expectation, from what ChanceAnd Change might bring. A mingled Murmur runAlong the Streets; and, from the lonely Court
Of him who can no more assist their Fortunes,I saw the Courtier-Fry, with eager haste,All hurrying to CONSTANTIA.SIFFREDI.Noble Youth!I joy to hear from Thee these just Reflexions,Worthy of riper Years—But if they seekCONSTANTIA, trust me, they mistake their Course.TANCRED.How! Is she not, my Lord, the late King's Sister,Heir to the Crown of Sicily? the lastOf our fam'd Norman Line, and now our Queen?SIFFREDI.TANCRED, 'tis true; she is the late King's Sister,The sole surviving Offspring of that TyrantWILLIAM the Bad—so for his Vices stil'd;Who spilt much noble Blood, and sore oppress'dTh' exhausted Land: whence grievous Wars arose,And many a dire Convulsion shook the State.When He, whose Death Sicilia mourns to-day,WILLIAM, who has and well deserv'd the NameOf Good, succeeding to his Father's Throne,Reliev'd his Country's Woes—But to return—She is the late King's Sister, born some MonthsAfter the Tyrant's Death, but not next Heir.TANCRED.You much surprize me—May I then presumeTo ask who is?SIFFREDI.Come nearer, noble TANCRED,Son of my Care! I must, on this occasion,Consult thy generous Heart; which, when conductedBy Rectitude of Mind and honest Virtues,Gives better Counsel than the hoary Head—Then know, there lives a Prince, here in Palermo,The lineal Offspring of our famous Heroe,ROGER the First.TANCRED.Great Heaven!—How far remov'dFrom that our mighty Founder?SIFFREDI.His great Grandson:Sprung from his eldest Son, who died untimely,Before his Father.TANCRED.Ha! the Prince you meanIs he not MANFRED'S Son? The generous, brave,Unhappy MANFRED! whom the Tyrant WILLIAM,You just now mention'd, not content to spoilOf his paternal Crown, threw into Fetters,And infamously murder'd.SIFFREDI.Yes—the same.TANCRED.By Heavens! I joy to find our Norman Reign,The Light of Earth amidst these barbarous Ages!Yet rears it's head; and shall not, from the Lance,Pass to the feeble Distaff—But this PrinceWhere has he lain conceal'd?SIFFREDI.The late good King,By noble Pity mov'd, contriv'd to save himFrom his dire Father's unrelenting Rage;And had him rear'd in private, as becameHis Birth and Hopes, with high and princely Nurture.Till now, too young to rule a troubled State,By Civil Broils most miserably torn,He in his safe Retreat has lain conceal'd,His Birth and Fortune to himself unknown;But when the dying King to me entrusted,As to the Chancellor of the Realm, his Will,His Successor he nam'd him.TANCRED.Happy Youth!He then will triumph o'er his Father's Foes,
O'er haughty OSMOND, and the Tyrant's Daughter.SIFFREDI.Ay, That is what I dread—that Heat of Youth;There lurks, I fear, Perdition to the State.I dread the Horrors of rekindled War:Tho' dead, the Tyrant still is to be fear'd;His Daughter's Party still is strong, and numerous:Her Friend, Earl OSMOND, Constable of Sicily,Experienc'd, brave, high-born, of mighty Interest.Better the Prince and Princess should by MarriageUnite their Friends, their Interest and their Claims:Then will the Peace and Welfare of the LandOn a firm Basis rise.TANCRED.My Lord SIFFREDI,If by myself I of this Prince may judge,That Scheme will scarce succeed—Your prudent AgeIn vain will counsel, if the Heart forbid it—But wherefore fear? The Right is clearly his;And, under your Direction, with each ManOf Worth, and stedfast Loyalty, to backAt once the King's Appointment and his Birthright,There is no ground for Fear. They have great Odds,Against the astonish'd Sons of Violence,Who fight with awful Justice on their Side.All Sicily will rouze, all faithful HeartsWill range themselves around Prince MANFRED'S Son.For me, I here devote me to the ServiceOf this young Prince; I every Drop of BloodWill lose with Joy, with Transport, in his Cause—Pardon my Warmth—but That, my Lord, will neverTo this Decision come—Then find the Prince;Lose not a Moment to awaken in himThe Royal Soul. Perhaps he now despondingPines in a Corner, and laments his Fortune;That in the narrow Bounds of private Life
He must confine his Aims, those swelling VirtuesWhich from his noble Father he inherits.SIFFREDI.Perhaps, regardless, in the common BaneOf Youth he melts in Vanity and Love.But if the Seeds of Virtue glow within him,I will awake a higher Sense, a LoveThat grasps the Loves and Happiness of Millions.TANCRED.Why that Surmise? Or should he love, SIFFREDI,I doubt not, it is nobly, which will raiseAnd animate his Virtues—O permit meTo plead the Cause of Youth—Their Virtue oft,In Pleasure's  Enchantment lull'd a while,Forgets itself; it sleeps and gayly dreams,Till great Occasion rouse it: Then, all Flame,It walks abroad, with heighten'd Soul and Vigour,And by the Change astonishes the World.Even with a kind of Sympathy, I feelThe Joy that waits this Prince; when all the Powers,Th' expanding Heart can wish, of doing good;Whatever swells Ambition, or exaltsThe human Soul into divine Emotions,All croud at once upon him.SIFFREDI.Ah, my TANCRED,Nothing so easy as in Speculation,And at a distance seen, the Course of Honour,A fair delightful Champian strew'd with Flowers.But when the Practice comes; when our fond Passions,Pleasure and Pride and Self-Indulgence throwTheir magic Dust around, the Prospect roughens:Then dreadful Passes, craggy Mountains rise,Cliffs to be scal'd, and Torrents to be stem'd:Then Toil ensues, and Perseverance stern;And endless Combats with our grosser Sense,Oft lost, and oft renew'd; and generous Pain
For others felt; and, harder Lesson still!Our honest Bliss for others sacrific'd;And all the rugged Task of Virtue quailsThe stoutest Heart of common Resolution.Few get above this turbid Scene of Strife,Few gain the Summit, breathe that purest Air,That heavenly Ether, which untroubled seesThe Storm of Vice and Passion rage below.TANCRED.Most true, my Lord. But why thus augure Ill?You seem to doubt this Prince. I know him not.Yet oh, methinks, my Heart could answer for him!The Juncture is so high, so strong the GaleThat blows from Heaven, as thro' the deadest SoulMight breathe the godlike Energy of Virtue.SIFFREDI.Hear him, immortal Shades of his great Fathers!—Forgive me, Sir, this Trial of your Heart:Thou! Thou art he!TANCRED.SIFFREDI!SIFFREDI.TANCRED, thou!Thou art the Man, of all the many Thousands,That toil upon the Bosom of this Isle,By Heaven elected to command the rest,To rule, protect them, and to make them happy!TANCRED.MANFRED my Father! I the last SupportOf the fam'd Norman Line, that awes the World!I! who this Morning wander'd forth an Orphan,Outcast of all but Thee, my second Father!Thus call'd to Glory! to the first great LotOf Human Kind!—O wonder-working HANDThat, in majestic Silence, sways at willThe mighty Movements of unbounded Nature;O grant me HEAVEN! the Virtues to sustainThis awful Burden of so many Heroes!
Let me not be exalted into Shame,Set up the worthless Pageant of vain Grandeur!Meantime I thank the Justice of the King,Who has my Right bequeath'd me. Thee, SIFFREDI,I thank Thee—O I ne'er enough can thank Thee!Yes, thou hast been—thou art—shalt be my Father!Thou shalt direct my unexperienc'd Years,Shalt be the ruling Head, and I the Hand.SIFFREDI.It is enough for me—to see my SovereignAssert his Virtues, and maintain his Honour.TANCRED.I think, my Lord, you said the King committedTo you his Will. I hope it is not clogg'dWith any base Conditions, any Clause,To tyrannize my Heart, and to CONSTANTIAEnslave my Hand devoted to another.The Hint you just now gave of that Alliance,You must imagine, wakes my Fear. But know,In this alone I will not bear Dispute,Not even from Thee, SIFFREDI!—Let the CouncilBe strait assembled, and the Will there open'd:Thence issue speedy Orders to convene,This Day ere Noon, the Senate: where those Barons,Who now are in Palermo, will attend,To pay their ready Homage to their King,Their rightful King, who claims his native Crown,And will not be a King of Deeds and Parchments.SIFFREDI.I go, my Liege. But once again permit meTo tell you—Now, now, is the trying Crisis,That must determine of your future Reign.O with Heroic Rigour watch your Heart!And to the sovereign Duties of the King,Th' unequal'd Pleasures of a God on Earth,Submit the common Joys, the common Passions,Nay, even the Virtues of the private Man.TANCRED.Of That no more. They not oppose, but aid,Invigorate, cherish, and reward each other.The kind all-ruling WISDOM is no Tyrant.SCENE V.TANCRED alone.Now, generous SIGISMUNDA, comes my Turn,To shew my Love was not of thine unworthy,When Fortune bade me blush to look to Thee.But what is Fortune to the Wish of Love?A miserable Bankrupt! O'tis poor,'Tis scanty all, whate'er we can bestow!The Wealth of Kings is Wretchedness and Want!—Quick, let me find Her! taste that highest Joy,Th' exalted Heart can know, the mixt EffusionOf Gratitude and Love!—Behold, She comes!SCENE VI.TANCRED. SIGISMUNDA.TANCRED.My fluttering Soul was all on Wing to find Thee,My Love! my SIGISMUNDA!SIGISMUNDA.O my TANCRED!Tell me, what means this Mystery and GloomThat lowrs around? Just now, involv'd in ThoughtMy Father shot athwart me—You, my Lord,Seem strangely mov'd—I fear some dark EventFrom the King's Death to trouble our Repose,That tender Calm we in the Woods of BelmontSo happily enjoy'd—Explain this Hurry,What means it? Say.TANCRED.It means that we are happy!Beyond our most romantic Wishes happy!SIGISMUNDA.You but perplex me more.TANCRED.It means, my Fairest!That thou art Queen of Sicily; and IThe happiest of Mankind! than Monarch more!Because with Thee I can adorn my Throne.MANFRED, who fell by Tyrant WILLIAM'S Rage,Fam'd ROGER'S lineal Issue, was my Father.[pausing.You droop, my Love; dejected on a sudden;You seem to mourn my Fortune—The soft TearSprings in thy Eye—O let me kiss it off—Why this, my SIGISMUNDA?SIGISMUNDA.Royal TANCRED,None at your glorious Fortune can like meRejoice;—yet me alone, of all Sicilians,It makes unhappy.TANCRED.I should hate it then!Should throw, with Scorn, the splendid Ruin from me!—No, SIGISMUNDA, 'tis my Hope with TheeTo share it, whence it draws it's richest Value.SIGISMUNDA.You are my Sovereign—I at humble Distance—TANCRED.Thou art my Queen! the Sovereign of my Soul!You never reign'd with such hant Luster,Such winning Charms as now; yet, thou art stillThe dear, the tender, generous SIGISMUNDA!Who, with a Heart exalted far aboveThose selfish Views that charm the common Breast,Stoop'd from the Height of Life and courted Beauty,
Then, then, to love me, when I seem'd of FortuneThe hopeless Outcast, when I had no Friend,None to protect and own me but thy Father.And would'st thou claim all Goodness to thyself?Canst thou thy TANCRED deem so dully form'd,Of such gross Clay, just as I reach the Point—A Point my wildest Hopes could never image—In that great Moment, full of every Virtue,That I should then so mean a Traytor proveTo the best Bliss and Honour of Mankind,So much disgrace the human Heart, as then,For the dead Form of Flattery and Pomp,The faithless Joys of Courts, to quit kind Truth,The cordial Sweets of Friendship and of Love,The Life of Life! my All, my SIGISMUNDA!I could upbraid thy Fears, call them unkind,Cruel, unjust, an Outrage to my Heart,Did they not spring from Love.SIGISMUNDA.Think not, my Lord,That to such vulgar Doubts I can descend.Your Heart, I know, disdains the little ThoughtOf changing with the vain external ChangeOf Circumstance and Fortune. Rather thenceIt would, with rising Ardor, greatly feelA noble Pride to shew itself the same.But, ah! the Hearts of Kings are not their own.There is a haughty Duty that subjects themTo Chains of State, to wed the publick Welfare,And not indulge the tender private Virtues.Some high-descended Princess, who will bringNew Power and Interest to your Throne demandsYour royal Hand—perhaps CONSTANTIA—TANCRED.She!O name her not! Were I this Moment free,And disengag'd as he who never feltThe powerful Eye of Beauty, never sigh'd
For matchless Worth like thine, I should abhorAll Thoughts of that Alliance. Her fell FatherMost basely murder'd mine; and she, the Daughter,Supported by his barbarous Party still,His Pride inherits, his imperious Spirit,And insolent Pretensions to my Throne.And canst thou deem me then so poorly tame,So cool a Traitor to my Father's Blood,As from the prudent Cowardice of StateE'er to submit to such a base Proposal?Detested Thought! O doubly, doubly hateful!From the two strongest Passions; from AversionTo this CONSTANTIA—and from Love to Thee.Custom, 'tis true, a venerable Tyrant,O'er servile Man extends her blind Dominion:The Pride of Kings enslaves them; their Ambition,Or Interest, lords it o'er the better Passions.But vain their Talk, mask'd under specious WordsOf Station, Duty, and of Public Good:They whom just Heaven has to a Throne exalted,To guard the Rights and Liberties of others,What Duty binds them to betray their own?For me, my freeborn Heart shall bear no Dictates,But those of Truth and Honour; wear no Chains,But the dear Chains of Love and SIGISMUNDA!Or if indeed my Choice must be directedBy Views of Publick Good, whom shall I chuseSo fit to grace to dignify a Crown,And beam sweet Mercy on a happy People,As Thee, my Love? whom place upon my ThroneBut Thee, descended from the good SIFFREDI?'Tis fit that Heart be thine, which drew from himWhate'er can make it worthy thy Acceptance.SIGISMUNDA.Cease, cease, to raise my Hopes above my Duty.Charm me no more, my TANCRED!—O that WeIn those blest Woods, where first you won my Soul,Had pass'd our gentle Days; far from the Toil
And Pomp of Courts! Such is the Wish of Love;Of Love, that, with delightful Weakness, knowsNo Bliss and no Ambition but itself.But, in the World's full Light, those charming Dreams,Those fond Illusions vanish. Awful Duties,The Tyranny of Men, even your own Heart,Where lurks a Sense your Passion stifles now,And proud imperious Honour call you from me.'Tis all in vain—You cannot hush a VoiceThat murmrrs here—I must not be persuaded!TANCRED, kneeling.Hear me, thou Soul of all my Hopes and Wishes!And witness, Heaven! Prime Source of Love and Joy!Not a whole warring World combin'd against me;It's Pride, it's Splendor, it's imposing Forms,Nor Interest, nor Ambition, nor the FaceOf solemn State, not even thy Father's Wisdom,Shall ever shake my Faith to SIGISMUNDA![Trumpets and Acclamations heard.But, hark! the Publick Voice to Duties calls me,Which with unweary'd Zeal I will discharge;And Thou, yes Thou, shalt be my bright Reward—Yet—ere I go—to hush thy lovely Fears,Thy delicate Objections— [writes his Name.Take this Blank,Sign'd with my Name, and give it to thy Father:Tell him 'tis my Command, it be fill'd upWith a most strict and solemn Marriage-Contract.How dear each Tie! how charming to my Soul!That more unites me to my SIGISMUNDA.For thee and for my People's Good to live,Is all the Bliss which sovereign Power can give.ACT II.SCENE I.SIFFREDI alone.SO far 'tis well—The late King's Will proceedsUpon the Plan I counsel'd; that Prince TANCREDShall make CONSTANTIA Partner of his Throne.O great, O wish'd Event! whence the dire SeedsOf dark intestine Broils, of Civil War,And all it's dreadful Miseries and Crimes,Shall be for ever rooted from the Land.May these dim Eyes, long blasted by the RageOf cruel Faction and my Country's Woes,Tir'd with the Toils and Vanities of Life,Behold this Period, then be clos'd in Peace!But how this mighty Obstacle surmount,Which Love has thrown betwixt? Love, that disturbsThe Schemes of Wisdom still; that wing'd with Passion,Blind and impetuous in it's fond Pursuits,Leaves the grey-headed Reason far behind.Alas! how frail the State of human Bliss!When even our honest Passions oft destroy it.I was to blame, in Solitude and Shades,Infectious Scenes!  trust their youthful Hearts.Would I had mark'd the rising Flame! that now
Burns out with dangerous Force—My Daughter ownsHer Passion for the King; she trembling own'd it,With Prayers and Tears and tender Supplications,That almost shook my Firmness—And this Blank,Which his rash Fondness gave her, shews how much,To what a wild Extravagance he loves—I see no Means—it oils my deepest Thought—How to controul this Madness of the King,That wears the Face of Virtue, and will thenceDisdain Restraint, will from his generous HeartBorrow new Rage, even speciously opposeTo Reason Reason—But it must be done.My own Advice, of which I more and moreApprove, the strict Conditions of the Will,Highly demand his Marriage with CONSTANTIA;Or else her Party has a fair Pretence,And all, at once, is Horror and Confusion—How issue from this Maze?—The crouding BaronsHere summon'd to the Palace, meet already,To pay their Homage, and confirm the Will.On a few Moments hangs the Publick Fate,On a few hasty Moments—Ha! there shoneA Gleam of Hope—Yes—with this very PaperI yet will save him—Necessary MeansFor good and noble Ends can ne'er be wrong.In that resistless, that peculiar Case,Deceit is Truth and Virtue—But how holdThis Lion in the Toil?—O  will form itOf such a fatal Thread, twist it so strongWith all the Ties of Honour and of Duty,That his most desperate Fury shall not breakThe honest Snare—Here is the Royal Hand—I will beneath it write a perfect ullAnd absolute Agreement to the Will;Which read before the Nobles of the RealmAssembled, in the sacred Face of Sicily,CONSTANTIA present, every Heart and EyeFix'd on their Monarch, every Tongue applauding,
He must submit, his Dream of Love must vanish—It shall be done!—To me, I know, 'tis Ruin;But Safety to the Publick, to the King.I will not reason more, I will not listenEven to the Voice of Honour—No—'tis fix'd!I here devote me for my Prince and Country;Let them be safe, and let me nobly perish!Behold Earl OSMOND comes; without whose AidMy Schemes are all in vain.SCENE II.OSMOND. SIFFREDI.OSMOND.My Lord SIFFREDI,I from the Council hasten'd to CONSTANTIA,And have accomplish'd what we there propos'd.The Princess to the Will submits her Claims.She with her Presence means to grace the Senate,And of your royal Charge young TANCRED'S HandAccept. At first indeed, it shock'd her HopesOf reigning sole, this new surprizing SceneOf MANFRED'S Son, appointed by the KingWith Her Joint-Heir—But I so fully shew'dThe Justice of the Case, the publick GoodAnd sure establish'd Peace which thence would rise,Join'd to the strong Necessity that urg'd her,If on Sicilia's Throne she meant to sit,As to the wise Disposal of the WillHer high Ambition tam'd. Methought, besides,I could discern that not from Prudence meerlyShe to this Choice submitted.SIFFREDI.Noble OSMOND,You have in this done to the Publick greatAnd signal Service. Yes, I must avow it;
This frank and ready Instance of your Zeal,In such a trying Crisis of the State,When Interest and Ambition might have warp'dYour Views; I own, this truly generous VirtueUpbraids the Rashness of my former Judgment.OSMOND.SIFFREDI, no.—To you belongs the Praise;The glorious Work is yours. Had I not seiz'd,Improv'd the wish'd Occasion to root outDivision from the Land, and save my Country,I had been base, been infamous for ever.'Tis You, my Lord, to whom the many Thousands,That by the barbarous Sword of Civil WarHad fallen inglorious, owe their Lives; to YouThe Sons of this fair Isle, from her first PeersDown to the Swain who tills her golden Plains,Owe their safe Homes, their soft domestick Hours,And thro' late Time Posterity shall bless you,You who advis'd this Will—I blush to think,I have so long oppos'd the best good ManIn Sicily—With what impartial CareOught we to watch o'er Prejudice and Passion,Nor trust too much the jaundic'd Eye of Party!Henceforth it's vain Delusions I renounce,It's hot Determinations, that confineAll Merit and all Virtue to itself.To yours I join my Hand; with you will ownNo Interest and no Party but my Country.Nor is your Friendship only my Ambition:There is a dearer Name, the Name of Father,By which I should rejoice to call SIFFREDI.Your Daughter's Hand would to the Publick WealUnite my private Happiness.SIFFREDI.My Lord,You have my glad Consent. To be alliedTo your distinguish'd Family, and Merit,I shall esteem an Honour. From my Soul
I here embrace Earl OSMOND as my Friend,And Son.OSMOND.You make him happy. This Assent,So frank and warm, to what I long have wish'd,Engages all my Gratitude; at once,In the first Blossom, it matures our Friendship.I from this Moment vow myself the Friend,And zealous Servant of SIFFREDI'S House.Enter an Officer belonging to the Court.OFFICER to SIFFREDI.The King, my Lord, demands your speedy Presence.SIFFREDI.I will attend him strait—Farewel, my Lord:The Senate meets; there, a few Moments hence,I will rejoin you.OSMOND.There, my noble Lord,We will compleat this salutary Work,Will there begin a new auspicious Era.SCENE III.OSMOND alone.SIFFREDI gives his Daughter to my Wishes—But does she give herself? Gay, young, and flatter'd,Perhaps engag'd, will she her youthful HeartYield to my harsher, uncomplying Years?I am not form'd, by Flattery and Praise,By Sighs and Tears, and all the whining TradeOf Love, to feed a Fair-one's Vanity;To charm at once and spoil her. These soft ArtsNor suit my Years nor Temper; these be leftTo Boys and doating Age. A prudent Father,By Nature charg'd to guide and rule her Choice,
Resigns his Daughter to a Husband's Power,Who with superior Dignity, with Reason,And manly Tenderness, will ever love her;Not first a kneeling Slave, and then a Tyrant.SCENE IV.OSMOND. BARONS.OSMOND.My Lords, I greet you well. This wondrous DayUnites us all in Amity and Friendship.We meet to-day with open Hearts and Looks,Not gloom'd by Party, scouling on each other,But all the Children of one happy Isle,The social Sons of Liberty. No Pride,No Passion now, no thwarting Views divide us:Prince MANFRED'S Line, at last, to WILLIAM'S join'd,Combines us in one Family of Brothers.This to the late good King's well-order'd Will,And wise SIFFREDI'S generous Care we owe.I truly give you Joy. First of you all,I here renounce those Errors and DivisionsThat have so long disturb'd our Peace, and seem'd,Fermenting still, to threaten new Commotions—By Time instructed, let us not disdainTo quit Mistakes. We all, my Lords, have err'd.Men may, I find, be honest tho' they differ.1st BARON.Who follows not, my Lord, the fair ExampleYou set us all, whate'er be his Pretence,Loves not with single and unbiass'd HeartHis Country as he ought.2d BARON.O beaureous Peace!Sweet Union of a State! What else, but Thou,
Gives Safety, Strength, and Glory to a PeopleI bow, Lord Constable, beneath the SnowOf many Years: yet in my Breast revivesA youthful Flame. Methinks, I see againThose gentle Days renew'd, that bless'd our Isle,Ere by this wasteful Fury of Division,Worse than our Aetna's most destructive Fires,It desolated, sunk. I see our PlainsUnbounded waving with the Gifts of Harvest;Our Seas with Commerce throng'd, our busy PortsWith chearful Toil. Our Enna blooms afresh;A fresh the Sweets of thy my Hybla flow.Our Nymphs and Shepherds, sporting in each Vale,Inspire new Song, and wake the pastoral Reed—The Tongue of Age is fond—Come, come, my SonsI long to see this Prince, of whom the WorldSpeaks largely well—His Father was my Friend,The brave unhappy MANFRED—Come, my Lords;We tarry here too long.SCENE V.TWO OFFICERS, keeping off the Croud.One of the Croud.Shew us our King,The valiant MANFRED'S Son, who lov'd the People—We must, we will behold him—Give us way.1st OFFICER.Pray, Gentlemen, give back—it must not be—Give back, I pray—on such a glad OccasionI would not ill entreat the lowest of you.2d MAN of the Croud.Nay, give us but a Glimpse of our young King.We more than any Baron of them allWill pay him true Allegiance.2d OFFICER.Friends—indeed—You cannot pass this Way—We have strict Orders,To keep for Him himself, and for the Barons,All these Apartments clear—Go to the GateThat fronts the Sea—You there will find Admission.ALL.Long live King TANCRED! MANFRED'S Son—Huzza![Croud goes off.1st OFFICER.I do not marvel at their Rage of Joy:He is a brave and amiable Prince.When in my Lord SIFFREDI'S House I liv'd,Ere by his Favour I obtain'd this Office,I there remember well the young Count TANCRED.To see him and to love him were the same.He was so noble in his Ways, yet stillSo affable and mild—Well, well, old Sicily,Yet happy Days await thee!2d OFFICER.Grant it Heaven!We have seen sad and troublous Times enough.He is, they say, to wed the late King's Sister,CONSTANTIA.1st OFFICER.Friend, of That I greatly doubt.Or I mistake, or Lord SIFFREDI'S DaughterThe gentle SIGISMUNDA has his Heart.If one may judge by kindly cordial Looks,And fond assiduous Care to please each other,Most certainly they love—O be they blest,As they deserve! It were great Pity aughtShould part a matchless Pair: the Glory He,And She the blooming Grace of Sicily!2d OFFICER.My Lord RODOLPHO comes.SCENE VI.RODOLPHO, from the Senate.RODOLPHO.My honest Friends,You may retire.[Officers go out.A Storm is in the Wind.This Will perplexes all. No, TANCRED neverCan stoop to these Conditions, which at onceAttack his Rights, his Honour, and his Love.Those wise old Men, those plodding grave State-Pedants,Forget the Course of Youth; their crooked Prudence,To Baseness verging still, forgets to takeInto their fine-spun Schemes the generous Heart,That thro' the Cobweb System bursting laysTheir Labours waste—So will this Business prove,Or I mistake the King—Back from the PompHe seem'd at first to shrink; and round his BrowI mark'd a gathering Cloud, when by his Side,As if design'd to share the public Homage,He saw the Tyrant's Daughter. But confess'd,At least to me, the doubling Tempest frown'd,And shook his swelling Bosom, when he heardTh' unjust the base Conditions of the Will.Uncertain tost, in cruel Agitation,He oft, methought, address'd himself to speakAnd interrupt SIFFREDI; who appear'd,With conscious haste, to dread that Interruption,And hurry'd on—But hark! I hear a Noise,As if th' Assembly rose?—Ha! SIGISMUNDA,Oppress'd with Grief and wrapt in pensive Sorrow, along—[SIGISMUNDA and Attendants pass thro' the Back Scene. LAURA advances.SCENE VII.RODOLPHO, LAURA.LAURA.Your high-prais'd Friend, the King,Is false, most vilely false! The meanest SlaveHad shown a nobler Heart; nor grossly thus,By the first Bait Ambition spread, been gull'd.He MANFRED'S Son! away! it cannot be!The Son of that brave Prince could ne'er betrayThose Rights so long usurp'd from his great Fathers,Which he, this Day, by such amazing Fortune,Had just regain'd; he ne'er could sacrificeAll Faith, all Honour, Gratitude and Love,Even just Resentment of his Father's Fate,And Pride itself; whate'er exalts a ManAbove the groveling Sons of Peasant-Mud,All in a Moment—And for what? Why, truelyFor kind Permission, gracious Leave, to sitOn his own Throne with Tyrant WILLIAM'S Daughter!RODOLPHO.I stand amaz'd—You surely wrong him, LAURA.There must be some Mistake.LAURA.There can be none!SIFFREDI read his full and free Consent,Before th' applauding Senate. True indeed,A small Remain of Shame, a timorous Weakness,Even dastardly in Falshood, made him blushTo act this Scene in SIGISMUNDA'S Eye,Who sunk beneath his Perfidy and Baseness.Hence, till to-morrow he adjourn'd the Senate—To-morrow fix'd with Infamy to crown him!Then, leading off his gay triumphant Princess,
He left the poor unhappy SIGISMUNDA,To bend her trembling Steps to that sad HomeHis faithless Vows will render hateful to her—He comes—Farewel—I cannot bear his Presence!SCENE VIII.TANCRED, SIFFREDI, RODOLPHO.TANCRED, entering, to SIFFREDI.Avoid me, hoary Traitor!—Go, RODOLPHO,Give Orders that all Passages this WayBe shut—Defend me from a hateful World,The Bane of Peace and Honour—then return—What! dost Thou haunt me still? O monstrous Insult!Unparallel'd Indignity! Just Heaven!Was ever King, was ever Man so treated?So trampled into Baseness!SIFFREDI.Here, my Liege,Here strike! I nor deserve, nor ask for Mercy.TANCRED.Distraction!—O my Soul!—Hold, Reason, holdThy giddy Seat—O this inhuman OutrageUnhinges Thought!SIFFREDI.Exterminate thy Servant!TANCRED.All, all but this I could have borne—but This!This daring Insolence beyond Example!This murderous Stroke that stabs my Peace for ever!That wounds me there—there! where the human HeartMost exquisetely feels—SIFFREDI.O bear it not,My royal Lord! appease on me your Vengeance!TANCRED.Did ever Tyrant image aught so cruel!The lowest Slave that crawls upon this Earth,Robb'd of each Comfort Heaven bestows on Mortals,On the bare Ground, has still his Virtue left,The sacred Treasures of an honest Heart,Which thou hast dar'd, with rash audacious Hand,And impious Fraud, in me to violate—SIFFREDI.Behold, my Liege, that rash audacious Hand,Which not repents its Crime—O glorious! happy!If by my Ruin I can save your Honour.TANCRED.Such Honour I renounce! with sovereign ScornGreatly detest it, and its mean Adviser!Hast thou not dar'd beneath my Name to shelter—My Name for other Purposes design'd,Given from the Fondness of a faithful Heart,With the best Love o'erflowing—hast thou notBeneath thy Sovereign's Name basely presum'dTo shield a Lye? a Lye! in Public utter'd,To all deluded Sicily? But know,This poor Contrivance is as weak as base.In such a wretched Toil none can be heldBut Fools and Cowards—O thy slimsy Arts,Touch'd by my just my burning Indignation,Shall burst like Threads in Flame!—Thy doating Prudence,But more secures the Purpose it would shake.Had my Resolves been wavering and doubtful,This would confirm them, make them fix'd as Fate;This adds the only Motive that was wantingTo urge them on thro' War and Desolation—What! marry Her! CONSTANTIA! Her! the Daughter
Of the fell Tyrant who destroy'd my Father!The very Thought is Madness! Ere thou seestThe Torch of HYMEN light these hated Nuptials,Thou shalt behold Sicilia wrapt in Flames,Her Cities raz'd, her Valleys drench'd with Slaughter—Love set aside—my Pride assumes the Quarrel.My Honour now is up; in spite of Thee,A World combin'd against me, I will giveThis scatter'd Will in fragments to the Winds,Assert my Rights, the Freedom of my Heart,Crush all who dare oppose me to the Dust,And heap Perdition on Thee!SIFFREDI.Sir, 'tis just.Exhaust on me your Rage; I claim it all.But for these public Threats thy Passion utters,'Tis what Thou canst not do!TANCRED.I cannot! Ha!Driven to the dreadful Brink of suck Dishonour,Enough to make the tamest Coward brave,And into Fierceness rouze the mildest Nature,What shall arrest my Vengeance? who?SIFFREDI.Thy Self!TANCRED.Away! dare not to justify thy Crime!That That alone can aggravate it's Horror,Add Insolence to Insolence—perhapsMay make my Rage forget—SIFFREDI.O let it burstOn this grey Head devoted to thy Service!But when the Storm has vented all it's Fury,Thou then must hear—nay more, I know, thou wilt—Wilt hear the calm, yet stronger Voice of Reason.Thou must reflect that a whole People's Safety,
The Weal of trusted Millions should bear down,Thy self the Judge, thy fondest partial Pleasure.Thou must reflect that there are other Duties,A nobler Pride, a more exalted Honour,Superior Pleasures far, that will oblige,Compel thee, to abide by this my Deed,Unwarranted perhaps in common Justice,But which Necessity, even Virtue's Tyrant,With awful Voice commanded—Yes, thou must,In calmer hours, divest thee of thy Love,These common Passions of the vulgar Breast,This boiling Heat of Youth, and be a King!The Lover of thy People!TANCRED.Truths ill-employ'd!Abus'd to colour Guilt!—a King! a King!Yes I will be a King, but not a Slave!In This will be a King! in this my PeopleShall learn to judge how I will guard their Rights,When they behold me vindicate my own.But have I, say, been treated like a King?—Heavens! could I stoop to such outragious Usage,I were a mean a shameless Wretch, unworthyTo wield a Scepter in a Land of Slaves,A Soil abhor'd of Virtue, should belyMy Father's Blood, bely those very Maxims,At other times, you taught my Youth—SIFFREDI![in a softened Tone of Voice.SIFFREDI.Behold, my Prince, behold thy poor old Servant,Whose darling Care, these twenty Years, has beenTo nurse thee up to Virtue; who for Thee,Thy Glory and thy Weal, renounces all,All Interest or Ambition can pour forth;What many a selfish Father would pursueThro' Treachery and Crimes: behold him here,Bent on his feeble Knees, to beg, conjure Thee,With Tears to beg Thee, to controul thy Passion,
And save thy self, thy Honour, and thy People!Kneeling with me, behold the many ThousandsTo thy Protection trusted: Fathers, Mothers,The sacred Front of venerable Age,The tender Virgin and the helpless Infant;The Ministers of Heaven, Those, who maintain,Around thy Throne, the Majesty of Rule;And Those, whose Labour, scorch'd by Winds and Sun,Feeds the rejoicing Public: see them all,Here at thy Feet, conjuring Thee to save them,From Misery and War, from Crimes and Rapine!Can there be aught, kind Heaven! in Self-indulgenceTo weigh down These? This Aggregate of Love,With which compar'd the dearest private PassionIs but the wafted Dust upon the Ballance?Turn not away—Oh is there not some Part,In thy great Heart, so sensible to Kindness,And generous Warmth, some nobler Part, to feelThe Prayers and Tears of These, the mingled VoiceOf Heaven and Earth!TANCRED.There is! and thou hast touch'd it.Rise, rise, SIFFREDI—Oh! Thou hast undone me,Unkind old Man!—O ill-entreated TANCRED!Which Way soe'er I turn, Dishonour rearsHer hideous Front—and Misery and Ruin!Was it for This you took such Care to form me?For This imbued me with the quickest SenseOf Shame; these finer Feelings, that ne'er vexThe common Mass of Mortals, dully happyIn blest Insensibility? O ratherYou should have ear'd my Heart; taught me that PowerAnd splendid Interest lord it still o'er Virtue;That, gilded by Prosperity and Pride,There is no Shame, no Meanness: temper'd thus,I had been fit to rule a venal World.
Alas! what meant thy Wantonness of Prudence?Why have you rais'd this miserable ConflictBetwixt the Duties of the King and Man?Set Virtue against Virtue?—Ah SIFFREDI!'Tis thy superfluous, thy unfeeling Wisdom,That has involv'd me in a Maze of Error,Almost beyond Retreat—But hold, my Soul,Thy steady Purpose—Tost by various Passions,To this eternal Anchor keep—There is,Can be, no Public without Private Virtue—Then mark me well, observe what I command;It is the sole Expedient now remaining—To-morrow, when the Senate meets again,Unfold the whole, unravel the Deceit;Nor That alone, try to repair it's Mischief;There all thy Power, thy Eloquence and Interest,Exert, to reinstate me in my Rights,And from thy own dark Snares to disembroil me—Start not, my Lord—This must and shall be done!Or here our Friendship ends—Howe'er disguis'd,Whatever thy Pretence, thou art a Traitor!SIFFREDI.I should indeed deserve the Name of Traitor,And even a Traitor's Fate, had I so slightly,From Principles so weak, done what I did,As e'er to disavow it—TANCRED.Ha!SIFFREDI.My Liege,Expect not This—Tho' practis'd long in Courts,I have not so far learn'd their subtle Trade,To veer obedient with each Gust of Passion.I honour Thee, I venerate thy Orders,But honour more my Duty. Nought on EarthShall ever shake me from that solid Rock,Nor Smiles nor Frowns.—TANCRED.You will not then?SIFFREDI.I cannot!TANCRED.Away! Begone!—O my RODOLPHO, come,And save me from this Traitor!—Hence, I say,Avoid my Presence strait! and, know, old Man,Thou my worst Foe beneath the Mask of Friendship,Who, not content to trample in the DustMy dearest Rights, dost with cool InsolencePersist, and call it Duty; hadst thou notA Daughter that protects thee, thou shouldst feelThe Vengeance thou deservest—No Reply!Away!SCENE IX.TANCRED. RODOLPHO.RODOLPHO.What can incense my Prince so highlyAgainst his Friend SIFFREDI?TANCRED.Friend! RODOLPHO?When I have told thee what this Friend has done,How play'd me like a Boy, a base born Wretch,Who had nor Heart nor Spirit! thou wilt standAmaz'd, and wonder at my stupid Patience.RODOLPHO.I heard, with mixt Astonishment and Grief,The King's unjust dishonourable Will,Void in itself—I saw you stung with Rage,And writhing in the Snare; just as I went,At your Command, to wait you here—But ThatWas the King's Deed, not his.TANCRED.O He advis'd it!These many Years he has in secret hatch'dThis black Contrivance, glories in the Scheme,And proudly plumes him with his traiterous Virtue.But that was nought, RODOLPHO, nothing, nothing!O that was gentle, blameless to what follow'd!I had, my Friend, to SIGISMUNDA given,To hush her Fears, in the full Gush of Fondness,A Blank sign'd by my Hand—and he—O Heavens!Was ever such a wild Attempt!—he wroteBeneath my Name an absolute ComplianceTo this detested Will; nay, dar'd to read itBefore my self, on my insulted ThroneHis idle Pageant plac'd—Oh! Words are weak,To paint the Pangs, the Rage, the Indignation;That whirl'd from Thought to Thought my Soul in Tempest,Now on the Point to burst, and now by ShameRepress'd—But in the Face of Sicily,All mad with Acclamation, what, RODOLPHO,What could I do? The sole Relief that roseTo my distracted Mind, was to adjournTh' Assembly till To-morrow—But To-morrowWhat can be done?—O it avails not what!I care not what is done—My only CareIs how to clear my Faith to SIGISMUNDA.She thinks me false! She cast a Look that kill'd me!O I am base in SIGISMUNDA'S Eye!The lowest of Mankind, the most perfidious!RODOLPHO.This was a Strain of Insolence indeed,A daring Outrage of so strange a Nature,As stuns me quite—TANCRED.Curs'd be my timid Prudence!That dash'd not back, that Moment, in his Face,The bold presumptuous Lye—and curs'd this Hand!
That from a Start of poor Dissimulation,Led off my SIGISMUNDA'S hated Rival.Ah then! what, poison'd by the false Appearance,What, SIGISMUNDA, were thy Thoughts of me!How, in the silent Bitterness of Soul,How didst thou scorn me! hate Mankind, thy self,For trusting to the Vows of faithless TANCRED!For such I seem'd—I was!—The Thought distracts me!I should have cast a flattering World aside,Rush'd from my Throne, before them all avow'd Her,The Choice, the Glory of my free-born Heart,And spurn'd the shameful Fetters thrown upon it—Instead of that—Confusion!—what I didHas clinch'd the Chain, confirm'd SIFFREDI'S Crime,And fix'd me down to Infamy!RODOLPHO.My Lord,Blame not the Conduct, which your SituationTore from your tortur'd Heart—What could you do?Had you so circumstanc'd, in open Senate,Before th' astonish'd Publick, with no FriendsPrepar'd, no Party form'd, affronted thusThe haughty Princess and her powerful Faction,Supported by this Will, the sudden Stroke,Abrupt and premature, might have recoil'dUpon your self, even your own Friends revolted,And turn'd at once the publick Scale against you.Besides, consider, had you then detected,In its fresh Guilt this Action of SIFFREDI,You must with signal Vengeance have chastis'dThe treasonable Deed—Nothing so meanAs weak insulted Power that dares not punish.And how would that have suited with your Love?His Daughter present too? Trust me, your Conduct,Howe'er abhorrent to a Heart like yours,
Was fortunate and wise—Not that I meanE'er to advise Submission—TANCRED.Heavens! Submission!Could I descend to bear it, even in Thought,Despise me, you, the World, and SIGISMUNDA!Submission!—No!—To-morrow's glorious LightShall flash Discovery on this Scene of Baseness.Whatever be the Risque, by Heavens! To-morrow,I will o'erturn the dirty Lye-built SchemesOf these old Men, and shew my faithful Senate,That MANFRED'S Son knows to assert and wear,With undiminish'd Dignity, that CrownThis unexpected Day has plac'd upon him.But This, my Friend, these stormy Gusts of PrideAre foreign to my Love—Till SIGISMUNDABe disabus'd, my Breast is Tumult all,And can obey no settled Course of Reason.I see Her still, I feel her powerful Image!That Look, where with Reproach Complaint was mix'd,Big with soft Woe and gentle Indignation,Which seem'd at once to pity and to scorn me—O let me find Her! I too long have leftMy SIGISMUNDA to converse with Tears,A Prey to Thoughts that picture me a Villain.But ah! how, clogg'd with this accursed State,A tedious World, shall I now find Access?Her Father too—Ten Thousand Horrors croudInto the wild fantastic Eye of Love—Who knows what he may do? Come then, my Friend,And by thy Sister's Hand O let me stealA Letter to her Bosom—I no longerCan bear her Absence, by the just ContemptShe now must brand me with, inflam'd to Madness,Fly, my RODOLPHO, fly! engage thy SisterTo aid my Letter, and this very Evening
Secure an Interview—I would not bearThis Rack another Day not for my Kingdom!Till then deep-plung'd in Solitude and Shades,I will not see the hated Face of Man.Thought drives on Thought, on Passions Passions roll;Her Smiles alone can calm my raging Soul.ACT III.SCENE I.SIGISMUNDA alone, sitting in a disconsolate Posture.AH Tyrant Prince! ah more than faithless TANCRED!Ungenerous and inhuman in thy Falsehood!Hadst Thou, this Morning, when my hopeless Heart,Submissive to my Fortune and my Duty,Had so much Spirit left, as to be willingTo give Thee back thy Vows, ah! hadst Thou thenConfess'd the sad Necessity thy StateImpos'd upon Thee, and with gentle Friendship,Since we must part at last, our Parting soften'd;I should indeed—I should have been unhappy,But not to this Extream—Amidst my Grief,I had, with pensive Pleasure, cherish'd stillThe sweet Remembrance of thy former Love,Thy Image still had dwelt upon my Soul,And made our guiltless Woes not undelightful.But coolly thus—How couldst thou be so cruel?—Thus to revive my Hopes, to soothe my Love
And call forth all its Tenderness, then sink meIn black Despair—What unrelenting PridePossess'd thy Breast, that thou couldst bea unmov'dTo see me bent beneath a Weight of Shame?Pangs thou canst never feel? How couldst thou drag me,In barbarous Triumph at a Rival's Car?How make me Witness to a Sight of Horror?That Hand, which, but a few short Hours ago,So wantonly abus'd my simple Faith,Before th' attesting World given to another,Irrevocably given!—There was a Time,When the least Cloud that hung upon my Brow,Perhaps imagin'd only, touch'd thy Pity.Then, brighten'd often by the ready Tear,Thy Looks were Softness all; then the quick Heart,In every Nerve alive, forgot it self,And for each other then we felt alone.But now, alas! those tender Days are fled;Now thou canst see me wretched, pierc'd with Anguish,With studied Anguish of thy own creating,Nor wet thy harden'd Eye—Hold, let me think—I wrong Thee sure; Thou canst not be so base,As meanly in my Misery  triumph—What is it then?—Why should I search for Pain?—O 'tis as bad!—'Tis Fickleness of Nature,'Tis sickly Love extinguish'd by Ambition—Is there, kind Heaven! no Constancy in Man?No stedfast Truth, no generous fix'd Affection,That can bear up against a selfish World?No, there is none—Even TANCRED is inconstant![Rising.Hence! let me fly this Scene!—Whate'er I see,These Roofs, these Walls, each Object that surrounds me,Are tainted with his Vows—But whither fly?
The Groves are worse, the soft Retreat of Belmont,It's deepening Glooms, gay Lawns, and airy Summits,Will wound my busy Memory to Torture,And all its Shades will whisper—faithless TANCRED!—My Father comes—How, sunk in this Disorder,Shall I sustain his Presence?SCENE II.SIFFREDI, SIGISMUNDA.SIFFREDI.SIGISMUNDA,My dearest Child! I grieve to find Thee thusA Prey to Tears. I know the powerful CauseFrom which they flow, and therefore can excuse them,But not their wilful obstinate Continuance.Come, rouse Thee then, call up thy drooping Spirit,Come, wake to Reason from this Dream of Love,And shew the World thou art SIFFREDI'S Daughter.SIGISMUNDA.Alas! I am unworthy of that Name.SIFFREDI.Thou art indeed to blame; thou hast too rashlyEngag'd thy Heart, without a Father's Sanction.But this I can forgive. The King has Virtues,That plead thy full Excuse; nor was I voidOf Blame, to trust Thee to those dangerous Virtues.Then dread not my Reproaches. Tho' he blames,Thy tender Father pities more than blames Thee.Thou art my Daughter still; and, if thy HeartWill now resume its Pride, assert itself,And greatly rise superior to this Trial,I to my warmest Confidence againWill take thee, and esteem thee more my DaughterSIGISMUNDA.O you are gentler far than I deserve!It is, it ever was, my darling Pride,To bend my Soul to your supreme Commands,Your wisest Will; and tho', by Love betray'd—Alas! and punish'd too—I have transgress'dThe nicest Bounds of Duty, yet I feelA Sentiment of Tenderness, a SourceOf filial Nature springing in my Breast,That, should it kill me, shall controul this Passion,And make me all Submission and ObedienceTo you, my honour'd Lord, the best of Fathers.SIFFREDI.Come to my Arms, Thou Comfort of my Age!Thou only Joy and Hope of these grey Hairs!Come! let me take Thee to a Parent's Heart;There with the kindly Aid of my Advice,Even with the Dew of these paternal Tears,Revive and nourish this becoming Spirit—Then Thou dost promise me, my SIGISMUNDA—Thy Father stoops to make it his Request—Thou wilt resign thy fond presumptuous Hopes,And henceforth never more indulge one ThoughtThat in the Light of Love regards the King?SIGISMUNDA.Hopes I have none!—Those by this fatal DayAre blasted all—But from my Soul  banish,While weeping Memory there retains her Seat,Thoughts which the purest Bosom might have cherish'd,Once my Delight, now even in Anguish charming,Is more, alas! my Lord, than I can promise.SIFFREDI.Absence and Time, the Softner of our Passions,Will conquer This. Mean time, I hope from TheeA generous great Effort; that Thou wilt nowExert thy utmost Force, nor languish thusBeneath the vain Extravagance of Love.
Let not thy Father blush to hear it said,Hs Daughter was so weak, e'er to admitA Thought so void of Reason, that a KingShould to his Rank, his Honour and his Glory,The high important Duties of a Throne,Even to his Throne itself, madly preferA wild  Passion, the fond ChildOf youthful dreaming Thought and vacant Hours;That He should quit his Heaven-appointed Station,Desert his awful Charge, the Care of allThe toiling Millions which this Isle contains;Nay more, shall plunge them into War and Ruin;And all to sooth a sick Imagination,A miserable Weakness—Must for thee,To make Thee blest, Sicilia be unhappy?The King himself, lost to the nobler SenseOf manly Praise, become the piteous HeroeOf some soft Tale, and rush on sure Destruction?Canst thou, my Daughter, let the monstrous ThoughtPossess one Moment thy perverted Fancy?Rouse thee, for Shame! and if a Spark of VirtueLies slumbering in thy Soul, bid it blaze forth;Nor sink unequal to the glorious Lesson,This Day thy Lover gave thee from his Throne.SIGISMUNDA.Ah, that was not from Virtue!—Had, my Father,That been his Aim, I yield to what you say;'Tis powerful Truth, unanswerable Reason.Then, then, with sad but duteous Resignation,I had submitted as became your Daughter;But in that Moment, when my humbled HopesWere to my Duty reconcil'd, to raise themTo yet a fonder Height than e'er they knew,Then rudely dash them down—There is the Sting▪The blasting View is ever present to me—Why did you drag me to a Sight so cruel?SIFFREDI.It was a Scene to fire thy Emulation.SIGISMUNDA.It was a Scene of Perfidy!—But know,I will do more than imitate the King—For he is false!—I, tho' sincerely pierc'dWith the best truest Passion ever touch'dA Virgin's Breast, here vow to Heaven and You,Tho' from my Heart I cannot, from my HopesTo cast this Prince—what would you more, my Father?SIFFREDI.Yes, one Thing more—thy Father then is happy—Tho' by the Voice of Innocence and VirtueAbsolv'd, we live not to our selves alone:A rigorous World, with peremptory Sway,Subjects us all, and even the Noblest most.This World from Thee, my Honour and thy own,Demands one Step; a Step, by which convinc'dThe King may see thy Heart disdains to wearA Chain which his has greatly thrown aside.'Tis fitting too, thy Sex's Pride commands Thee,To shew th' approving World thou canst resign,As well as He, nor with inferior Spirit,A Passion fatal to the Publick Weal.But, above all, thou must root our for everFrom the King's Breast the least Remain of Hope,And henceforth make is mention'd Love Dishonour.These Things, my Daughter, that must needs be done,Can but this way be done—by the safe Refuge,The sacred Shelter of a Husband's Arms.And there is one—SIGISMUNDA.Good Heavens! what means my Lord?SIFFREDI.One of illustrious Family, high Rank,Yet still of higher Dignity and Merit,
Who can, and will protect Thee; one to aweThe King himself—Nay, hear me, SIGISMUNDA—The noble OSMOND courts Thee for his Bride,And has my plighted Word—This Day—SIGISMUNDA kneeling.My Father!Let me with trembling Arms embrace thy Knees!O if you ever wish'd to see me happy;If e'er in infant Years I gave you Joy,When, as I prattling twin'd around your Neck,You snatch'd me to your Bosom, kiss'd my Eyes,And melting said you saw my Mother there;O save me from that worst SeverityOf Fate! O outrage not my breaking HeartTo that degree!—I cannot!—'tis impossible!—So soon withdraw it, give it to another—Hear me, my dearest Father! hear the VoiceOf Nature and Humanity, that pleadAs well as Justice for me!—Not to chuseWithout your wise Direction may be Duty;But still my Choice is free—That is a Right,Which even the lowest Slave can never lose.And would you thus degrade me? make me base?For such it were, to give my worthless PersonWithout my Heart, an Injury to OSMOND,The highest can be done—Let me, my Lord—Or I shall die, shall by the sudden ChangeBe to Distraction shock'd—Let me wear outMy hapless Days in Solitude and Silence,Far from the Malice of a prying World!At least—you cannot sure refuse me This—Give me a little Time—I will do all,All I can do, to please you!—O your EyeSheds a kind Beam—SIFFREDI.My Daughter! you abuseThe Softness of my Nature—SIGISMUNDA.Here, my Father,Till you relent, here will I grow for ever!SIFFREDI.Rise, SIGISMUNDA,—Tho' you touch my Heart,Nothing can shake th' inexorable DictatesOf Honour, Duty, and determin'd Reason.Then by the holy Ties of filial Love,Resolve, I charge Thee, to receive Earl OSMOND,As suits the Man who is thy Father's Choice,And worthy of thy Hand—I go to bring him—SIGISMUNDA.Spare me, my dearest Father!SIFFREDI, aside.I must rushFrom her soft Grasp, or Nature will betray me!O grant us, Heaven! that Fortitude of Mind,Which listens to our Duty, not our Passions—Quit me, my Child!SIGISMUNDA.You cannot, Oh my Father!You cannot leave me thus!SIFFREDI.Come hither, LAURA.Come to thy Friend. Now shew thy self a Friend.Combate her Weakness; dissipate her Tears;Cherish, and reconcile Her to her Duty.SCENE III.SIGISMUNDA. LAURA.SIGISMUNDA.O Woe on Woe! distrest by Love and Duty!O every way unhappy SIGISMUNDA!LAURA.Forgive me, Madam, if I blame your Grief.
How can you waste your Tears on one so false?Unworthy of your Tenderness? to whomNought but Contempt is due and Indignation?SIGISMUNDA.You know not half the Horrors of my Fate!I might perhaps have learn'd to scorn his Falsehood;Nay, when the first sad Burst of Tears was past,I might have rous'd my Pride and scorn'd Himself—But 'tis too much, this greatest last Misfortune—O whither shall I fly? Where hide me, LAURA,From the dire Scene my Father now prepares!LAURA.What thus alarms you, Madam?SIGISMUNDA.Can it be?Can I—ah no!—at once give to anotherMy violated Heart? in one wild Moment?He brings Earl OSMOND to receive my Vows!O dreadful Change! for TANCRED haughty OSMOND!LAURA.Now, on my Soul, 'tis what an outrag'd Heart,Like thine, should wish!—I should, by Heavens, esteem itMost exquisite Revenge!SIGISMUNDA.Revenge on whom?On my own Heart, already but too wretched!LAURA.On Him! this TANCRED! who has basely sold,For the dull Form of despicable Grandeur,His Faith, his Love!—At once a Slave and Tyrant!SIGISMUNDA.O rail at me, at my believing Folly,My vain ill-founded Hopes, but spare him, LAURA!LAURA.Who rais'd these Hopes? who triumphs o'er that Weakness?
Pardon the Word—You greatly merit him;Better than him, with all his giddy Pomp!You rais'd him by your Smiles when he was nothing!Where is your Woman's Pride? that guardian SpiritGiven us to dash the Perfidy of Man?Ye Powers! I cannot bear the Thought with Patience—Yet recent from the most unsparing VowsThe Tongue of Love e'er lavish'd; from your HopesSo vainly, idly, cruelly deluded;Before the Publick thus, before your Father,By an irrevocable solemn Deed,With such inhuman Scorn, to throw you from him!To give his faithless Hand yet warm from thine,With complicated Meanness, to CONSTANTIA!And to compleat his Crime, when thy weak LimbsCould scarce support thee, then, of Thee regardless,To lead Her off!SIGISMUNDA.That was indeed a SightTo poison Love! to turn it into RageAnd keen Contempt!—What means this stupid WeaknessThat hangs upon me? Hence unworthy Tears!Disgrace my Cheek no more! No more, my Heart,For one so coolly false or meanly fickle—O it imports not which—dare to suggestThe least Excuse!—Yes, Traitor, I will wringThy Pride, will turn thy Triumph to Confusion!I will not pine away my Days for Thee,Sighing to Brooks and Groves; while, with vain Pity,You in a Rival's Arms lament my Fate—No! let me perish! ere I tamely beThat soft, that patient, gentle SIGISMUNDA,
Who can console Her with the wretched Boast,She was for Thee unhappy!—If I am,I will be nobly so!—Sicilia's DaughtersShall wondering see in me a great ExampleOf one who punish'd her ill-judging Heart,Who made it bow to what it most abhorr'd!Crush'd it to Misery! for having thusSo lightly listen'd to a worthless Lover!LAURA.At last it mounts! the kindling Pride of Virtue!Trust me, thy Marriage will embitter His—SIGISMUNDA.O may the Furies light his Nuptial Torch!Be it accurs'd as mine! For the fair Peace,The tender Joys of Hymeneal Love,May Jealousy awak'd, and fell Remorse,Pour all their fiercest Venom thro' his Breast!—Where the Fates lead, and blind Revenge, I follow!—Let me not think—By injur'd Love! I vow,Thou shalt, base Prince! perfidious and inhuman!Thou shalt behold me in another's Arms!In his thou hatest! OSMOND'S!LAURA.That will grindHis Heart with secret Rage! Aye, that will stingHis Soul to Madness! set him up a Terror,A Spectacle of Woe to saithless Lovers!—Your cooler Thought, besides, will of the ChangeApprove, and think it happy. Noble OSMONDFrom the same Stock with him derives his Birth,First of Sicilian Barons, prudent, brave,Of strictest Honour, and by all rever'd—SIGISMUNDA.Talk not of OSMOND, but perfidious TANCRED!Rail at him, rail! invent new Names of Scorn!Assist me, LAURA; lend my Rage fresh Fewel;Support my staggering Purpose, which already
Begins to fail me—Ah, my Vaunts how vain!How have I ly'd to my own Heart!—Alas!My Tears return, the mighty Flood o'erwhelms me!Ten Thousand crouding Images distractMy tortur'd Thought—And is it come to This?Our Hopes? our Vows? our oft repeated Wishes,Breath'd from the fervent Soul, and full of Heaven,To make each other happy?—come to This!LAURA.If thy own Peace and Honour cannot keepThy Resolution fix'd, yet, SIGISMUNDA,O think, how deeply, how beyond Retreat,Thy Father is engag'd.SIGISMUNDA.Ah wretched Weakness!That thus enthrals my Soul, that chases thenceEach nobler Thought, the Sense of every Duty!—And have I then no Tears for Thee, my Father?Can I forget thy Cares, from helpless Years,Thy Tenderness for me? an Eye still beam'dWith Love? a Brow that never knew a Frown?Nor a harsh Word thy Tongue? Shall I for These,Repay thy stooping venerable Age,With Shame, Disquiet, Anguish and Dishonour?It must not be!—Thou First of Angels! come,Sweet filial Piety! and firm my Breast!Yes, let one Daughter to her Fate submit,Be nobly wretched—but her Father happy!—LAURA!—they come!—O Heavens!

I love you from a Heart,That seeks your Good superior to my own;And will, by every Art of tender Friendship,Consult your dearest Welfare. May I hope,Yours does not disavow your Father's Choice?SIGISMUNDA.I am a Daughter, Sir—and have no PowerO'er my own Heart—I die—Support me, LAURA.[Faints.SIFFREDI.Help!—Bear Her off—She breathes—my Daughter!—SIGISMUNDA.Oh!—Forgive my Weakness—Soft—my LAURA, lead me—To my Apartment.SIFFREDI.Pardon me, my Lord,If by this sudden Accident alarm'd,I leave you for a Moment.SCENE V.OSMOND alone.Let me think—
What can this mean?—Is it to me Aversion?Or is it, as I fear'd, She loves another?Ha!—yes—perhaps the King, the young Count TANCRED!They were bred up together—Surely That,That cannot be—Has he not given his Hand,In the most solemn Manner, to CONSTANTIA?Does not his Crown depend upon the Deed?No—if they lov'd, and this old Statesman knew it,He could not to a King prefer a Subject.His Virtues I esteem—nay more, I trust them—So far as Virtue goes—but could he placeHis Daughter on the Throne of Sicily—O 'tis a glorious Bribe too much for Man!—What is it then?—I care not what it be.My Honour now, my Dignity demands,That my propos'd Alliance, by her FatherAnd even her self accepted, be not scorn'd.I love her too—I never knew till nowTo what a Pitch I lov'd Her. O She shotTen thousand Charms into my inmost Soul!She look'd so mild, so amiably gentle,She bow'd her Head, she glow'd with such Confusion,Such Loveliness of Modesty! She is,In gracious Mind, in Manners, and in Person,The perfect Model of all female Beauty!—She must be mine—She is!—If yet her HeartConsents not to my Happiness, her Duty,Join'd to my tender Cares, will gain so muchUpon her generous Nature—That will follow.The Man of Sense, who acts a prudent Part,Not flattering steals, but forms himself the Heart.ACT IV.SCENE I.The Garden belonging to SIFFREDI's House.SIGISMUNDA, LAURA.SIGISMUNDA, with a Letter in her Hand.'TIS done!—I am a Slave!—The fatal VowHas pass'd my Lips!—Methought in those sad Moments,The Tombs around, the Saints, the darken'd Altar,And all the trembling Shrines with Horror shook.But here is still new Matter of Distress.O TANCRED cease to persecute me more!O grudge me not some calmer State of Woe!Some quiet Gloom to shade my hopeless Days,Where I may never hear of Love and Thee!—Has LAURA too conspir'd against my Peace?Why did you take this Letter?—Bear it back—[Giving her the Letter.I will not court new Pain.LAURA.Madam, RODOLPHOUrg'd me so much, nay, even with Tears conjur'd me,But this once more to serve th' unhappy King—For such He said He was—that tho' enrag'd,Equal with Thee, at his inhuman Falsehood,I could not to my Brother's fervent PrayersRefuse this Office—Read it—His ExcusesWill only more expose his Falsehood.SIGISMUNDA.No.It suits not OSMOND'S Wife to read one LineFrom that contagious Hand—she knows too well!LAURAHe paints him out distress'd beyond Expression,Even on the Point of Madness. Wild as Winds,And fighting Seas, he raves. His Passions mix,With ceaseless Rage, all in each giddy Moment.He dies to see you and to clear his Faith.SIGISMUNDA.Save me from That!—That would be worse than all!LAURA.I but report my Brother's Words; who thenBegan to talk of some dark Imposition,That had deceiv'd us all: when, interrupted,We heard your Father and Earl OSMOND near,As summon'd to CONSTANTIA'S Court they went.SIGISMUNDA.Ha! Imposition?—Well!—If I am doom'dTo be, o'er all my Sex, the Wretch of Love,In vain I would resist—Give me the Letter—To know the worst is some Relief—Alas!It was not thus, with such dire Palpitations,That, TANCRED, once I us'd to read thy Letters.[Attempting to read the Letter, but gives it to LAURA.Ah fond Remembrance blinds me!—Read it, LAURA.LAURA reads.Deliver me, SIGISMUNDA, from that most exquisite Misery which a faithful Heart can suffer—To be thought base by Her, from whose Esteem even Virtue borrows new Charms. When I submitted to my cruel Situation, it was not Falshood you beheld, but an Excess of Love. Rather than endanger That, I for a while gave up my Honour. Every Moment, till I see you, stabs me with severer Pangs than real Guilt itself can feel Let me then conjure You to meet me in the Garden, towards the Close of the

Day, when I will explain this Mystery. We have been most inhumanly abused; and That by the means of the very Paper which I gave you, from the warmest Sincerity of Love, to assure to you the Heart and Hand of TANCRED.SIGISMUNDA.There, LAURA, there, the dreadful Secret sprung!That Paper! ah that Paper! it suggestsA thousand horrid Thoughts—I to my FatherGave it; and He perhaps—I dare not castA Look that way—If yet indeed you love me,O blast me not, kind TANCRED, with the Truth!O pitying keep me ignorant for ever!What strange peculiar Misery is mine?Reduc'd to wish the Man I love were false!Why was I hurry'd to a Step so rash?Repairless Woe!—I might have waited, sure,A few short Hours—No Duty that forbade—I ow'd thy Love that Justice; till this DayThy Love an Image of all-perfect Goodness!A Beam from Heaven that glow'd with every Virtue!And have I thrown this Prize of Life away?The piteous Wreck of one distracted Moment?Ah the cold Prudence of remorseless Age!Ah Parents Traitors to your Children's Bliss!Ah curs'd, ah blind Revenge!—On every handI was betray'd—You, LAURA, too, betray'd me!—LAURA.Who, who, but He, whate'er he writes, betray'd you?Or false or pusillanimous. For once,I will with you suppose, that his AgreementTo the King's Will was forg'd—Tho' forg'd by whom?Your Father scorns the Crime—Yet what avails it?This, if it clears his Truth, condemns his Spirit.A youthful King, by Love and Honour fir'd,Patient to sit on his insulted Throne,And let an Outrage, of so high a Nature,Unpunish'd pass, uncheck'd, uncontradicted—O 'tis a Meanness equal even to Falsehood!SIGISMUNDA.LAURA, no more—We have already judg'dToo largely without Knowledge. Oft, what seemsA Trifle, a meer Nothing, by itself,In some nice Situations, turns the ScaleOf Fate, and rules the most important Actions.Yes, I begin to feel a sad Presage:I am undone, from that eternal SourceOf human Woes—the Judgment of the PassionsBut what have I to do with these Excuses?O cease, my treacherous Heart, to give them room!It suits not Thee to plead a Lover's Cause;Even to lament my Fate is now Dishonour.Nought now remains, but with relentless Purpose,To shun all Interviews, all Clearing upOf this dark Scene; to wrap myself in Gloom,In Solitude and Shades; there to devourThe silent Sorrows ever swelling here;And since I must be wretched—for I must—To claim the mighty Misery myself,Engross it all, and spare a hapless Father.Hence, let me fly!—the Hour approaches—LAURA.Madam,Behold he comes—the King—SIGISMUNDA.Heavens! how escape?No—I will stay—This one last Meeting—Leave meSCENE II.TANCRED, SIGISMUNDA.TANCRED.And are these long long Hours of Torture past?My Life! my SIGISMUNDA![Throwing himself at her Feet.SIGISMUNDA.Rise, my Lord.To see my Sovereign thus no more becomes me.TANCRED.O let me kiss the Ground on which you tread!Let me exhale my Soul in softest Transport!Since I again embrace my SIGISMUNDA![Rising.Unkind! how couldst thou ever deem me false?How thus dishonour Love?—O I could muchEmbitter my Complaint!—How low were thenThy Thoughts of me? How didst thou then affrontThe human Heart itself? After the Vows,The fervent Truth, the tender Protestations,Which mine has often pour'd, to let thy Breast,Whate'er th' Appearance was, admit Suspicion?SIGISMUNDA.How! when I heard myself your full ConsentTo the late King's so just and prudent Will?Heard it before you read, in solemn Senate?When I beheld you give your Royal HandTo Her, whose Birth and Dignity, of Right,Demands that high Alliance? Yes, my Lord,You have done well. The Man, whom Heaven appointsTo govern others, should himself first learnTo bend his Passions to the Sway of Reason.In all you have done well, but when you bidMy humbled Hopes look up to you again,And sooth'd with wanton Cruelty my Weakness—That too was well—My Vanity deserv'dThe sharp Rebuke, whose fond ExtravaganceCould ever dream to balance your Repose,Your Glory and the Welfare of a People.TANCRED.Chide on, chide on. Thy soft Reproaches now,Instead of wounding, only soothe my Fondness.No, no, Thou charming Consort of my Soul!I never lov'd Thee with such faithful Ardor,
As in that cruel miserable MomentYou thought me false; when even my Honour stoop'dTo wear for Thee a baffled Face of Baseness.It was thy barbarous Father, SIGISMUNDA,Who caught me in the Toil. He turn'd that Paper,Meant for th' assuring Bond of Nuptial Love,To ruin it for ever; he, he wroteThat forg'd Consent, you heard, beneath my Name,Nay dar'd before my outrag'd Throne to read it!Had he not been thy Father—Ha! my Love!You tremble, you grow pale.SIGISMUNDA.Oh leave me, TANCRED!TANCRED.No!—Leave thee?—Never! never! till you setMy Heart at peace, till these dear Lips againPronounce Thee mine! Without Thee I renounceMy self, my Friends, the World—Here on this Hand—SIGISMUNDA.My Lord, forget that Hand, which never nowCan be to thine united—TANCRED.SIGISMUNDA!What dost Thou mean? Thy Words, thy Look, thy Manner,Seem to conceal some horrid Secret—Heavens!—No—That was wild—Distraction fires that Thought!SIGISMUNDA.Enquire no more—I never can be thine.TANCRED.What, who shall interpose? who dares attemptTo brave the Fury of an injur'd King?Who, ere he sees Thee ravish'd from his Hopes,Will wrap all blazing Sicily in Flames—SIGISMUNDA.In vain your Power, my Lord—This fatal Error,Join'd to my Father's unrelenting Will,
Has plac'd an everlasting Bar betwixt Us—I am—Earl OSMOND'S—Wife.TANCRED.Earl OSMOND'S Wife!—[After a long Pause, during which they look at one another with the highest Agitation and most tender Distress.Heavens! did I hear thee right? what! marry'd? marry'd!Lost to thy faithful TANCRED! lost for ever!Couldst thou then doom me to such matchless Woe,Without so much as hearing me?—Distraction!—Alas! what hast thou done? Ah SIGISMUNDA!Thy rash Credulity has done a Deed,Which of two happiest Lovers—that e'er feltThe blissful Power, has made two finish'd Wretches!But—Madness!—Sure, Thou knowst it cannot be!This Hand is mine! a thousand thousand Vows—SCENE III.TANCRED.

Treason against my Love!—Thy Life shall answer for it!OSMOND.Ha! my Life!—It moves my Scorn to hear thy empty Threats.When was it that a Norman Baron's LifeBecame so vile, as on the Frown of KingsTo hang?—Of That thy Lord the Law must judge:Or if the Law be weak, my Guardian Sword—TANCRED.Dare not to touch it, Traitor! lest my RageBreak loose, and do a Deed that misbecomes me.SCENE IV.TANCRED.

The Duties of my StationAre not to me unknown—But Thou, old Man,Dost Thou not blush to talk of Rights invaded?And of our best our dearest Bliss disturb'd?Thou! who with more than barbarous PerfidyHast trampled all Allegiance, Justice, Truth,Humanity itself, beneath thy Feet?Thou knowest Thou hast—I could, to thy Confusion,Return thy hard Reproaches; but I spare TheeBefore this Lord, for whose ill-sorted Friendship,Thou hast most basely sacrific'd thy Daughter.Farewel, my Lord!—For Thee, Lord Constable,
Who dost presume to lift thy surly EyeTo my soft Love, my gentle SIGISMUNDA,I once again command Thee, on thy Life—Yes—chew thy Rage—but mark me—on thy Life,No further urge thy arrogant Pretensions!SCENE V.SIFFREDI. OSMOND.OSMOND.Ha! arrogant Pretensions! Heaven and Earth!What! arrogant Pretensions to my Wife?My wedded Wife! Where are we? In a LandOf Civil Rule, of Liberty and Laws?—Not on my Life pursue them?—Giddy Prince!My Life disdains thy Nod. It is the GiftOf parent Heaven, who gave me too an Arm,A Spirit to defend it against Tyrants.The Norman Race, the Sons of mighty ROLLO,Who rushing in a Tempest from the North,Great Nurse of generous Freemen! bravely wonWith their own Swords their Seats, and still possess themBy the same noble Tenure, are not us'dTo hear such Language—If I now desist,Then brand me for a Coward! deem me Villain!A Traitor to the Publick! By this ConductDeceiv'd, betray'd, insulted, tyranniz'd.Mine is a common Cause. My Arm shall guard,Mix'd with my own, the Rights of each Sicilian,Of social Life, and of Mankind in general.Ere to thy Tyrant Rage they fall a Prey,I shall find Means to shake thy tottering Throne,Which this illegal this perfidious UsageForfeits at once, and crush thee in the Ruins!—CONSTANTIA is my Queen!SIFFREDI.Lord Constable,Let us be stedfast in the Right; but let usAct with cool Prudence, and with manly Temper,As well as manly Firmness. True, I own,Th' Indignities you suffer are so high,As might even justify what now you threaten.But if, my Lord, we can prevent the WoesThe cruel Horrors of intestine War,Yet hold untouch'd our Liberties and Laws;O let us, rais'd above the turbid SphereOf little selfish Passions, nobly do it!Nor to our hot intemperate Pride pour outA dire Libation of Sicilian Blood.'Tis Godlike Magnanimity, to keep,When most provok'd, our Reason calm and clear,And execute her Will, from a strong SenseOf what is right, without the vulgar AidOf Heat and Passion, which, tho' honest, bear usOften too far. Remember that my HouseProtects my Daughter still; and ere I saw herThus ravish'd from us, by the Arm of Power,This Hand should act the Roman Father's Part.Fear not; be temperate; all will yet be well.I know the King. At first his Passions burstQuick as the Lightning's Flash: but in his BreastHonour and Justice dwell—Trust me, to ReasonHe will return.OSMOND.He will!—By Heavens, he shall!—You know the King—I wish, my Lord SIFFREDI,That you had deign'd to tell me all you knew—And would you have me wait, with duteous Patience,Till he return to Reason? Ye just Powers!When he has planted on our Necks his Foot,And trod us into Slaves; when his vain PrideIs cloy'd with our Submission; if, at last,He finds his Arm too weak, to shake the Frame
Of wide-establish'd Order out of Joint,And overturn all Justice; then, perchance,He, in a Fit of sickly kind Repentance,May make a Merit to return to Reason.No, no, my Lord!—There is a nobler WayTo teach the blind oppressive Fury Reason:Oft has the Lustre of avenging SteelUnseal'd her stupid Eyes—The Sword is Reason!SCENE VI.SIFFREDI. OSMOND. RODOLPHO, (with Guards.RODOLPHO.My Lord High Constable of Sicily,In the King's Name, and by his special Order,I here arrest you Prisoner of State.OSMOND.What King?

Farewel, my Lord—More than my Life and Fortune,Remember well, is in your Hands—my Honour!SIFFREDI.Our Honour is the same. My Son, farewel—We shall not long be parted. On these EyesSleep shall not shed his Balm, till I behold TheeRestor'd to Freedom, or partake thy Bonds.Even noble Courage is not void of Blame,Till nobler Patience sanctifies its Flame.ACT V.SCENE I.SIFFREDI, alone.THE Prospect lowrs around. I found the King,Tho' calm'd a little, with subsiding Tempest,As suits his generous Nature, yet in LoveAbated nought, most ardent in his Purpose;Inexorably fix'd, whate'er the Risque,To claim my Daughter, and dissolve this Marriage—I have embark'd, upon a perillous Sea,A mighty Treasure. Here, the rapid YouthTh' impetuous Passions of a Lover-KingCheck my bold Course; and there, the jealous PrideTh'impatient Honour of a haughty Lord,Of the first Rank, in Interest and DependantsNear equal to the King, forbid Retreat.My Honour too, the same unchang'd Conviction,That these my Measures were, and still remainOf absolute Necessity, to saveThe Land from Civil Fury, urge me on.
But how proceed?—I only faster rushUpon the desperate Evils I would shun.Whate'er the Motive be, Deceit, I fear,And harsh unnatural Force are not the MeansOf Publick Welfare or of Private Bliss—Bear Witness, HEAVEN! Thou Mind-inspecting Eye!My Breast is pure. I have preferr'd my Duty,The Good and Safety of my Fellow-Subjects,To all those Views that fire the selfish RaceOf Men, and mix them in eternal Broils.Enter an Officer belonging to SIFFREDI.OFFICER.My Lord, a Man of noble Port, his FaceWrap'd in Disguise, is earnest for Admission.SIFFREDI.Go, bid him enter—[Officer goes out.Ha wrap'd in Disguise!And at this late unseasonable Hour!When o'er the World tremendous Midnight reigns,By the dire Gloom of raging Tempest doubled—SCENE II.SIFFREDI. OSMOND, discovering himself.SIFFREDI.What! Ha! Earl OSMOND, you?—Welcome, once more,To this glad Roof!—But why in this Disguise?Would I could hope the King exceeds his Promise!I have his Faith soon as To-morrow's Sun
Shall gild Sicilia's Cliffs, you should be free.—Has some good Angel turn'd his Heart to Justice?OSMOND.It is not by the Favour of Count TANCREDThat I am here. As much I scorn his Favour,As I defy his Tyranny and Threats—Our Friend GOFFREDO, who commands the Castle,On my Parole, ere Dawn, to render backMy Person, has permitted me this Freedom.Know then, the faithless Outrage of To-day,By him committed whom you call the King,Has rouz'd CONSTANTIA'S Court. Our Friends, the FriendsOf Virtue, Justice, and of Publick Faith,Ripe for Revolt, are in high Ferment all.This, this, they say, exceeds whate'er deform'dThe miserable Days we saw beneathWILLIAM the Bad. This saps the solid Base,At once, of Government and private Life;This shameless Imposition on the Faith,The Majesty of Senates, this lewd Insult,This Violation of the Rights of Men.Added to These, his ignominious TreatmentOf Her th'illustrious Offspring of our Kings,Sicilia's Hope, and now our Royal Mistress.You know, my Lord, how grossly These infringeThe late King's Will; which orders, if Count TANCREDMake not CONSTANTIA Partner of his Throne,That He be quite excluded the Succession,And She to HENRY given, King of the Romans,The potent Emperor BARBEROSSA'S Son,Who seeks with earnest Instance her Alliance.I thence of You, as Guardian of the Laws,As Guardian of this Will to you entrusted,Desire, nay more, demand, your instant Aid,To see it put in vigorous Execution.SIFFREDI.You cannot doubt, my Lord, of my Concurrence.
Who more than I have labour'd this great Point?'Tis my own Plan. And, if I drop it now,I should be justly branded with the shameOf rash Advice, or despicable Weakness.But let us not precipitate the Matter.CONSTANTIA'S Friends are numerous and strong;Yet TANCRED'S, trust me, are of equal Force.E'er since the Secret of his Birth was known,The People all are in a Tumult hurl'dOf boundless Joy, to hear there lives a PrinceOf mighty GUISCARD'S Line. Numbers, besides,Of powerful Barons, who at heart had pin'd,To see the Reign of their renown'd Forefathers,Won by immortal Deeds of matchless Valour,Pass from the gallant Normans to the Suevi,Will, with a kind of rage, espouse his Cause—'Tis so my Lord—be not by Passion blinded—'Tis surely so—O if our prating VertueDwells not in Words alone—O let us join,My generous OSMOND, to avert these Woes,And yet sustain our tottering Norman Kingdom!OSMOND.But how, SIFFREDI? how?—If by soft MeansWe can maintain our Rights, and save our Country,May his unnatural Blood first stain the Sword,Who with unpitying Fury first shall bare it!SIFFREDI.I have a Thought—The glorious Work be thine.But it requires an awful Flight of Virtue,Above the Passions of the vulgar Breast,And thence from thee I hope it, noble OSMOND—Suppose my Daughter, to her GOD devoted,Were plac'd within some Convent's sacred Verge,Beneath the dread Protection of the Altar—OSMOND.Ere Then, by Heavens! I would devoutly shaveMy holy Scalp, turn whining Monk myself,And pray incessant for the Tyrant's Safety!—
What! How! because an insolent Invader,A Sacrilegious Tyrant, in ContemptOf all those noblest Rights, which to maintainIs Man's peculiar Pride, demands my Wife;That I shall thus betray the Common CauseOf Human kind, and tamely yield Her up,Even in the Manner you propose—O thenI were supremely vile! degraded! sham'd!The Scorn of Manhood! and abhor'd of Honour!SIFFREDI.There is, my Lord, an Honour, the calm ChildOf Reason, of Humanity and Mercy,Superior far to this punctilious Demon,That singly minds it self, and oft embroilsWith proud barbarian Niceties the World!OSMOND.My Lord, my Lord!—I cannot brooke your Prudence—It holds a Pulse unequal to my Blood—Unblemish'd Honour is the Flower of Virtue!The vivifying Soul! and He who slights itWill leave the other dull and lifeless Dross.SIFFREDI.No more—You are too warm.OSMOND.You are too cool.SIFFREDI.Too cool, my Lord? I were indeed too cool,Not to resent this Language, and to tell Thee—I wish Earl OSMOND were as cool as ITo his own Selfish Bliss—ay, and as warmTo That of Others—But of This no more—My Daughter is thy Wife—I gave her to Thee,And will against all Force maintain her Thine.But think not I will catch thy headlong Passions,Whirl'd in a Blaze of Madness o'er the Land;Or, till the last Extremity compel me,
Risque the dire Means of War—The King, Tomorrow,Will set you free; and, if by gentle MeansHe does not yield my Daughter to thy Arms,And wed CONSTANTIA, as the Will requires,Why then expect me on the Side of Justice—Let that suffice.OSMOND.It does—Forgive my Heat.My rankled Mind, by Injuries inflam'd,May be too prompt to take and give Offence.SIFFREDI.'Tis pass'd—Your Wrongs, I own, may well transportThe wisest Mind—But henceforth, noble OSMOND,Do me more Justice, honour more my Truth,Nor mark me with an Eye of squint Suspicion—These Jars apart—You may repose your SoulOn my firm Faith and unremitting Friendship.Of That I sure have given exalted Proof,And the next Sun, we see, shall prove it further—Return, my Son, and from your Friend GOFFREDORelease your Word. There try, by soft Repose,To calm your Breast.OSMOND.Bid the vext Ocean sleep,Swept by the Pinions of the raging North—But your frail Age, by Care and Toil exhausted,Demands the Balm of all-repairing Rest.SIFFREDI.Soon as To-morrow's Dawn shall streak the Skies,I, with my Friends in solemn State assembled,Will to the Palace and demand your Freedom.Then by calm Reason, or by higher Means,The King shall quit his Claim, and in the FaceOf Sicily, my Daughter shall be yours.Farewel.OSMOND.My Lord, good-night.SCENE III.OSMOND alone.[After a long Pause.I like him not—Yes—I have mighty Matter of Suspicion.'Tis plain—I see it—Lurking in his Breast,He has a foolish Fondness for this King—My Honour is not safe, while here my WifeRemains—Who knows but he this very NightMay bear Her to some Convent as he mention'd—The King too—tho' I smother'd up my Rage,I mark'd it well—will set me free To-morrow.Why not To-night? He has some dark Design—By Heavens! he has—I am abus'd most grosly;Made the vile Tool of this old Statesman's Schemes;Marry'd to One—Ay, and he knew it—OneWho loves young TANCRED! Hence her swooning, Tears,And all her soft Distress, when she disgrac'd meBy basely giving her perfidious HandWithout her Heart—Hell and Perdition! This,This is the Perfidy! This is the fell,The keen, envenom'd, exquisite Disgrace!Which to a Man of Honour even exceedsThe Falshood of the Person—But I nowWill rouze me from the poor tame Lethargy,By my believing Fondness cast upon Me.I will not wait his crawling timid Motions,Perhaps to blind me meant, which he To-morrowHas promis'd to pursue. No! ere his EyesShall open on To-morrow's orient Beam,I will convince him that Earl OSMOND neverWas form'd to be his Dupe—I know full wellTh' important Weight and Danger of the Deed:
But to a Man, whom greater Dangers press,Driven to the Brink of Infamy and Horror,Rashness itself, and utter Desperation,Are the best Prudence—I will bear Her offThis Night, and lodge Her in a Place of Safety.I have a trusty Band that waits not far.Hence! Let me lose no Time—One rapid MomentShould ardent form, at once, and executeA bold Design—'Tis fix'd—'Tis done!—Yes, then,When I have seiz'd the Prize of Love and Honour,And with a Friend secur'd Her; to the CastleI will repair, and claim GOFFREDO'S PromiseTo rise with all his Garrison—My FriendsWith brave Impatience wait. The Mine is laid,And only wants my kindling Touch to spring.SCENE IV.SIGISMUNDA'S Apartment.SIGISMUNDA. LAURA.LAURA.Heavens! 'tis a fearful Night!SIGISMUNDA.Ah! the black RagOf midnight Tempest, or th' assuring SmilesOf radiant Morn are equal all to me.Nought now has Charms or Terrors to my Breast,The Seat of stupid Woe!—Leave me, my LAURA.Kind Rest, perhaps, may hush my Woes a little—Oh for that quiet Sleep that knows no Morning!LAURA.Madam, indeed I know not how to go.Indulge my Fondness—Let me watch a whileBy your sad Bed, till these dread Hours shall pass.SIGISMUNDA.Alas! what is the Toil of Elements,This idle Perturbation of the Sky,To what I feel within—Oh that the FiresOf pitying Heaven would point there Fury here!Goodnight, my dearest LAURA!LAURA.Oh I know notWhat this Oppression means—but 'tis with pain,With Tears, I can persuade myself to leave you—Well then—Goodnight, my dearest SIGISMUNDA!SCENE V.SIGISMUNDA.And am I then alone?—The most undone,Most wretched Being, now beneath the CopeOf this affrighting Gloom that wraps the World!—I said I did not fear—Ah me! I feelA shivering Horror run thro' all my Powers,O I am nought but Tumult, Fears and Weakness!And yet how idle Fear when Hope is gone,Gone, gone forever!—O Thou gentle Scene [Looking towards her Bed.Of sweet Repose, where by th' oblivious Draught,Of each sad toilsome Day, to Peace restor'd,Unhappy Mortals lose their Woes awhile,Thou hast no Peace for me!—What shall I do?How pass this dreadful Night, so big with Terror?—Here, with the Midnight Shades, here will I sit, [sitting down.A Prey to dire Despair, and ceaseless weepThe Hours away—Bless me!—I heard a Noise—[starting up.No—I mistook—Nothing but Silence reignsAnd awful Midnight round—Again!—O Heavens!My Lord the King!SCENE VI.TANCRED. SIGISMUNDA.TANCRED.Be not allarm'd, my Love!SIGISMUNDA.My Royal Lord! why at this Midnight Hour,How came you hither?TANCRED.By that secret WayMy Love contriv'd, when We, in happier Days,Us'd to devote these Hours, so much in vain,To Vows of Love and everlasting Friendship.SIGISMUNDA.Why will you thus persist to add new StingsTo her Distress, who never can be thine?O ly me! fly! You know—TANCRED.I know too much.O how I could reproach Thee, SIGISMUNDA!Pour out my injur'd Soul in just Complaints!But now the Time permits not, These swift Moments.—I told thee how thy Father's ArtisiceForc'd me to seem perfidious in thy Eyes.Ah, fatal Blindness! not to have observ'dThe mingled Pangs of Rage and Love that shook me;When, by my cruel Publick SituationCompell'd, I only feign'd Consent, to gainA little Time, and more secure Thee mine.E'er since—A dreadful Interval of Care!—My Thoughts have been employ'd, not without Hope,How to defeat SIFFREDI'S barbarous Purpose.
But thy Credulity has ruin'd all,Thy rash, thy wild—I know not what to name it—Oh it has prov'd the giddy Hopes of ManTo be Delusion all, and sickening Folly!SIGISMUNDA.Ah, generous TANCRED! ah thy Truth destroys me!Yes, yes, 'tis I, 'tis I alone am false!My hasty Rage, join'd to my tame Submission,More than the most exalted filial DutyCould e'er demand, has dash'd our Cup of FateWith Bitterness unequal'd—But, alas!What are thy Woes to mine?—to mine! just Heaven!—Now is thy Turn of Vengeance—hate, renounce me!O leave me to the Fate I well deserve,To sink in hopeless Misery!—at least,Try to forget the worthless SIGISMUNDA!TANCRED.Forget Thee! No! Thou art my Soul itself!I have no Thought, no Hope, no Wish but Thee!Even this repented Injury; the Fears,That rouze me all to Madness, at the ThoughtOf losing Thee; the whole collected PainsO my full Heart, serve but to make thee dearer!Ah, how forget Thee!—Much must be forgotEre TANCRED can forget his SIGISMUNDA!SIGISMUNDA.But you, my Lord, must make that great Effort.TANCRED.Can SIGISMUNDA make it?SIGISMUNDA.Ah! I know notWith what Success—But all that feeble WomanAnd Love-entangled Reason can perform,I, to the utmost, will exert to do it.TANCRED.Fear not—'Tis done!—If thou canst form the Thought,Success is sure—I am forgot already!SIGISMUNDA.Ah TANCRED!—But, my Lord, respect me more.Think who I am—What can you now propose?TANCRED.To claim the plighted Vows which Heaven has heard,To vindicate the Rights of holy Love,By Faith and Honour bound, to which compar'dThese empty Forms, which have ensnar'd thy Hand,Are impious Guile, Abuse, and Profanation—Nay, as a King, whose high PrerogativeBy this unlicens'd Marriage is affronted,To bid the Laws themselves pronounce it void.SIGISMUNDA.Honour, my Lord, is much too proud to catchAt every slender Twig of nice Distinctions.These for th' unfeeling Vulgar may do well:But Those, whose Souls are by the nicer RuleOf virtuous Delicacy nobly sway'd,Stand at another Bar than that of Laws.Then cease to urge me—Since I am not bornTo that exalted Fate to be your Queen—Or, yet a dearer Name—to be your Wife!—I am the Wife of an illustrious Lord,Of your own princely Blood; and what I am,I will with proper Dignity remain.Retire, my Royal Lord—There is no MeansTo cure the Wounds this fatal Day has given.We meet no more!TANCRED.Oh barbarous SIGISMUNDA!And canst Thou talk thus steadily? thus treat meWith such unpitying, unrelenting Rigour?Poor is the Love, that rather than give upA little Pride, a little formal Pride,The Breath of Vanity! can bear to seeThe Man, whose Heart was once so dear to thine▪

I dare not give him my Assistance;My Care would only more enflame his Rage.Behold the fatal Work of my dark Hand,That by rude Force the Passions would command,That ruthless sought to root them from the Breast;They may be rul'd, but will not be opprest.Taught hence, Ye Parents, who from Nature stray,And the great Ties of social Life betray;Ne'er with your Children act a Tyrant's Part:'Tis your's to guide, not violate the Heart.Ye vainly wise, who o'er Mankind preside,Behold my righteous Woes, and drop your Pride!Keep Virtue's simple Path before your Eyes,Nor think from Evil Good can ever rise.The END.EPILOGUE.Spoken by MISS BUDGELL.CRamm'd to the Throat with wholesome moral Stuff,Alas! poor Audience! you have had enough.Was ever hapless Heroine of a PlayIn such a piteous Plight as ours To-day?Was ever Woman so by Love betray'd?Match'd with two Husbands, and yet—die a Maid.But bless me!—hold—What Sounds are these I hear!—I see the TRAGIC MUSE herself appear.The Back-Scene opens, and discovers a romantic Silvan Landskip; from which Mrs. CIBBER, in the Character of the TRAGIC MUSE, advances slowly to Musick, and speaks the following Lines.Hence with your flippant Epilogue, that triesTo wipe the virtuous Tear from BRITISH Eyes;That dares my moral Tragic Scene profane,With Strains—at best, unsuiting, light and vain.Hence from the pure unsully'd Beams that playIn yon fair Eyes, where Virtue shines—Away!BRITONS, to you from chaste Castalian Groves,Where dwell the tender, oft unhappy Loves;Where Shades of Heroes roam, each mighty Name,And court my Aid to rise again to Fame;To you I come, to Freedom's noblest Seat,And in BRITANNIA fix my last Retreat.In GREECE, and ROME, I watch'd the Publick Weal;The purple Tyrant trembled at my Steel:Nor did I less o'er private Sorrows reign,And mend the melting Heart with softer Pain.On FRANCE and YOU then rose my brightning Star,With social Ray—The ARTS are ne'er at War.O as your Fire and Genius stronger blaze,As yours are generous Freedom's bolder Lays,Let not the Gallick Taste leave yours behind,In decent Manners and in Life refin'd;Banish the motley Mode, to tag low Verse,The laughing Ballad to the mournful Herse.When thro' five Acts your Hearts have learnt to glow,Touch'd with the sacred Force of honest Woe;O keep the dear Impression on your Breast,Nor idly lose it for a wretched Jest!
