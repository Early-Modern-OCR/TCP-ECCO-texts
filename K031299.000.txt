BOADICIA. A TRAGEDY. As it is acted at the THEATRE-ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE. By Mr. GLOVER.LONDON: Printed for R. and J. DODSLEY in Pall-mall; and M. COOPER in Pater-noster-row. 1753.(Price One Shilling and Six-pence.)PROLOGUE.Spoken by Mr. MOSSOP.BESIDE his native Thames our poet longHath hung his silent harp, and hush'd his song.Kind Commerce whisper'd. "See my blissful state,"And to no smiles but mine resign thy fate."Beneath the pregnant branches rest awhile,"Which by my culture spread this favour'd isle;"On that fair tree the fruits of ev'ry coost,"All, which the Ganges and the Volga boast,"All, which the sun's luxuriant beam supplies,"Or slowly ripens under frozen skies,"In mix'd variety of growth arise."The copious leaves beneficence diffuse,"Which on affliction drops restoring dews,"And birds of hope among the loaded sprays"Tune with enchantment their alluring lays"To cheer despondence and th' inactive raise."Rest here, she cry'd, and smiling time again"May string thy lyre, and I approve the strain."At length his muse from exile he recalls,Urg'd by his patrons in Augusta's walls.Those gen'rous traders, who alike sustainTheir nation's glory on th' obedient main,And bounteous raise affliction's drooping train.They, who benignant to his toils affordTheir shelt'ring favour, have his muse restor'd.They in her future fame will justly share,But her disgrace herself must singly bear;
Calm bours of learned leisure they have giv'n,And could no more, for genius is from heav'n.To open now her long-hid roll she tries,When vary'd forms of pictur'd passions rise.Revenge and pride their furies first unfold,By artless virtue fatally controll'd.Scenes wrought with gentler pencils then succeed,Where love persuades a faithful wife to bleed;Where, join'd to publick cares, domestic woeIs seen from manly fortitude to flow.But if her colours mock the candid eyeBy spurious tincts, unmix'd with nature's dye,Ye friendly hands, restrain your fruitless aid,And with just censure let her labours fade.Dramatis personae.DUMNORIX byMr. GARRICK.TENANTIUSMr. BURTON.EBRANCUSMr. MOZEEN.FLAMINIUSMr. HAVARD.AENOBARBUSMr. MOSSOP.BOADICIAMrs. PRITCHARE.VENUSIAMrs. CIBBER.ROMAN AMBASSADOR, ICENIANS, and TRINOBANTIANS.SCENE, the British camp before the tent of Dumnorix.BOADICIA.ACT I.SCENE the First.BOADICIA, DUMNORIX, ICENIANS, TRINOBANTIANS and ROMAN Ambassadors.ROMAN Ambassador.SUETONIUS, leader of the Roman arms,With gentlest greetings to th' Icenian queen,And Dumnorix, the Trinobantian chief,Sends health, and proffers friendship. Let the wrongs,The mutual wrongs sustain'd by Rome and Britain—BOADICIA.May stern Andate, war's victorious goddess,Again resign me to your impious rage,If e'er I blot my suff'rings from remembrance;If e'er relenting mercy cool my vengeance,Till I have driv'n you to our utmost shores,And cast your legions on the crimson'd beach.Your costly dwellings shall be sunk in ashes,Your fields be ravag'd, your aspiring bulwarks
O'erturn'd and levell'd to the meanest shrub;Your gasping matrons, and your children's bloodWith mingled streams shall dye the British sword;Your captive warriors, victims at our altars,Shall croud each temple's spacious round with death:Else may each pow'r, to whom the Druids bend,Annul my hopes of conquest and revenge!DUMNORIXto the Ambassador.You come to offer terms. Stand forth and answer.Did not Prasutagus, her dying lord,On your insatiate emperor bestowHalf of his rich possessions, vainly deeming,The rest might pass unpillag'd to his children?What did you then, ye savage sons of rapine?You seiz'd the whole inheritance by force,Laid waste our cities, with the servile scourgeDisgrac'd a royal matron; you deflow'r'dHer spotless daughters, stole our noblest youthTo serve your pride and luxury in Rome;Our priests you butcher'd, and our hoary elders,Profan'd our altars, our religious groves,And the base-image of your Caesar thrustAmong the gods of Britain: and by heav'nDo you repair to these victorious tentsWith proffer'd peace and friendship?ROMAN Ambassador.Yes, to treat,As faith, benevolence and justice dictate.DUMNORIX.How shall we treat with those, whose impious handsHave rent the sacred bands of mutual trust?How shall we treat with those, whose stony heartsCompassion cannot melt, nor shame controll,Nor justice awe, nor piety restrain,Nor kindness win, nor gratitude can bind?ROMAN Ambossador.Thou art a stranger to our gen'ral's virtues.
No pillager, like Catus, but a soldier,To calm and sober discipline inur'd,He would redress, not widen your complaints.DUMNORIX.Can he restore the violated maidTo her untainted purity and fame?Can he persuade inexorable deathTo yield our slaughter'd elders from the grave?No, nor by soothing tales elude our vengeance.ROMAN Ambassador.Yet hear us calmly, e'er from yonder hillsYou call the legions of imperial Rome,And wake her eagles, which would sleep in peace.BOADICIA.Begone, and bear defiance to your legions.Tell them, I come, that Boadicia comes,Fierce with her wrongs, and terrible in vengeance,To roll her chariot o'er their firmest ranks,To mix their soaring eagles with the dust,And spurn their pride beneath her horses hoofs.ROMAN Ambassador.Then be prepar'd for war.BOADICIA.We are prepar'd.Come from your hills, ye fugitive remainsOf shatter'd cohorts by their fear preserv'd.Th' embattled nations of our peopled isle,Yet fresh from sev'nty thousand slaughter'd Romans,Shall add yon refuse to the purple heap.And yet amid triumphant desolation,Though flames each Roman colony devour,Though each distracted matron view her infantGrasp with its tender hands the piercing spear,Though your grey fathers to the falchion's edgeEach feeble head surrender, my revengeWill pine unsated, and my greatness wantRedress proportion'd to a queen's disgrace.DUMNORIX.Go, and report this answer to Suetonius.Too long have parents sighs, the cries of orphans,And tears of widows, signalized your sway,Since your ambitious Julius first advanc'dHis murd'rous standard on our peaceful shores.At length unfetter'd from his patient sloth,The British genius lifts his pond'rous handsTo hurl with ruin his collected wrathFor all the wrongs, a century hath borne,In one black period on the Roman race.ROMAN Ambassador.Yet e're we part, your price of ransom nameFor the two captive Romans.BOADICIA.Not the wealth,Which loads the palaces of sumptuous Rome,Shall bribe my fury. Hence, and tell your legions,The hungry ravens, which inhabit roundThe chalky cliffs of Albion, shall assembleTo feast upon the limbs of these, your captains,Shall riot in the gore of Roman chiefs,These Masters of the World. Produce the pris'ners.[To an Icenian.SCENE the Second.BOADICIA, DUMNORIX, ICENIANS, TRINOBANTIANS, ROMAN AMBASSADORS, AENOBARBUS, and FLAMINIUS in Chains.BOADICIAto the Ambassador.Stay, if thou will't, and see our victims fall.AENOBARBUSto BOADICIA.Dart not on me thy fiery eyes, barbarian.Vain are thy efforts to dismay a Roman.Life is become unworthy of my care;
And these vile limbs, by galling chains dishonour'd,I give most freely to the wolves and thee,ROMAN Ambassador.Mistaken queen, the Romans do not wantThese instigations, nor thy proud defianceTo meet your numbers in the vale below.AENOBARBUSto the Ambassador.Then wherefore do'st thou linger here in vain.Commend us to Suetonius; bid him streightArrange his conquering legions in the field,There teach these rash barbarians to repentOf their disdain, and wish for peace too late.ROMAN Ambassador to AENOBARBUS and FLAMINIUS.Yes, to Suetonius and the Roman campThese heavy commendations will we bear;That for two gallant countrymen our love,And indignation at their fate may sharpenEach weapon's point, and strengthen ev'ry nerve,Till humbled Britain have appeas'd their shades.SCENE the Third.BOADICIA, DUMNORIX, ICENIANS, TRINOBANTIANS, AENOBARBUS and FLAMINIUS.AENOBARBUS.Come, let us know our fate.BOADICIA.Prepare for Death.AENOBARBUS.Then cease to loiter, savage.DUMNORIXto AENOBARBUS.Now by heav'nWert thou no Roman, I could save and love thee.That dauntless spirit in another breast,And in a blameless cause were truly noble;But shews in thee the murderer and ruffian.AENOBARBUS.Thy hate, or favour are alike to me.FLAMINIUSto DUMNORIX.May I demand, illustrious Trinobantian,Why must we fall, because uncertain warHath made us captives.DUMNORIX.If in open battleWith gen'rous valour to have fac'd our armsWere all our charge against thee, thou mightst restSecure of life; but leading thee to dieIs execution on a gen'ral robber.AENOBARBUSto FLAMINIUS.And dost thou meanly sue to these barbarians?FLAMINIUSto DUMNORIX.Though our rapacious countrymen have drawnYour just resentment, we are guiltless borh.BOADICIAto FLAMINIUS.So are ten thousand infants, whom the name,The single name of Roman shall condemn,Like thee, to perish by th' unsparing sword.FLAMINIUS.Yet more than guiltless, we may plead desertWith Boadicia.BOADICIA.Insolent pretension!A Roman plead desert with Boadicia!This shall enlarge the portion of thy suff'rings;For this not only shall thy blood embrueAndate's shrine but torture shall be added,And fury wanton in thy various pains.AENOBARBUSto BOADICIA.Produce thy tortures, them and thee we scorn.TENANTIUSto the TRINOBANTIANS.Fall back with rev'rence, Trinobantian soldiers.See, who advances from your gen'ral's tent.SCENE the Fourth.BOADICIA, DUMNORIX, ICENIANS, TRINOBANTIANS, AENOBARBUS, FLAMINIUS, and VENUSIA.VENUSIA.Victorious sister, may th' unresting labourOf fortune weave new honours to adorn thee,And Dumnorix, thy colleague, and my lord;But if amid these warlike consultations,Ere yet the order'd pomp of battle moves,A supplicating sound may reach thy ear,Stoop from thy glory to an act of mercy.Thy doom pronounc'd on these unhappy captives—BOADICIA.Ha!VENUSIA.Their deservings, and thy daughter's pray'r,Mix'd with my own compassion, from the tentHave call'd me forth a suitor to thy pity,That thou would'st hear and spare them.BOADICIA.Spare these captives?DUMNORIX.Why this request, Venusia?VENUSIA.Give them hearing.They can unfold a story, which demandsYour whole attention.DUMNORIX.Let us hear. Proceed.[To Flam.FLAMINIUS.The Romans' late injustice we abhorr'd,Nor join'd the band of spoilers. In that seasonWe chanc'd one day to wander through the forest,Which parts our confines from th' Icenian land.
We found a beauteous virgin in our way.BGADICIA.Wretch, dost thou hope to barter with our sisterFor thy base life?FLAMINIUS.I fear not death, O queen;But dread dishonour ev'n among my foes.AENOBARBUSto FLAMINIUS.Death is thy terrour; reason else would teach thee,No gratitude with cruelty can dwell.FLAMINIUS.Deep in that wood we met the lovely maid,Chac'd by a brutal soldier. At our threatsHe soon retreated. To our home we led her,From insult guarded, sent her back with honour,Nor was she less than Boadicia's daughter.VENUSIA.Now, dearest sister, whose successful standardNot valour more, than equity upholds;And thou, my husband, who dost rise in armsOppressive deeds in others to chastise;From your own guiding justice will you stray,And blend deservers with the herd of guilt?DUMNORIX.And are you Romans? Yes, we will, Venusia,Repay their worthy deed. Strike off their fetters.BOADICIA.What do I hear? A British chief's command?Whoe'er unchains a Roman, on mankindLets loose oppression, insolence and rapine;Sets treason, falshood, vice, and murder free.VENUSIA.Yet these preserv'd thy Emmeline from shame.BOADICIA.Not less the victim of eternal shame,Was she conducted to their hateful mansion;To guard her honour, and be less, than ruffians,
Had been repugnant to their name and race;But fear of me compell'd them to release her.Then shall two Romans nurs'd in fraud and falshood,From childhood train'd to each flagitious deed,By colour'd pleas to shun the fate, they merit,Here find regard against the thousand mouthsOf Boadicia's suff'rings? No, this momentShall they expire in torture.VENUSIA.Yet reflect,Of all the paths, which lead to human bliss,The most secure and grateful to our stepsWith mercy and humanity is mark'd.The sweet-tongu'd rumour of a gracious deedCan charm from hostile hands th' uplifted blade,The gall of anger into milk transform,And dress the brows of enmity in smiles.BOADICIA.Still dost thou dare, Venusia—.DUMNORIX.Gently, sister.And trust me, these resemble virtuous men.BOADICIA.Was not I virtuous, whom the Romans lash'd?Were not my violated children virtuous?Bear them this instant to the fiercest rack;And while their trembling limbs are strain'd with torture,While thro' the cruel agony of painThe bloody drops bedew their shiv'ring cheeks,Tell them, how gentle are the pangs, they feelTo those the soul of Boadicia prov'd,When Roman rage her naked limbs expos'd▪And mark'd her flesh with ever-during shame.DUMNORIXto the Britons.Withhold your Hands.BOADICIA.What means the Trinobantian?DUMNORIX.To save thy benefactors and proclaim,Whate'er by valour we extort from fortune,We yet deserve by justice.BOADICIA.To contendWith Boadicia, and protect her foesDid she awaken thy ignoble sloth,Which else without resentment of thy wrongsHad slept obscure at home.DUMNORIX.Forbear. Be calm.BOADICIA.Yes, under bondage thou hadst tamely bow'd,Had not I fir'd thy slow, inactive soul.DUMNORIX.Not with unbridled passion I confess,I wield the sword and mount the warlike car.With careful eyes I view'd our suff'ring isle,And meditated calmly to avenge her.Unmov'd by rage, my soul maintains her purposeThrough one unalter'd course; and oft beforeAs I have guided thy unruly spirit,Against its wildness will I now protect thee,And from a base, inhuman action save thee.BOADICIA.Thy boasted calmness is the child of fear;Thou tremblest to exasperate the foe.Well was it, Britons, in our former conquests,That I presided o'er the scene of slaughter;Else had those thousands of the Roman youth,Whose bodies lie extended on our fields,Stood at this hour a threatning host against you.Come then, ye warriors, follow your conductress,And drag these slaves to death.DUMNORIX.They will not move,Fix'd with amazement at thy matchless frenzy.
Do thou revere these warriors, who with scornObserve thy folly.VENUSIA.Husband, sister, hear!Oh! if my humbled voice, my prostrate limbs,If tears and sighs of anguish may atoneFor this pernicious discord, I have rais'd—BOADICIAto VENUSIA.Hence with thy despicable sighs and tears.[To Dumnorix.And, thou presumptuous, what invidious power,Foe to thy safety, animates thy prideStill to contend with Boadicia's wrath?DUMNORIX.No, by Andate, I contend not with thee.At this important season, when the soldierThirsts for the conflict, it would ill become meTo trifle here in discord with a woman.Nay do not swell that haughty breast in vain.When once the sacred evidence of justiceIlluminates my bosom, on a rock,Which neither tears can soften, nor the gustsOf passion move, my resolution stands.BOADICIA.Now heav'n fulfil my curses on thy head!May ev'ry purpose of thy soul be frustrate!May infamy and ruin overtake thee!May base captivity and chains o'erwhelm thee!May shameful crimson from thy shoulders start,Like mine, dishonour'd with the servile scourge!With pain all shiv'ring, and thy flesh contracting,Low mayst thou crouch beneath th' expected stroke,Ev'n from the hands, thou sav'st!TENANTIUS.Alas! great princess,Divert this wrath against th' impending foe,Whose formidable ranks will soon descend
From yonder hill.BOADICIAto the Britons.Ungrateful and perfidious!Now would I draw my spirit from your camp,Leave you with him defenceless and expos'd;Then should your shatter'd chariots be o'erthrown,Your jav'lins broken, and in hasty flightFar from your trembling hands the buckler cast;Did not th' insatiate thirst, which burns my soul,To empty ev'ry vein of Roman blood,Protect you, traitors, from my indignation:But, by th' ensanguin'd altars of Andate,Thou, Dumnorix, be sure, shall't rue this day,For thou henceforward art to me a Roman.SCENE the Fifth.DUMNORIX, VENUSIA, TENANTIUS, EBRANCUS, TRINOBANTIANS, AENOBARBUS, and FLAMINIUS.VENUSIA.Oh! Dumnorix!DUMNORIX.Let not this frantic womanGrieve thy mild nature—Romans, cease to fear.These are my tents; retire in safety thither.SCENE the sixth.DUMNORIX, VENUSIA, TENANTIUS, EBRANCUS and TRINOBANTIANS.DUMNORIXto TENANTIUS.Do thou go forth this instant, and commandEach ardent youth to gird his falchion round him,His pond'rous spear to loosen from the turf,And race the target firmly on his am.
His car let ev'ry charioteer prepare,His warlike seat each combatant assume,That ev'ry banner may in battle wave,Ere the sun reaches his meridian height.SCENE the seventh.DUMNORIX, VENUSIA, EBRANCUS, and TRINOBANTIANS.VENUSIA.My lord and husband!DUMNORIX.Wherefore dost thou hold me,And in my passage thy endearments plant.I must prepare this moment to confrontThe foul and ghastly face of cruel war;And, by the gods, I rather court at presentThat shape of horrour, than thy beauteous form:Then go, thou dear intruder, and removeThy softness from me.VENUSIA.I will stay no longer,Than brave Tenantius hath perform'd thy orders.Long have I known thy valour skill'd to throwThe rapid dart, and lift th' unconquer'd shield.A confidence, like this, hath still diffus'dEnough of firmness thro' my woman's heartNe'er to molest thee with a woman's fears,This day excepted; now my weakness governs,And terror too importunate will speak.Hast thou encounter'd yet such mighty powers,As down that mountain suddenly will rush;From ev'ry part the Romans are assembled,All vers'd in arms, and terrible in valour.DUMNORIX.Tell me, thou lovely coward, am not I
As terrible? or falls the Roman swordOn the tough buckler, and the crested helmWith deadlier weight, than mine? away and fear not;Secure and calm, repose thee in thy tent;Think on thy husband, and believe, he conquers;Amid the rage of battle he will thinkOn thee; for thee he draws the martial blade;For thy lov'd infants gripes the pointed ash.Go, and expect me to return victorious;Thy hand shall dress my wounds, and all be well.VENUSIA.Far better be our fortune, than for theeTo want that office from my faithful hand,Or me to stain thy triumphs with my tears.DUMNORIX.Fear not. I tell thee, when thou seest my limbsWith dust bespread, my brows with glorious sweat,And some distinguish'd wound to grace my breast,Thou in the fulness of thy love shallt view me,And swear, I seem most comely in thy fight.Thy virtue then shall shew me worthier of thee,Than did thy fondness on our nuptial day.VENUSIA.It shall be so. All wounded thou shalt findMy heart prepar'd to stifle its regret,And smooth my forehead with obedient calmness.Yet hear me further; something will I offerMore, than the weak effects of female dread;Thou go'st to fight in discord with thy colleague:It is a thought, which multiplies my fears.DUMNORIX.Well urg'd, thou dearest counsellor, who bestCanst heal this mischief. Let thy meekness tryThe soft persuasion of a private conf'renceTo win from error a bewilder'd sister,While none are present to alarm her pride.VENUSIA.I go, but trembling doubt my vain attempt;Unless, commissioned with thy dear injunctions,My soul, exerted to perform thy pleasure,Could give persuasion all my force of duty.SCENE the eighth.DUMNORIX, EBRANCUS, TRINOBANTIANS, and TENANTIUS.DUMNORIX.Hark! we are summon'd.TENANTIUS.Ev'ry band is form'd.The Romans too in close arrangement stand.DUMNORIX.You, warriors, destin'd to begin the onset,My Trinobantians, it is time to seekTh'embattled foe. And you, all-judging gods,Look down benignant on a righteous cause!Indeed we cannot give you, like the Romans,A proud and sumptuous off'ring; we abound notIn marble temples, or in splendid altars:Yet though we want this vain, luxurious pomp,Rough though we wander on the mountain's head,Through the deep vale, and o'er the craggy rock,We still demand your favour; we can shewHands, which for justice draw th'avenging steel,Firm hearts, and manners undebas'd by fraud.To you, my dauntless friends, what need of words?Your cities have been sack'd, your children slain,Your wives dishonour'd; lo! on yonder hillsYou see the spoilers; there the ruffians stand:Your hands are arm'd; then follow, and revenge.End of the first Act.ACT II.SCENE the First.FLAMINIUS and AENOBARBUS.FLAMINIUS.HO! Aenobarbus, thou mayst now come forward.What has thy angry soul been brooding o'er?AENOBARBUS.Well, thou hast su'd, and hast obtain'd thy suit;Of these Barbarians meanly hast implor'dThy wretched life, and hast it. Must I thank theeFor this uncommon privilege to standA tame spectator of the Roman shame,To see exulting savages o'erturnOur walls and ramparts, see them with the spoilsOf our waste dwellings, with our captive eagles,And ancient trophies, ravish'd from our temples,March in rude triumph o'er the gods of Rome?FLAMINIUS.What, thou hadst rather die?AENOBARBUS.And thou hadst ratherLive, like a dog, in chains, than die with courage,Thou most unworthy of the Roman name.FLAMINIUS.Did those, who now inhabit Rome, deserve
The name of Romans? did the ancient spiritOf our forefathers still survive among us,I should applaud this bold contempt of life.Our ancestors, who liv'd, while Rome was free,Might well prefer a noble fate to chains;They lost a blessing, we have never known;Born and inur'd to servitude at home,We only change one master for another,And Dumnorix is far beyond a Nero.AENOBARBUS.Meanst thou to mock me?FLAMINIUS.No, I mean to shew,Thy stern opinions suit not with the times.AENOBARBUS.Still by our valour we control the world,And in that duty will I match the foremost.If our forefathers' manners be neglected,Free from that blame, I singly will maintain them.My sentiments are moulded by my spirit,Which wants thy pliant qualities to yieldWith ev'ry gust of fortune rude, or mild,And crouch beneath example base, or worthy.FLAMINIUS.Well, if thou canst not brook a British master—AENOBARBUS.No, nor thy wanton folly will I brook,Which sports alike with slavery, or freedom,Insensible of shame.FLAMINIUSSuppose, I free thee.AENOBARBUS.Free me?FLAMINIUS.This day, if fortune be propitious.AENOBARBUS.Ha! do not cheat me with delusive fables,
And trifle with my bonds.FLAMINIUS.By all my hopes,I do not trifle.AENOBARBUS.Willt thou give my bosomOnce more to buckle on the soldier's harness,And meet in battle our insulting foes?Shall my keen falchion gore the flying rout,And raise a bleeding trophy to revengeFor each indignity, which Rome hath borne?Hold me no longer in suspence; instruct me,From whence these hopes proceed.FLAMINIUS.Thou know'st, I lov'dThe British princess.AENOBARBUS.Hast thou rais'd my hopesTo freedom, future victory and honour,And dost thou talk of love?FLAMINIUS.That love shall save us.Thou saw'st, the gentle Emmeline but nowStole to our tent, and gave her tend'rest welcome.Unchang'd I found her, soft and artless still.The gen'rous maid already hath suggestedThe means of flight. The battle once begun,While ev'ry Briton is intent on war,Herself will guide us to a place of safety.AENOBARBUS.Now I commend thee.FLAMINIUS.Thou approv'st then.AENOBARBUS.Ay.FLAMINIUS.And see, the joyful moment is approaching;
See, where th'unnumber'd Trinobantians spreadIn rude disorder o'er the vale beneath,Whose broad extent this eminence commands.Mark their wide-waving multitude, confus'dWith mingling standards, and tumultuous cars:But far superior to the rest behold,The brave and gen'rous Dumnorix, erectWith eager hope, his lofty jav'lin shakes,And with unpolish'd majesty adornsThe front of war.AENOBARBUS.I mark the rabble well;And soon shall view the Romans from their stationBetween those woods, which shade the adverse hills,Sweep with resistless ardour to the vale,And trample o'er the savages, like dust.FLAMINIUS.That smiling vale with pity I contemplate,And wish, more gentle foot-steps might be seenTo press its verdure, and that softer notes,Than war's terrific clamours, might be tun'dFrom those surrounding shades to join the murmursOf that fair channel, whose sonorous bedReceives the stream, descending from this groveTo form the limpid maze, which shines below.AENOBARBUS.I see it glist'ning in the noon-day sun.But British gore will change its glassy hue.FLAMINIUS.Oh! might we rather on its friendly banksErect a grateful monument to peace;That she, her sway resuming, might afford meTo clasp the gallant Dumnorix, and stile himMy friend, my benefactor, and preserver—Stand from before this tempest, while it passes.SCENE the second.BOADICIA, ICENIANS, AENOBAREUS and FLAMINIUS at a distance.BOADICIA.Oh! I could drive this jav'lin thro' my heartTo ease its tortures. Disobey'd! Controll'd!Ev'n in my army's sight! Malignant pow'rs,If such there be, who o'er revenge preside,Who steel the breast with ever-during hate,And aid black rancour in its purpos'd mischief,Be present now, and guide my indignation![pausesThe Trinobantians are advanc'd before me.Let them sustain the onset; let the RomansOn Dumnorix with ev'ry cohort press,Till he entreat for Boadicia's aid:Then shall my eager eyes enjoy his ruin;And when th'insulting boaster is o'erthrown,His bands dispers'd, or gasping in the dust,Then will I rush exulting in my car,Like fierce Andatè, on the weary'd foeLead rout and slaughter, thro' a tide of goreImpel my clotted wheels, redeem the day,And from the mouth of danger snatching conquest,Crown my revenge with glory.SCENE the third.BOADICIA, ICENIANS, AENOBARBUS and FLAMINIUS at a distance, and VENUSIA.VENUSIA.Stand apartAt my request, Icenians▪ O unbend,[To Boad.
That louring brow, and hear a suppliant sister!So prone to errour is our mortal frame,Time could not step without a trace of horrour,If wary nature on the human heartAmid its wild variety of passionsHad not impress'd a soft and yielding sense,That when offences give resentment birth,The kindly dews of penitence may raiseThe seeds of mutual mercy and forgiveness.BOADICIA.Weak wretch, and yet whose impotence aspiresTo mix in warlike councils, and determineThe fate of captives, won in fields of death,Thou wouldst do better to reserve thy tears;Thou shall't have cause for penitential torrents.VENUSIA.They will not wait a second birth of woe;At thy severity they burst already.Why turns on me that formidable aspect,Wont with commanding sternness to beholdIts foes abash'd, and victory its vassal?Yet how much brighter is the wreath of glory,When interwove with clemency and justice.Thou go'st to battle, there obtain renown;But learn compassion from my tears, nor think,Benignity enfeebles, or dishonoursThe most exalted valour.BOADICIA.Shall the tearsOf abject importunity detain me,While vengeance, striding from his grizly den,With fell impatience grinds his iron teeth,And waits my nod to satisfy his hunger.Hence to th' employment of thy feeble distaff.VENUSIA.Not skill'd, like thee, in war's ennobling toils,Inferiour praise, and humbler tasks I court,And own my safety in thy loftier virtues;
Yet not like thee, with unforgiving wrathCould I resign a sister to her griefAt this tremendous hour, so near decidingThe fate of both. One gentle word bestow,And I will leave thee with obedient haste;Nay I will seek the altars, and request,That in the future triumphs of this dayHeav'n may refuse to Dumnorix a share,And give thee all.BOADICIA.Does Dumnorix consentTo sacrifice the Romans? art thou mute?Still does he brave me? but your favour'd captivesShall not escape. They soon shall join the victims,Which this unconquer'd jav'lin shall reserveTo solemnize the fall of Rome's dominion.Then to my glory Dumnorix shall bend.In sight of Britain shall his baffled prideThe pomp of public sacrifice behold,Behold and pine. You take a band of soldiers;[To an Icenian.Watch well around the Trinobantian tents,And guard these Romans, as your lives. I tell thee,[To Venus.Their gore shall yet besmear Andate's altar.VENUSIA.In silent awe I heard thy first resentment,Yet hop'd the well known accents of affection,In kindness whisper'd to thy secret ear,Might to thy breast recal its exil'd pity,That gentle inmate of a woman's heart.BOADICIA.Durst thou, presumptuous, entertain a thoughtTo give this bosom, nerv'd with manly strength,The weak sensations of a female spirit?VENUSIA.When I remind thy elevated soul,
That we by mutual interests are but one,And by th' indissoluble ties of birth,Are those sensations weak, which nature prompts?With justice strengthen'd, can her pow'rful voiceFind no persuasion.—BOADICIA.None. Provoke no moreWith plaintive murmurs my indignant ear.Thou, and thy husband, authors of my shameBefore th' assembled chiefs, may rest assur'd,No prayers shall soften, no attonement bribe,And no submission shall appease the wrong.May desolation trample on my dwellingA second time, rapacious force again,And insult revel through my inmost chambers,If I forgive you. Thou hast food for anguish;Go, and indulge its appetite at leisure.VENUSIA.Yes, I will hasten to the holy shrine,There wring my hands, and melt in copious sorrowNot for my injur'd self, but thee remorseless,To mourn thy faded honours, which, deform'dBy harsh injustice to thy blameless friends,Ne'er will revive in beauty. Not success,Not trophies rising round thee; not the throngOf circling captives, and their conquer'd standards,Nor glorious dust of victory can hideFrom just reproach thy unrelenting scorn,While none deplore thee, but the wrong'd Venusia.SCENE the fourth.BOADICIA, ICENIANS, AENOBARBUS and FLAMINIUS at a distance.BOADICIA.Stern pow'r of war, my patroness and guide,
To thee each captive Roman I devote.Come then, vindictive goddess in thy terrours;O'erwhelm with wrath his sacrilegious head,Who would defraud thy altars: O confoundHis ranks, his steeds, his chariots, and thy favourTo me, thy martial votaress, confine,In sex, like thee, and glowing with thy fires.SCENE the fifth.AENOBARBUS and FLAMINIUS.AENOBARBUS.Do thou come forward now, and say, what terroursHas thy dejected soul been brooding o'er?Yon furious dame, who fill'd thee so with dread,Is marching onward. Raise thy head, and look.See, where ev'n now with sullen pride she mountsHer martial seat; yet wondrous slow, by heav'n,Her car descends, nor soon will reach the vale.Thou lookst desponding. Art thou still dismay'd?Thinkst thou, yon dreadful woman will return?From us she moves, though slowly; then take comfort.FLAMINIUS.Far other cares, than terrour, fill my breast.AENOBARBUS.What means this languor? Wherefore heaves that sigh?FLAMINIUS.O Aenobarbus, willt thou bear my weakness;I see the moment of deliv'rance near,Yet pine with grief.AENOBARBUS.Whate'er the folly be,With which thy bosom teems, the gods confound it.FLAMINIUS.To see the dearest object of my soul,Just see her after such a tedious absence,
Then vanish from her sight perhaps for ever,When these reflections rise, the sweet exchangeFrom bonds to freedom, which to her I owe,Is mix'd with bitterness, and joy subsides.AENOBARBUS.Why didst thou leave the fair Italian fields,Thou silken slave of Venus? what could moveThee to explore these boist'rous northern climes,And change yon radiant sky for Britain's clouds?What dost thou here, effeminate? by heav'nThou shouldst have loiter'd in Campania's villasAnd in thy garden nurs'd with careful handsThe gaudy-vested progeny of Flora;Or indolently pac'd the pebbled shore,And ey'd the beating of the Tuscan waveTo waste thy irksome leisure. Will't thou tell me,What thou dost here in Britain? dost thou comeTo sigh and pine? could Italy affordNo food for these weak passions? must thou traverseSuch tracts of land, and visit this cold regionTo love and languish? answer me, what motiveFirst brought thee hither? but forbear to urge,It was in quest of honour; for the godOf war disclaims thee.FLAMINIUS.Well, suppose, I answer,That friendship drew me from the golden Tiber,With thee to combat this inclement sky,Will it offend thee?AENOBARBUS.No, I am thy friend,And I will make a Roman of thee still;But let me see no languishing dejectionMore on thy brow, nor hear unmanly sighs.Gods! can'st thou dream of love? When yonder se,The Roman legions, all array'd for battle,Are now descending; see their dreaded eagles,
Their dazzling helmets, and their crimson plumes:A grove of jav'lins glitters down the steep;They point their terrours on th' astonish'd foe;Soon will they charge the Britons in the vale,And with th' auspicious glories of this dayEnrich the annals of imperial Rome.O curst captivity! with double weightI feel thee now! malicious fate! to sufferA Roman thus to stand confin'd in bondage,And see the triumphs, which he cannot share.By heav'n, Flaminius, I will never bear it.Where is thy Briton? Will she lead us hence?Else, by the god of war, unarm'd I rushTo join the glorious scene, which opens there.FLAMINIUS.I see her coming, and will fly to meet her.AENOBARBUS.Our time is short, remember; do not dally.SCENE the sixth.AENOBARBUS.I have a thought, lyes rip'ning in my breast,And teems with future glory, if the fightProve undecisive, and these tents subsist.Soon will I bid thee, hostile camp, farewell.Thou saw'st me come in thraldom; I departA fugitive: if ever I return,Thou shallt receive me in another guise;Then shallt thou feel me; when my shining helmShall strike cold terrour through thy boldest guards,And from its lofty crest destruction shake.End of the second Act.ACT III.SCENE the first.FLAMINIUS and AENOBARBUS.FLAMINIUS.OUR lovely guide attends us. Thy impatienceHath call'd me loit'rer.AENOBARBUS.Thou mayst loiter still.Thou canst not hasten, nor retard our fate,Which is irrevocably fix'd.FLAMINIUS.What say'st thou?AENOBARBUS.I say, prepare to die. If BoadiciaReturn once more, our destiny is fix'd.Whate'er her merciless revenge may purpose,Elate with conquest, or incens'd by loss,If on the rack to strain our bursting sinews,If from the bleeding trunks to lop our lims,Or with slow fires protract the hours of pain,We must abide it all. Collect thy spirit,And, like a Roman, dauntless wait thy doom.FLAMINIUS.I hear thee, but thy meaning—AENOBARBUS.Hear again.Before the tent some paces as I stood,And joyful saw the Trinobantian guard,Of us neglectful, from this quarter drawnTo view th'impending battle; on a suddenA curs'd Icenian cast his jealous eyeAthwart my steps, then call'd a num'rous band,Who prowl around us, as a destin'd prey.FLAMINIUS.Malicious fortune!AENOBARBUS.Now thou seest my meaning.FLAMINIUS.Our flight were vain, while these observe us.AENOBARBUS.True.What has thy tame submission now avail'd,Thy abject supplication to barbarians?Hadst thou with courage met thy fate at first,We had been dead, ere now.FLAMINIUS.To view the sunThro' his gay progress from the morn, till even▪Possess my friends, my parents, and my loveWithin the circle of my native wallsWere joys, I deem'd well worthy of my care;But since that care is fruitless, I can leaveThis light, my friends, my parents, love, and country;As little daunted at my fate, as thou,Tho' not so unconcern'd.AENOBARBUS.O Mars and Vesta!Is it a vision, which you raise before meTo charm my eyes? Behold a scene, Flaminius,
To cheer a Roman in the gasp of death.The Britons are defeated; look, Flaminius;Back from the vale in wild tumultuous flightBehold their numbers sweeping tow'rd the hill;Already some are swarming up its sideTo reach their camp for shelter; pale dismayWith hostile rage pursue their broken rear,While massacre, unchidden, cloys his famine,And quaffs the blood of nations. O in vainDost thou oppose thy bosom to the tideOf war, and brandish that recover'd standard;Vain is thy animating voice to those,Whom fear makes deaf; O Dumnorix, thy toilsAre fruitless, Britain in the scale of fateYields to the weight of Rome. Now, life, farewell:Shine on, bright Phoebus, those, who rest behindTo share thy splendours, while I sink in darkness,Are far beneath my envy; I resignThese eyes with pleasure to eternal shades,They now have seen enough.FLAMINIUS.Whence this despair?A blind confusion fills the spacious camp.Already consternation hath dispers'dOur guard. Ev'n Dumnorix retires—He comes;Avoid him—Trust me, I am well instructed,And will conduct thee to a safe retreatSCENE the second.DUMNORIXwith a standard.Thou hard-kept remnant of our shatter'd fortune,Stand there before the partial eye of heav'n,Which has preferr'd the Romans' splendid altars,To the plain virtue of a British heart.Presumptuous frenzy! Why is heav'n reproach'd?O Boadicia, thou perfidious mischief!SCENE the third.DUMNORIX and VENUSIA.VENUSIA.Now let my duty o'er my fear prevail,Fill my whole breast with tenderness, and healWith sweetest comfort thy distress.DUMNORIX.My wife!Thou most unlike to you degen'rate woman,Her country's bane!VENUSIA.I tremble at thy words.DUMNORIX.Be not dismay'd; the camp is still our own.Night is impending, and the Romans halt.VENUSIA.But what of Boadicia?DUMNORIX.Hear and mourn.The Trinobantians scarce had fill'd the vale,When from a narrow pass between the woodsForth burst the Romans, wedg'd in deep array.I found our struggle vain, and sent for aidTo Boadicia; she with scorn reply'd,I did not want th' assistance of a woman;Nor left her station, till my broken ranksWere driv'n among th' Icenians: in a momentAll was confusion, slaughter and defeat.SCENE the fourth.DUMNORIX, VENUSIA, and BOADICIA-DUMNORIX.Gods! art thou safe?VENUSIA.Oh! most unhappy sister!When last we parted, cruel were thy words,A sure presage of endless grief to me;Yet my desponding spirit ne'er foreboded,That thou couldst deviate from a prosp'rous course,When ev'ry gale conspir'd to swell thy glory.BOADICIA.Throw not on me the crime of envious fortune.DUMNORIX.Dost thou blame fortune, traitress?BOADICIA.Then the blameTake on thy single head.DUMNORIX.Avoid my sight.BOADICIA.Thou ledst the van.DUMNORIX.Avaunt.BOADICIA.Thou fledst the first,Now findst too late th'importance of a woman.DUMNORIX.Too true I find a woman curs'd with pow'rTo blast a nation's welfare. Heavenly rulers!How have the Britons merited this shame?Have we with fell ambition, like the Romans,Unpeopled realms, and made the world a desart?Have we your works defac'd; or how deserv'dSo large a measure of your bitt'rest wrath,That you should cloath this spirit of a wolfIn human form, and blend her lot with ours?BOADICIA.Beset with perils, as I am, pursu'dBy rout and havoc to th'encirc'ling toyl;Untam'd by this reverse, my lofty soul,
Upbraiding still thy arrogance, demands,Who spar'd the captive Romans? Who provok'dMy just resentment? Who, in pow'r, in nameAnd dignity inferior, but elateWith blind presumption, and by envy stung,Dar'd to dispute with me supreme command,Then pale and trembling turn'd his back on danger?VENUSIA.O once united by the friendliest ties,And leaders both of nations, shall this landStill view its bulwarks, tott'ring with disunion,Enhance the public and their own misfortunes?Thou, my complacent lord, wert wont to smoothThat manly front at pity's just complaint;And, thou entrusted with a people's welfare,A queen and warrior, let disdain no moreLive in the midst of danger—see VenusiaUpon her knees—DUMNORIX.Shall thy perfections kneelTo this—VENUSIA.Oh! stop, nor give resentment utt'rance.In such a cause the proudest knee might sueTo less, than Boadicia—Turn not from me[To BoadiciaLook on a prostrate sister! Think, thou hear'stOur children's plaintive notes enforce my pray'r,And Albion's genius mix his solemn moan;That lamentations through thy ears resoundFrom all the wives and mothers of those thousands,Whose limbs lie stretch'd on yonder fields of death;Those wretched wives and mothers, oh! reflect,But for the fatal discord of this dayWith other looks, with other cries and gestures,With diffrent transports, and with diff'rent tears
Might have receiv'd their sons and husbands home,Than they will now survey their pale remains,Which there lye mangled by the Roman swordTo feed the raven's hunger—yet relent!Yet let restoring union close our wounds,And to repair this ruin be thy praise!DUMNORIX.Rise, rise. Thy mildness, whose persuasive charmNo cruelty, but hers, could hear unmov'd,In vain would render placable and wiseThat malice, inhumanity and frenzy,Which have already wasted such a storeOf glory and success.BOADICIA.Oh!DUMNORIX.Dost thou groan?BOADICIA.No, no, I do not feel a moment's pain.DUMNORIX.Thy words are false. Thy heart o'erflows with anguish.BOADICIA.No, I despise both thee and fortune still.DUMNORIX.By heav'n, I know distraction rends thy soul,And to its view presents th' approaching sceneOf shame and torture, when th' indignant RomansExact a tenfold vengeance for their suff'rings;And when thou passest through their streets in chains,The just derision of insulting foes,A frantic woman, who resign'd her hopes,And to indulge an empty pride betray'dHer children, friends and country; then recal,What once was Boadicia, fall'n how lowFrom all her honours, by her folly fall'nFrom pow'r, from empire, victory and gloryTo vilest bonds, and ignominious stripes.BOADICIA.May curses blast thee, worse, than I can utter,And keener pangs, than whips, or shackles seize thee!VENUSIA.Oh! sister, how unseemly is this rage.Whom dost thou load with these ungen'rous curses?Thy faithful friend, thy counsellour and brother,Whom thou hast injur'd, injur'd past the pow'rOf reparation. Dost thou call for whipsTo print those venerable limbs with shame,For bonds to humble that majestic head,Which foes themselves must honour? yet, if chainsMust be our fate, what cruel hand hath forg'd them,But thine alone? thy hand hath heap'd destructionOn him, thy once rever'd ally, on me,On my poor children, guiltless of offence,And on thy own, who claim'd protection ftom thee;Yet thou obdurate, to thy rage a prey,Dost chide remorse and pity from thy breast.DUMNORIXto BOADICIA.Source of thy own afflictions! to behold theeDistracted thus, thus fall'n and lost, to seeThus strongly painted on thy lab'ring featuresThe pangs, thou feel'st within, awakes compassion.BOADICIA.Ha! no—divine Andate shall uphold meAbove thy pity. Think'st thou, BoadiciaIs thus deserted by her patron goddess,Thus void of all resources? think so still,And be deceiv'd. Ev'n now I feel her aid;[aside.I feel her ere; the warlike queen inspiresMy pregnant soul; the mighty plan is forming;It grows, it labours in my ardent bosom;It springs to life, and calls for instant action;Lead on, exert thee, goddess, till the furies,Which heretofore have thunder'd at thy heels,Start at the new-born horrours of this night.SCENE the fifth.DUMNORIX and VENUSIA.VENUSIA.Oh! Dumnorix, how virtue hath recoil'dUpon itself! my interposing pity,Thy manly firmness in a gen'rous actGave these disasters being.DUMNORIX.I forbid theeTo blame thy virtues, which the gods approve,And I revere. Now leave me to concetWith our surviving chiefs the means of safety.VENUSIA.Oh! that, like me, compliant, at thy wordPeace a benign companion would attend,And moderate thy cares, while I depart.SCENE the sixth.DUMNORIX.Have I been guilty? answer me, my heart,Who now wouldst burst my agonizing breast,Hath Dumnorix been guilty? willt thou, Britain,To me impute the horrours of this day?Perhaps a Roman's policy had yielded,And to a colleague's cruelty and prideHad sacrific'd humanity and justice;I did not so, and Albion is destroy'd.Yet, O be witness, all ye gen'rous spirits,So lately breathing in those heaps of death,That in this day's extremity and perilYour Dumnorix was mindful of his charge;My shiver'd javelin, my divided shield,And blunted sword, be witness for your master,
You were not idle in that dreadful hour:Nor ev'n amid the carnage pil'd around me,Will I relinquish my pursuit of hope—Hope may forsake me—For myself I fear not—But my Venusia—Ha! prepare, my soul—There is thy struggle, on her tender mindTo graft thy firmness, which can welcome death,And hold it gain, when liberty is lost.End of the third Act.ACT IV.SCENE the First.DUMNORIX.TILL good Tenantius, and the rest return,I have been led by solitary careTo you dark branches, spreading o'er the brook,Which murmurs through the camp; this mighty camp,Where once two hundred thousand sons of warWith restless dins awak'd the midnight hour.Now horrid stillness in the vacant tentsSits undisturb'd; and these incessant rills,Whose pebbled channel breaks their shallow stream,Fill with their melancholly sound my ears,As if I wander'd, like a lonely hind,O'er some dead fallow far from all resort:Unless that ever and anon a groanBursts from a soldier, pillow'd on his shieldIn torment, or expiring with his wounds,And turns my fix'd attention into horrour.Venusia comes—The hideous scene around me
Now prompts the hard, but necessary duty—Yet how to name thee, death, without thy terrours!SCENE the second.DUMNORIX and VENUSIA.VENUSIA.Thou didst enjoin my absence. I departed.With ill-tim'd care if now returning—DUMNORIX.No.VENUSIA.Alas! deep-plung'd in sadness still I find thee.DUMNORIX.Dost thou? come nearer. Thou hast seen this day,How thy perfidious, thy invet'rate sisterHath stain'd my glory, and my fortune baffled;Thou hast received me vanquish'd, who beforeWas us'd to greet thee with the sound of conquest.Now tell me truly; am I still the sameIn my Venusia's eyes.VENUSIA.What means my lord;DUMNORIX.Am I still lov'd and honour'd, as before?VENUSIA.Canst thou suspect, that fortune rules my love?Thy pow'r and honours may be snatch'd away,Thy wide possessions pass to other lords,And, frowning heav'n resume whate'er it gave,All but my love, which ne'er shall know decay,But ev'n in ruin shall augment its fondness.DUMNORIX.Then will my dictates be regarded still.VENUSIA.Impart this moment thy rever'd commands,
And if it prove within my slender pow'rTo ease thy troubles, I will bless the gods,And unrepining to our fate submit.DUMNORIX.Think not, my own calamities distress me;I can encounter fortune's keenest malice:But oh! for thee, Venusia—VENUSIA.Do not fear.While in these faithful arms I hold my lord,I never shall complain. Let ev'ry ill,Let ruin and captivity oe'rtake me,With thee I will be happy.DUMNORIX.Ha! Venusia!Could thou and I find happiness together,Depriv'd of freedom? Dost thou mark?VENUSIA.I do.DUMNORIX.Thou art most fair; but could thy lovely faceMake slavery look comely? Could the touchOf that soft hand convey delight to mineWith servile fetters on?VENUSIA.Why dost thou gazeSo stedfastly upon me?DUMNORIX.I would have theeReflect once more upon the loss of freedom.VENUSIA.It is the heaviest sure of human woes.DUMNORIX.Learn one thing more, and though relentless heav'nIts care withdraws from this ill-destin'd isle,Thou in the fall of nations shallt be safe.Oh! heed Venusia! never did thy welfare
Raise in my breast such tender cares before;Else from the public danger would I spareThese precious moments to assist thy virtue.VENUSIA.Thou mak'st me all attention.DUMNORIX.Reach thy hand.Now while I hold thee, do I bless Andate,That this free hand, protected by my sword,Hath not yet known the shameful doom of bondage.VENUSIA.Nor shall I know it; thy unshaken valourWill be my safeguard still.DUMNORIX.If fate confoundsMy utmost efforts, can I then protect thee?VENUSIA.Why dost thou lead me to despair? Why fillMy breast with terrours? Never did I see thee,Till this sad hour, thus hopeless and dejected.Oh! how shall I, a woman weak and fearful,Sustain my portion of the gen'ral woe;If thou, in perils exercis'd and war,Dost to ill fortune bow thy gallant spirit?DUMNORIX.Think not, Venusia, I abandon hope.No, on the verge of ruin will I stand,And dauntless combat with our evil fate;Nor, till its rancour bear me to the bottom,My soul shall ever entertain despair:But as the wisest, and the best resolv'dCannot controll the doubtful chance of war,I would prepare thee for the worst event.VENUSIA.Fly, where thou willt, my faithful steps shall follow.I can pursue thy course with naked feet,Though roaming o'er the rough and pointed crags,
Or through the pathless tract of deepest woods;By thy dear hand supported, would IpassThrough the cold snow, which hides the mountain's brow,And o'er the frozen surface of the vale.DUMNORIX.Thou best of women, I believe thou wouldst,Believe, thy constant heart would teach those limbs,Thus soft and gentle, to support all hardship,And hold with me society in toil.But should we want the wretched pow'r to fly,What then?VENUSIA.What then?DUMNORIX.The Romans may surround us.VENUSIA.How wouldst thou act in such a dreadful season?DUMNORIX.Ne'er shall the hands of Dumnorix endureThe shame of fetters; ne'er shall Rome beholdThis breast, which honourable war hath seam'd,Pant with the load of bondage: gen'rous wounds,Ye deep engraven characters of glory,Ye faithful monitors of Albion's cause,Oft, when you midnight anguish hath rebuk'dOblivious slumber from my watchful pillow,And in her danger kept my virtue waking:You, when that office can avail no more,Will look more graceful on my death-cold bosom,Than to be shewn before the scoffing Romans,Should they behold that Dumnorix in shackles,Whom once they dreaded on the field of war.VENUSIA.Assist me heav'n!DUMNORIX.Speak out. I watch to hear thee.My pow'rs are all suspended with attention.VENUSIA.What shall I do?DUMNORIX.Explain thy thoughts.VENUSIA.I cannot.DUMNORIX.Why canst thou not? Remember, who thou art,And who thy husband is.VENUSIA.The first of men,Join'd to the least deserving of her sex.DUMNORIX.View thy own heart; be conscious of thy merit;And in its strength confiding, be secure,That thou art worthy of the greatest man,And not unequal to the noblest task.VENUSIA.O I will struggle to assist that claim!Yet dearest lord, extend thy whole indulgence,Nor undeserving of thy love esteem me,While trembling thus.DUMNORIX.I know thy native softness.Yet wherefore dost thou tremble? Speak, my love.VENUSIA.O I have not thy courage, not been us'd,Like thee, to meet the dreadful shape of death;I never felt the anguish of a wound;Thy arm hath still kept danger at a distance:If now it threatens, and my heart no moreMust treat with safety, it is new to me.DUMNORIX.It is, my love. My tenderness impliesNo expectation, that thy gentle mindShould be at once familiariz'd with fate.Not insurmountable I hold our danger.
But to provide against delusive fortune,That thou mayst bear, unterrify'd, the lot,Which best shall suit thy dignity and name,Demands thy care: take counsel of thy virtue.VENUSIA.I will.DUMNORIX.And arm thy breast with resolution.VENUSIA.Indeed I will, and ask the gracious godsTo fill my heart with constancy and spirit,And shew me worthy of a man, like thee.Perhaps their succour, thy rever'd injunction,And high example, may controll my terrours;But oh! what pow'r shall sooth another care,Than life more precious, and a keener pang,Than death's severest agony, relieve;The sad remembance of my helpless infants,Our love's dear pledges, who before me riseIn orphan woe, defenceless and forsaken,And all my borrow'd fortitude dissolve,DUMNORIX.Thou perfect pattern of maternal fondness,And conjugal compliance, rest assur'd,That care was never absent from my soul.Confide in me thy children shall be safe.VENUSIA.How safe?DUMNORIX.Shall live in safety. Thou shallt know.Mean time retire. Our anxious chiefs, return'd,Wait my commands, and midnight is advancing,SCENE the third.DUMNORIX.She goes—her love and duty will surmount
This hideous Task—O morning bright in hope,Clos'd by a night of horrour, which reducesThis poor—dear woman, yet in blooming years,Bless'd in her husband, in her offspring bless'd,Perhaps to cut her stem of being shortWith her own tender hand—If ever tearsMight sort with valour, nor debase a soldier,It would be now—Ha! whither do I plunge?SCENE the Fourth.DUMNORIX, EBRANCUS, TENANTIUS and TRINOBANTIANS.DUMNORIX.Well, my brave friends, what tidings?EBRANCUS.Through thy quarterWith weary steps, and mourning, have we travers'dA silent desart of unpeopled tentsQuite to the distant station of th' Icenians.Their chiefs we found in council round their queen;The multitude was arming: twenty thousandWere yet remaining, and unhurt by war,Unlike our Trinobantians, who, unaided,The fatal onset bore. Those huge battalions,Which Rome so dreaded, are alas! no more.DUMNORIX.Be not dejected. Far the greater part,Are fled for shelter to their native roofs,And will rejoin us, when with force repair'dWe may dispute our island still with Rome.But have you gain'd access to Boadicia?EBRANCUS.We have.DUMNORIX.What said she?EBRANCUS.She approv'd thy counselDUMNORIX.You told her then my purpose to retreatThrough yonder forest.EBRANCUS.To herself aloneWe told it.DUMNORIX.I commend you. You have sav'd usA conference, both needless and unpleasing.EBRANCUS.She further bade us note, how all th' IceniansWere then in arms, and ready to advance.DUMNORIX.Return, and tell her, (let thy phrase, Ebrancus,Be soft and humble) e're two hours be wasted,We must begin our march. Do you explore[To the other Trinobantians.The secret passage, and with winged hasteBring back your tidings. Thou, Tenantius, wait.SCENE the fifth.DUMNORIX and TENANTIUS.DUMNORIX.To thee my inmost bosom I must open,And to thy friendship trust my tend'rest cares.Thou must pursue thy journey (heed me well)Quite through the forest—Dost thou know the pass?TENANTIUS.Yes, where those gushing waters leave the groveTo seek the valley, deeper in the shadeFrom the same fountain flows a smaller brookWhose secret channel through the thicket windsAnd will conduct me farther down the vle—DUMNORIX.Which once attain'd, proceed and gain my dwelling.Give me thy honest hand.—Come nearer, soldier,Thy faithful bosom would I clasp to mine—Perhaps thy general and thou may neverEmbrace again.TENANTIUS.What means my fearless chief?Why hast thou call'd this unaccustom'd moistureInto thy soldier's eyes?DUMNORIX.Thou dost not weep,My gallant vet'ran—I have been to blame.A tenderness, resulting from a care,Which struggles here, subdu'd me for a moment.This shall be soon discharg'd, and all be well.I have two boys—If after all my efforts(I speak not prompted by despair, but caution)Rome should prevail against me, and our hopesAbortive fall, thou take these helpless infants;With thee transport them to our northern frontier,And hide them deep in Caledonian woods.There in their growing years excite and cherishThe dear remembrance of their native fields;That to redeem them from th' Italian spoiler,If e'er some kind occasion should invite,Forth from their covert they may spring undaunted.Ne'er let the race of Dumnorix divertOne thought from Albion to their own repose.Remind them often of their father's toils,Whom thou leav'st grappling to the last with fortune.And if beneath this island's mould'ring stateI to avoid disgraceful chains must sink,Fain would my spirit in the hope depart,That on the ruins, which surround my fall,A new born structure may hereafter stand,Rais'd by my virtue, living in my sons.End of th fourth Act.ACT V.SCENE the First.VENUSIA.A Hollow sound of tumult strikes my ear;Perhaps the howl of some night-roaming wolves,Who, wak'd by hunger, from their gloomy hauntsAre trooping forth to make their fell repastOn my fresh-bleeding countrymen, whose limbsO'erspread the valley. Shall I mourn your fall,Lost friends, who, couch'd in death, forget your cares,I, who may shortly join your ghastly band,Unless that forest yield its friendly aid?O hope, sweet flatt'rer, whose delusive touchSheds on afflicted minds the balm of comfort,Relieves the load of poverty, sustainsThe captive, bending with the weight of bonds,And smooths the pillow of disease and pain,Send back th' exploring messenger with joy,And let me hail thee from that friendly grove.SCENE the second.VENUSIA and DUMNORIX.DUMNORIX.Why hast thou left thy couch;VENUSIA.I heard a sound,Like tumult at a distance.DUMNORIX.So did I,As near the op'ning pass I stood to watchOur messenger's return.SCENE the third.VENUSIA, DUMNORIX, and EBRANCUS.DUMNORIXto EBRANCUS.What means this haste?Why lookst thou pale?EBRANCUS.With thy instructions charg'd,I sought th'Icenian quarter. All aroundWas solitude and silence. When I call'd,No voice reply'd. To Boadicia's tentWith fearful haste I trod. Her daughters thereI found in consternation I enquir'dThe cause, they answer'd only with their tears;Till from the princess Emmeline at lastI learn'd, that all th' Icenians were that hourIn silent march departed; but their courseShe could not tell me: that her furious motherHad with a fell, determin'd, look enjoin'd themTo wait her pleasure, which should soon be known;Mean time to rest immoveable and mute.SCENE the fourth.VENUSIA, DUMNORIX, EBRANCUS, and an ICENIAN carrying a bowl.VENUSIA.My Dumnorix, defend me.DUMNORIX.Ha! what meansThis wild demeanour—willt thou speak, Icenian?—Fear not my love; thy Dumnorix is near.What is that bowl, thou carry'st?ICENIAN.If ought appears disorder'd in my gesture,Which ill becomes the reverence, I owe thee,Charge that demerit to my horrid errand,And not to me.VENUSIA.What will befal us now!DUMNORIXto the ICENIAN.Willt thou begin?ICENIAN.I come from Boadicia.DUMNORIX.Where is she?ICENIAN.Far advanc'd o'er yonder vale.DUMNORIX.With what intention?ICENIAN.To assail the Romans.DUMNORIX.Assail the Romans?ICENIAN.To surprize their campAt this dead hour with unexpected slaughter.
Before she march'd, to me this secret chargeIn words, like these, she gave.

No more in thraldom, but a Roman leader?FLAMINIUS.Amid the tumult of your late defeatWe sought th'adjacent forest; thence we pass'dThe vale below and reach'd the Roman tents.DUMNORIX.And now are masters o our late retreat.—Had I been cruel, Britain had been safe.FLAMINIUS.Was this an act unworthy of a soldier?DUMNORIX.Our woes are all the progeny of folly,Not charg'd to thee or fortune.VENUSIA.Heav'n well pleas'dPerhaps ordain'd this unforeseen event,That our benevolence to brave FlaminiusIts due return of gratitude should find.FLAMINIUS.The life, you gave me, to your mutual welfareI here devote.

Rise, and hear.Though we reject the wretched boon of life,Thou may'st, Flaminius, yet repay our bounty.FLAMINIUS.Then will I ask no other grace from heav'n.DUMNORIX.We have two children.VENUSIA.O my bleeding heart!My poor, deserted infants, whom these armsNo more must cherish, nor my lulling voiceHush in the quiet of my sheltring bosom!DUMNORIXaside.Yet shall not this unman me. I will feelA father's anguish, but conceal the pain.[To Flam.Know then, I meant this faithful friend, Tenantius,Should traverse yonder wood, and bear my sonsFar from these borders to extremest north,Where they might dwell secure, nor share the ills,Doom'd to their parents.

All hail! thou last of daysTo this nigh-finish'd being. Radiant pow'r,Thou through thy endless journey mayst proclaim,That Dumnorix dy'd free, for thou shallt view it.
Behold th' appointed signal from the grove,Just as Flaminius warn'd us, is appear'dTo call Suetonius, and his legions on.Come, desolation, tyranny resortTo thy new seat; come, slavery, and bendThe neck of Albion, all her sons debase,And ancient virtue from their hearts expel.Now then, ye honour'd mansions of our fathers,Ye hallow'd altars, and ye awful groves,The habitation of our gods, farewell!And yet the guilty auth'ress of these woesDeserves a share of praise, who, still retainingOne unextinguish'd spark of gen'rous honour,Scorn'd to remain spectatress, or partakerOf Albion's fall, and, dying, still is free.Need I say more, Venusia?VENUSIA.Oh! my lord.DUMNORIX.Why heaves that sigh?VENUSIA.Alas! I am a woman.DUMNORIX.True, a defenceless woman, and expos'dTo keener sorrow by thy matchless beauty;That charm, which captivates the victor's eye,Yet helpless to withstand his savage force,Throws wretched woman under double ruin.But wherefore this? Thy virtue knows its duty.VENUSIA.Stay but a little.DUMNORIX.aside.Would I might for years!But die that thought—False tenderness, away.Thou British genius, who art now retiringFrom this lost region, yet suspend thy flight;And in this conflict lend me all thy spirit—
We only ask thee to be free and die.Well, my Venusia; is thy soul resolv'd?Or shall I still afford a longer pause?VENUSIA.Though my weak sex by nature is not arm'dWith fortitude▪ like thine, of this be sure;That dear subjection to thy honour'd will,Which hath my life directed, ev'n in deathShall not forsake me; and thy faithful wifeShall with obedience meet thy last commands.But canst thou tell me; is it hard to die?DUMNORIX.Oh! rather ask me, if to live in shame,Captivity and sorrow be not hard?VENUSIA.Oh! miserable!DUMNORIX.In a foreign landThe painful toils of servitude to bearFrom an imperious mistress?VENUSIA.Dreadful thought!DUMNORIX.Or be insulted with the hateful loveOf some proud master?VENUSIA.Oh! proceedNo further!DUMNORIX.From thy native seat of dwelling,From all the known endearments of thy home,From parents, children, friends and—husband torn.VENUSIA.Stop there, and reach the potion; nor to drinkThe cure of troubles will I longer pause.SCENE the twelfth.VENUSIA.For ev'ry pass'd possession of delight,Both in my offspring, and their godlike sire,A dying matron bends her grateful knee,Ye all disposing pow'rs! as now these blessingsMust reach their period, to my sons transferThat copious goodness, I have shar'd so long!Through my resigning soul that promise breathe,And my last moments comfort thus with peace!SCENE the thirteenth.VENUSIA and DUMNORIX with a bowl.DUMNORIXaside, seeing Venusia on her knees.Now resolution, now be doubly arm'd[He gives her the bowl and she drinks.Now stand awhile before the fanning breeze.So with its subtle energy the potion,Less rudely stealing on the pow'rs of life,Will best perform its office to removePain, fear and grief for ever from thy breast.How dost thou fare, Venusia?VENUSIA.I perceiveNo alteration. Every sense remainsYet unimpair'd. Then while these moments last,Let me on thee direct my eyes to gaze,While unobstructed still their sight endures;Let me receive thee to my faithful bosom,Before my heart is motionless and cold:Speak to me, Dumnorix! my lord! my husband!Give one kind accent to thy dying wife,Ere yet my ears be frozen, and thy voice
Be heard no longer; join thy lip to mine,While I can feel thy last and tend'rest kisses.DUMNORIX.Yes, I will utter to thy dying earAll my fond heart, sustain thee on my bosom,And cheer thy parting spirit in its flight.Oh! wheresoe'er thy fleeting breath shall pass,Whate'er new body, as the Druids sing,Thou shallt inform hereafter, still thy soul,Thou gentle, kind, and ever-pleasing creature;Shall bear its own felicity along,Still in its native sweetness shall be bless'd,And in its virtue, which can thus subdueThe fear of death, still brave the pow'r of fortune.But thou beginst to droop.VENUSIA.My eyes grow dizzy.DUMNORIXaside.Keep firm, my heart.VENUSIA.A heaviness, like sleep,O'ercomes my senses—Every limb is faint—Thy voice is scarce distinguish'd in my ears.DUMNORIX.Indeed!VENUSIA.Alas! thou lookst so kindly on me!My weak, and darken'd sight deceives me sure,Or thy fond eye did never yet o'erflowWith tenderness, like this.DUMNORIX.I never view'd theeFor the last time.VENUSIA.Look, look upon me stillWhy dost thou turn thy face away?DUMNORIX.For nothing.VENUSIA.Nay, thou art weeping, Dumnorix—and whereforeWouldst thou conceal thy tears?DUMNORIX.I cannot hide them.VENUSIA.And dost thou weep?DNMNORIX.I do.VENUSIA.Then didst thou love meWith such excess of fondness.—For VenusiaDo these soft streams bedew that awful face?DUMNORIX.Love thee! Behold, when Albion groans around me,Yet thou these springs of tenderness canst openTo wet the cheeks of British Dumnorix.VENUSIA.Oh! extacy! which stops my parting soul,And gives it vigour to enjoy these transports.Once more receive me to thy breast.DUMNORIX.Venusia!VENUSIA.Thy tenderness makes death delightful to me—Oh! I would speak—would answer to thy kindness—My fault'ring tongue—DUMNORIX.What sayst thou?VENUSIA.Cease to grieve—No pain molests me—ev'ry thought is calm—Support my drowsy burthen to that couch—Where death—serenely smiles.SCENE the fourteenth.FLAMINIUSspeaking to the Romans behind the Scene.My warlike friends,Keep back—our troops on ev'ry side advance.I cannot long controll them. Yet I trembleTo enter there—By heav'n he lives, and sees me.SCENE the fifteenth.FLAMINIUS and DUMNORIX with his sword drawn.DUMNORIX.Importunate Flaminius! Art thou comeTo rob my dying moments of their quiet?FLAMINIUS.Forgive the crime of ignorance—Forgive,Since accident hath join'd us once again,If strong compassion at thy fate yet pleads—DUMNORIX.What, when Venusia is no more?FLAMINIUS.No more!DUMNORIX.No; and be further lesson'd by a Briton,Who since his union with the best of womenHath never known an interval from love,And at this solemn pause yet melts in fondness:While death's black curtain shrouds my cold Venusia,Of dearer value doth my soul esteem her,Than should those eyes rekindle into lustre,And ev'ry charm revive with double pow'rOf winning beauty, if alone to shineAmid the gloom of bondage.FLAMINIUS.I will urgeNo more—farewel—our legions hover nigh.SCENE the sixteenth.DUMNORIX.Now in my breast resume thy wonted seat,Thou manly firmness, which so oft has borne meThrough ev'ry toil and danger. O return,Rise o'er my sorrow, and compleat thy last,Thy highest task, to close a life of glory—They come—Be swift, my sword—By thee to fall,Near that dear clay extended, best becomesA soldier's courage, and a husband's love.SCENE the last.AENOBARBUS, FLAMINIUS, and ROMANS.AENOBARBUS.To Boadicia's quarter I advanc'dAt thy request, who since her last defeat,Blind with despair and disappointed fury,Fled to her tent; expiring there I found herWith one ill-fated daughter, both by poison:Nor had the friendly Emmeline escap'd,But by the swift prevention of my hand.Dost thou not thank me, whose suggestion promptedOur quick return to seize the secret pass?Thou gav'st me freedom; love and fame repay thee.FLAMINIUS.If thou couldst add, that Dumnorix surviv'd?AENOBARBUSlooking into the tent.Thou seest, the Gods have otherwise decreed.Forbear to mingle vain regret with conquest.He hath done nobly. Fair befal his urn.
Death is his triumph, which a captive lifeHad forfeited to Rome, with all the praise,Now from the virtuous to his ashes due.FLAMINIUS.Then art thou fall'n at last, thou mighty tow'r,And more than Roman edifice of glory?See too Venusia, pale in death's embrace,Presents her faded beauties. Lovely ruin!Of ev'ry grace and virtue once the seat,The last kind office from my hand receive,Which shall unite thee to thy husband's side,And to one grave your mingling reliques trust.There soon a hallow'd monument shall rise.Insculptur'd laurel with the myrtle twin'd,The well-wrought stone adorning, shall proclaimHis gen'rous valour, and thy faithful love.End of the last act.EPILOGUE.Spoken by Mr. HAVARD.NOW we have shewn the fatal fruits of strife,A hero bleeding with a virtuous wife,A field of war embru'd with nation's gore,Which to the dust the hopes of Albion bore,If weak description, and the languid flowOf strains unequal to this theme of woeHave fail'd to move the sympathyzing breast,And no soft eyes their melting sense exprest;Not all the wit, this after scene might share,Can give success, where you refus'd a tear;Much less, if haply still the poet's artHath stol'n persuasive to the feeling heart.Will he with fancy's wanton hand effaceFrom gen'rous minds compassion's pleasing trace,Nor from their thoughts, while pensive they pursueThis maze of sorrow, snatch the moral clue:If yet to him those pow'rs of sacred songTo melt the heart and raise the mind belong.Dar'd he to hope, this sketch of early youthMight stand th'award of nature and of truth:Encourag'd thus, hereafter might he soarWith double strength, and loftier scenes explore,And following fortune through her various wiles,Shew struggling virtue, dress'd in tears, or smiles;Perhaps his grateful labours would rquiteWith frequent off'rings one propitious night.
