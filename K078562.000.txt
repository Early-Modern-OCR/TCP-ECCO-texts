LEONIDAS, A POEM.——PIND. OLYMP. OD. 1.LONDON: Printed for R. DODSLEY, at Tully's Head in Pallmall. M.DCC.XXXVII.THE PREFACE.TO illustrate the following poem, to vindicate the subject from the censure of improbability, and to shew by the concurring evidence of the best historians, that such disinterested public virtue did once exist, I have thought, it would not be improper to prefix the subsequent narration.WHILE Darius, the father of Xerxes, was yet on the throne of Persia, Cleomenes and Demaratus were kings in Lacedaemon, both descended from Hercules. Demaratus was unfortunately expos'd by an uncertain rumour, which render'd his legitimacy suspected, to the

malice and treachery of his colleague, who had conceiv'd a personal resentment against him; for Cleomenes taking advantage of this report, persuaded the Spartans to examine into the birth of Demaratus, and refer the difficulty to the oracle of Delphi; and was assisted in his perfidious designs by a near relation of Demaratus, nam'd Leotychides, who aspir'd to succeed him in his dignity. Cleomenes found means to corrupt the priestess of Delphi, who declar'd Demaratus not legitimate. Thus by the base practices of his colleague Cleomenes, and his kinsman Leotychides, Demaratus was expell'd from his office of king in the commonwealth, after having frequently signaliz'd his valour in its service. He went into voluntary banishment, and retiring to Asia was there protected by Darius; while Leotychides succeeded to the regal authority in Sparta. Upon the death of Cleomenes Leonidas was made king, who rul'd in conjunction with this Leotychides, when Xerxes, the son of Darius, invaded Greece. The

number of land and naval forces, which accompanied that monarch, together with the servants, women, and other usual attendants on the army of an eastern prince, amounted to upwards of five millions, as reported by Herodotus, who wrote within a few years after the event, and publicly recited his history at the Olympic games. In this general assembly not only from Greece itself, but from every part of the world, whereever a colony of Grecians was planted, had he greatly exceeded the truth, he must certainly have been detected, and censur'd by some among so great a multitude, and such a voluntary falshood must have entirely destroy'd that merit and authority, which have procur'd to Herodotus the veneration of all posterity, with the appellation of the father of history. On the first news of this attempt upon their liberty a convention was immediately held at the Isthmus of Corinth, compos'd of deputies from the several states of Greece, to consult on proper measures for the public safety. The Spartans

also sent messengers to enquire of the oracle at Delphi into the event of the war, who return'd with an answer from the priestess of Apollo, that either a king descended from Hercules must die, or Lacedaemon would be entirely destroy'd. Leonidas immediately offer'd to sacrifice his life for the safety of Lacedaemon, and marching to Thermopylae possess'd himself of that important pass with three hundred of his countrymen; who with the forces of some other cities in the Peloponnesus, together with the Thebans, Thespians, and the troops of those states, which adjoin'd to Thermopylae, compos'd an army of near eight thousand men.XERXES was now advanc'd as far, as Thessalia; when hearing, that a small body of Grecians was assembled at Thermopylae, with some Lacedaemonians at their head, and among the rest Leonidas, a descendant of Hercules, he dispatch'd a single horseman before to observe

their numbers, and discover their designs. When this horseman approach'd, he could not take a view of the whole camp, which lay conceal'd behind a rampart formerly rais'd by the Phocians at the entrance of Thermopylae; so that his whole attention was employ'd on those, who were on guard before the wall, and who at that instant chanc'd to be the Lacedaemonians. Their manner and gestures greatly astonish'd the Persian; some were amusing themselves in gymnastic exercises; others were combing their hair; and all discover'd a total disregard of him, whom they suffer'd to depart without molestation, and report to Xerxes, what he had seen: which appearing to that prince quite ridiculous, he sent for Demaratus, who was with him in the camp, and requir'd him to explain this strange behaviour of his countrymen. Demaratus inform'd him, that it was a custom among the Spartans to comb down and adjust their hair, when they were determin'd to fight till the last extremity. Xerxes notwithstanding

in the confidence of his power sent ambassadors to the Grecians to demand their arms, to bid them disperse, and become his friends and allies; which proposals being receiv'd with disdain, he commanded the Medes and Saces to seize on the Grecians, and bring them alive into his presence. These nations immediately attack'd the Grecians, and were soon repuls'd with great slaughter; fresh troops still succeeded, but with no better fortune than the first, being oppos'd to an enemy not only superiour in valour and resolution, but who had the advantage of discipline, and were furnish'd with better arms both offensive and defensive.PLUTARCH in his Laconic apothegms reports, that the Persian king offer'd to invest Leonidas with the sovereignty of all Greece, provided he would join his arms to those of Persia. This offer was too considerable a condescension to have been made before a tryal of their force, and must therefore have been propos'd by

Xerxes, after such a series of ill success, as might probably have depress'd the insolence of his temper; and it may be easily suppos'd, that the virtue of Leonidas was proof against any temptations of that nature. Whether this be a fact, or not, thus much is certain, that Xerxes was reduc'd to extreme difficulties by this resolute defence of Thermopylae; till he was extricated from his distress by a Malian nam'd Epialtes, who conducted twenty thousand of the Persian army into Greece through a pass, which lay higher up the country among the mountains of Oeta: whereas the passage at Thermopylae was situated on the sea-shore between the end of those mountains and the Malian bay. The defence of the upper pass had been committed to a thousand Phocians, who upon the first sight of the enemy inconsiderately abandon'd their station, and put themselves in array upon a neighbouring eminence; but the Persians wisely avoided an engagement, and with the utmost expedition march'd to Thermopylae. Leonidas

no sooner receiv'd information, that the Barbarians had pass'd the mountains, but he commanded the allies to retreat, reserving the three hundred Spartans, and four hundred Thebans, whom, as they follow'd him with reluctance at first, he now compell'd to stay. But the Thespians, whose number amounted to seven hundred, would not be persuaded by Leonidas to forsake him. Their commander was Demophilus, and the most eminent amongst them for his valour was Dithyrambus. Among the Spartans the most conspicuous next to Leonidas was Dieneces, who being told, that the multitude of Persian arrows would obscure the sun, replied, the battle would then be in the shade. Two brothers named Alpheus and Maron are also recorded for their valour, and were Lacedaemonians. Megistias a priest, by birth an Acarnanian, refus'd to desert Leonidas, though intreated by him to consult his safety, and retire; but sent away his only son, and remain'd himself behind to die with the Lacedaemonians. Among

the three hundred Spartans were two call'd Eurytus and Aristodemus, who being almost blind were dismiss'd by Leonidas. Of these Aristodemus return'd home; but Eurytus waited, till the Persians descended from the hills, and then commanding his slave to lead him among the combatants was slain with the rest of his countrymen.HERODOTUS relates, that Leonidas drew up his men in the broadest part of Thermopylae; where, being surrounded by the Persians, they fell with great numbers of their enemies: but Plutarch, Diodorus Siculus, and others affirm, that the Grecians attack'd the very camp of Xerxes in the night. The action is thus describ'd by Diodorus. "The Grecians having now rejected all thoughts of safety, preferring glory to life, unanimously call'd on their general to lead them against the Persians, before they could be appris'd, that their friends had pass'd round the mountains.

Leonidas embrac'd the occasion, which the ready zeal of his soldiers afforded, and commanded them forthwith to dine, as men, who were to sup in Elysium. Himself in consequence of this command took a repast, as the means to furnish strength for a long continuance, and to give perseverance in danger. After a short refreshment the Grecians were now prepar'd, and receiv'd orders to assail the enemies camp, to put all, they met, to the sword, and force a passage to the royal pavilion; when, form'd into one compact body with Leonidas himself at their head, they march'd against the Persians, and enter'd their camp at the dead of night. The Barbarians wholly unprepar'd, and blindly conjecturing, that their friends were defeated, and themselves attack'd by the united power of Greece, hurry together from their tents with the utmost disorder and consternation. Many were slain by Leonidas and his party, but much greater multitudes by their

own troops, to whom in the midst of this blind confusion they were not distinguishable from enemies: for as night took away the power of discerning truely, and the tumult was spread universally over the camp, a prodigious slaughter must naturally ensue. The want of command, of a watch-word, and of confidence in themselves reduc'd the Persians to such a state of confusion, that they destroy'd each other without distinction. Had Xerxes continu'd in the royal pavilion, the Grecians without difficulty might have brought the war to a speedy conclusion by his death; but he at the beginning of the tumult betook himself to flight with the utmost precipitation; when the Grecians rushing into the tent, put to the sword most of those, who were left behind: then, while night lasted, they rang'd through the whole camp in diligent search of the tyrant. When morning appear'd, the Persians perceiving the true state of things, held the inconsiderable

number of their enemies in contempt; yet were so terrified at their valour, that they avoided a near engagement; but inclosing the Grecians on every side shower'd their darts and arrows upon them at a distance, and in the end destroy'd their whole body. Such was the period of their lives, who under the conduct of Leonidas defended the pass of Thermopylae. Who can refrain from admiring the virtue of these men, who with one consent maintaining the post allotted by their country chearfully renounc'd their lives for the common safety of Greece, and esteem'd a glorious death more eligible than to live with dishonour? Nor is the consternation of the Persians incredible. Who among those Barbarians could have conjectur'd such an event? who could have expected, that five hundred men would have dar'd to attack a million? Wherefore shall not all posterity from that day reflect on the virtue of these men as the object of imitation, who, though the loss of

their lives was the necessary consequence of their undertaking, were yet unconquer'd in their spirit; and among all the great names deliver'd down to remembrance are the only heroes, who obtain'd more glory in their fall than others from the brightest victories? With justice may they be deem'd the preservers of the Grecian liberty, even preferably to those, who were conquerors in the battles fought afterwards with Xerxes; for the memory of their valour, who fell at Thermopylae, for ever dejected the Barbarians, while the Greeks were fir'd with emulation to equal such a pitch of magnanimity. Upon the whole there never were any before these, who attain'd to immortality through the meer excess of virtue; whence the praise of their fortitude has not been recorded by historians only, but has been celebrated by numbers of poets, among others by Simonides the lyric."
PAUSANIAS in his Laconics considers the defence of Thermopylae, as an action superior to any atchiev'd by their cotemporaries, and to all the exploits of preceding ages. "Never (says he) had Xerxes beheld Greece, or laid in ashes the city of Athens, had not his forces under Hydarnes been conducted through a path over Oeta, and by that means incompassing the Greeks overcome and slain Leonidas." Nor is it improbable, that Leonidas should have maintain'd his post in so narrow a pass, till the whole army of Xerxes had perish'd by famine. At the same time the Persian navy had been miserably shatter'd by a storm, and worsted in an engagement with the Athenians at Artemisium.To conclude, the fall of Leonidas and his brave companions, so meritorious to their country, and so glorious to themselves, has obtain'd such an high degree of veneration and applause

from past ages, that few among the antient compilers of history have been silent on this amazing instance of magnanimity and zeal for liberty; and many are the epigrams and inscriptions now extant, some on the whole body, others on particulars, who died at Thermopylae, still preserving their memory in every nation conversant with learning, and at this distance of time still rendring their virtue the object of admiration and praise.I SHALL now detain the reader no longer, than to take this public occasion of expressing my sincere regard for the LORD VISCOUNT COBHAM, and the sense of my obligations for the early honour of his friendship. To him I inscribe the following poem; and herein might I be justified, independent of all personal motives, from his Lordship's public conduct so highly distinguish'd by his disinterested zeal, and unshaken fidelity to his country, not less in civil life

than in the field: and to whom a poem founded on a character eminent for military glory, and love of liberty is due from the nature of the subject.R. GLOVER.LEONIDAS.BOOK I.The argument.Xerxes king of Persia having drawn together the whole force of his empire, and pass'd over the Hellespont into Thrace with a design to conquer Greece; the deputies from the several states of that country, who had some time before assembled themselves at the Isthmus of Corinth to deliberate on proper measures for resisting the invader, were no sooner appris'd of his march into Thrace, than they determin'd without further delay to dispute his passage at the straits of Thermopylae, the most accessible part of Greece on the side of Thrace and Thessaly. Alpheus, one of the deputies from Sparta, repairs to that city, and communicates this resolution to his countrymen; who chanced that day to be assembled in expectation of receiving an answer from Apollo, to whom they had sent a messenger to consult about the event of the war. Leotychides, one of their two kings, counsels the people to advance no further, than the Isthmus of Corinth, which separates the Peloponnesus, where Lacedaemon was situated, from the rest of Greece; but Leonidas, the other king, dissuades them from it. Agis, the messenger, who had

been deputed to Delphi, and brother to the queen of Leonidas, returns with the oracle; which denounces ruin to the Lacedaemonians, unless one of their kings lays down his life for the publick. Leonidas offers himself for the victim. Three hundred Spartans are chosen to accompany him to Thermopylae, and Alpheus returns to the Isthmus. Leonidas, after an interview with his queen, departs from Lacedaemon. At the end of six days, he encamps near the Isthmus, when he is join'd by Alpheus; who describes the auxiliaries, that wait at the Isthmus, those, who are already possess'd of Thermopylae, as also the pass itself; and concludes with a relation of the captivity of his brother Polydorus in Persia.REHEARSE, O Muse, the deeds and glorious deathOf that fam'd Spartan, who withstood the pow'rOf Xerxes near Thermopylae, and fellTo save his country. When from Asia's coastWith half the nations of the peopled globeThe Persian king the Hellespont had pass'd,And now in Thrace his boundless camp was spread;Soon to the Isthmus, where th'assembled chiefsOf Greece in anxious council long had sat,How best their menac'd liberties to guard,
The dreadful tidings reach'd. The near approachOf Asia's lord determines their resolves.These they convey to all the Grecian states.Back to Eurotas' shores, where Sparta rose,Laconian Alpheus speeds: in council thereHe finds the Spartan people with their kings;Their kings, who boast an origin divine,From Hercules descended. They the sonsOf Lacedaemon had conven'd to learnThe sacred mandates of th' immortal Gods,That morn expected from the Delphian dome;But in their presence Alpheus first appear'd,And thus address'd them. For immediate warPrepare, O Spartans. Xerxes' num'rous pow'rsAlready fill the trembling bounds of Thrace.The Isthmian council hath decreed to guardThe strait and rocky entrance into Greece,
Thermopylae; where ev'n a slender forceMay stem the torrent of unnumber'd foes.HE said, when Leotychides, who shar'dThe rule with great Leonidas, bespakeThe Spartans thus. My countrymen give ear.Why from her bosom should Laconia sendHer valiant sons to wage a distant warFor others' safety; why exhaust her strengthAnd thin her numbers in defence of those,Who far remote from Lacedaemon dwellBeyond the Isthmus? there the Gods have plac'dOur native ramparts, there our empire's bound;And there alone our country claims our swords.HE ceas'd. The people with assenting shoutsReplied, when thus Leonidas began.O MOST ungen'rous counsel! most unjust,And base desertion of the Grecian weal!What! shall th'Athenians, whose assiduous fleetsUndaunted watch th' innumerable foes,Where'er they menace our affrighted shores,And trust th' impending dangers of the fieldTo Sparta's well-known valour; shall they hear,That we, disowning thus the gen'ral cause,Maintain the Isthmus only, and exposeThe rest of Greece, ev'n Athens, while she guardsOur naked coasts, to all the waste of war,Her walls to ruin, and her fields to flames,Her sons, her matrons, and her hoary siresTo violation, servitude, and shame?O should they hear such counsels guide our state,Would they not court the first propitious gale
To waft them far from such perfidious friends,And raise new seats in other climes remote,Safe from insulting foes, and false allies?Then should we soon behold the proud arrayOf Xerxes' navy with their hostile beaksAffront our shores, and deluge all our fieldsWith inexhausted numbers. Half the Greeks,By us betray'd to bondage, would supportThe Persian king, and lift th' avenging spearFor our destruction. But my friends rejectSuch mean and dang'rous counsels, which will blastYour long establish'd glories, and assistThe proud invader. O eternal kingOf Gods and mortals elevate our minds!Each low and partial passion thence dispel!Till this great truth in ev'ry heart be known,That none, but those, who aid the publick cause,
Can shield their countries, or themselves from chains.HE said, by shame suppress'd each clam'rous voiceWas lost in silence; till a gen'ral shoutProclaim'd th' approach of Agis from the fane,Where, taught by Phoebus on the Delphic hill,The Pythian maid his oracles reveal'd.He came; but discontent and grief o'ercastHis anxious brow. Reluctant he advanc'd,And now prepar'd to speak. Th' impatient throngWas gather'd round him; motionless they stoodWith expectation; not a whisper toldThe silent fear, but all on Agis gaze;And still as death attend the solemn tale.As o'er the western waves, when ev'ry stormIs hush'd within its cavern, and a breezeSoft-breathing lightly with its wings along
The slacken'd cordage glides, the sailor's earPerceives no sound throughout the vast expanse;None, but the murmurs of the sliding prowe,Which slowly parts the smooth and yielding main:So through the wide and listning croud no sound,No voice, but thine, O Agis, broke the air,Declaring thus the oracle divine.I WENT to Delphi; I enquir'd what fateWas doom'd to Sparta from th'impending war;When thus th' all-seeing deity replied."Inhabitants of Sparta, Persia's arms"Shall lay your proud and ancient seat in dust;"Unless a king from Hercules deriv'd"Cause Lacedaemon for his death to mourn."AS, when the hand of Perseus had disclos'dThe snakes of dirc Medusa; all, who view'd
The Gorgon features, were congeal'd to stone,With ghastly eye-balls on the hero bent,And horrour living in their marble form:Thus with amazement rooted, where they stood,And froze with speechless terrour, on their kingsThe Spartans gaz'd: but soon their anxious looksAll on the great Leonidas unite,Long known his country's refuge. He aloneRemains unshaken. Rising, he displaysHis godlike presence. Dignity and graceAdorn his frame, and manly beauty join'dWith strength Herculean. On his aspect shinesSublimest virtue, and desire of fame,Where justice gives the laurel; in his eyeThe inextinguishable spark, which firesThe souls of patriots: while his brow supports
Undaunted valour, and contempt of death.Serene he rose, and thus address'd the throng.WHY this astonishment on ev'ry face,Ye men of Sparta? Does the name of deathCreate this fear and wonder? O my friends!Why do we labour through the arduous paths,Which lead to virtue? Fruitless were the toil,Above the reach of human feet were plac'dThe distant summit, if the fear of deathCould intercept our passage. But in vainHis blackest frowns and terrours he assumesTo shake the firmness of the mind, which knows,That wanting virtue life is pain and woe,That wanting liberty ev'n virtue mourns,And looks around for happiness in vain.Then speak, O Sparta, and demand my life;
My heart exulting answers to thy call,And smiles on glorious fate. To live with fameThe Gods allow to many; but to dieWith equal lustre, is a blessing, Heav'nSelects from all the choicest boons of fate,And with a sparing hand on few bestows.HE said. New wonder fix'd the gazing throng.In silence Joy and Admiration sat,Suspending praise. At length with high acclaimThe arch of heav'n resounded, when amidTh' assembly stood Dieneces, and spake.SO from Thermopylae may Sparta's shoutsAffright the ear of Asia! Haste, my friends,To guard the gates of Greece, which open standTo Tyranny and Rapine. They with dread
Will shrink before your standards, and againIn servile Persia seek their native seats.Your wives, your sons, your parents, general GreeceForbid delay; and equal to the causeA chief behold: can Spartans ask for more?HE ceas'd; when Alpheus thus. It well becomesThe Spartans held the chiefs of Greece, and fam'dFor dauntless courage, and unyielding hearts,Which neither want, nor pain, nor death, can bend,To lead the rest to battle. Then with speedFrom all your number form a chosen band,While I returning, will my seat resumeAmong the Isthmian council, and declareYour instant march. Our brave allies, I deem,Now on the Isthmus wait the Spartan king;All but the Locrian and Boeotian force,
With Phocis' youth, appointed to secureThermopylae. This said, not long he paus'd,But with unwearied steps his course renews.NOW from th' assembly with majestic stepsForth moves their godlike king, with conscious worthHis gen'rous bosom glowing; like his sire,Th' invincible Alcides, when he trodWith ardent speed to face in horrid warThe triple form of Geryon, or againstThe bulk of huge Antaeus match his strength.SAY, Muse, who next present their dauntless breastsTo meet all danger in their country's cause?Dieneces advances sage, and brave,And skill'd along the martial field to rangeThe order'd ranks of battle; Maron next,
To Alpheus dear, his brother, and his friend.Then rose Megistias with his blooming heir,Joy of his age, and Menalippus call'd;Megistias, wise and venerable seer,Whose penetrating mind, as fame records,Could from the entrails of the victim slainBefore the altar, and the mystic flightOf birds foresee the dark events of time.Though sprung a stranger on the distant shoreOf Acarnania, for his worth receiv'd,And hospitably cherish'd; he the wreathPontific bore amid the Spartan camp;Serene in danger, nor his sacred armFrom warlike toils secluding, nor unskill'dTo wield the sword, or poize the weighty spear.Him Agis follow'd, brother to the queenOf great Leonidas; his friend, in war
His tried companion. Graceful were his steps,And gentle his demeanour. Still his soulPreserv'd its rigid virtue, though refin'dWith arts unknown to Lacedaemon's race.High was his office. He, when Sparta's wealTheir aid and counsel from the Gods requir'd,Was sent the sacred messenger to learnTheir mystic will in oracles declar'dFrom rocky Delphi, and Dodona's shade,Or sea-incircled Delos, or the cellOf dark Trophonius round Boeotia known.Three hundred more compleat th' intrepid band.BUT to his home Leonidas retir'd.There calm in secret thought he thus explor'dHis mighty soul, while nature to his breastA short-liv'd terrour call'd. What sudden grief,
What cold reluctance thus unmans my heart,And whispers, that I fear?—Can death dismayLeonidas, so often seen and scorn'd,When clad most dreadful in the battle's front?—Or to relinquish life in all its pride,With all my honours blooming round my head,Repines my soul? or rather to forsake,Eternally forsake my weeping wife,My infant offspring, and my faithful friends?—Leonidas awake! Shall these withstandThe public safety? Lo! thy country calls.O sacred voice, I hear thee! At that soundReturning virtue brightens in my heart;Fear vanishes before her; Death receiveMy unreluctant hand, and lead me on.Thou too, O Fame, attendant on my fall,
With wings unwearied shalt protect my tomb,Nor Time himself shall violate my praise.THE hero thus confirm'd his virtuous soul,When Agis enter'd. If till now my tongue(He thus began) O brother, has delay'dTo pay its grateful off'ring of the praise,Thy merit claims, and only fill'd the criesOf general applause, forgive thy friend;Since her distresses, hers, whom most you love,Detain'd me from thee. O unequall'd man!Though Lacedaemon call thy first regard,Forget not her, who now for thee lamentsIn sorrows, which fraternal love in vainHath strove to sooth. Leonidas embrac'dHis gen'rous friend, and thus replied. Most dearAnd best of men! conceive not, but my heart
Must still remember her, from whom my lifeIts largest share of happiness derives.Can I, who yield my breath, lest others mourn,Lest thousands should be wretched; when she pines,More lov'd than any, though less dear than all,Can I neglect her griefs! In future daysIf thou with grateful memory recordMy name and fate, O Sparta, pass not thisUnheeded by. The life, I gave for thee,Knew not a painful hour to tire my soul,Nor were they common joys, I left behind.SO spake the patriot, and his heart o'erflow'dWith fondest passion; then in eager hasteThe faithful partner of his bed he sought.Amid her weeping children sat the queen,Immoveable and mute; her swimming eyes
Fix'd on the earth. Her arms were folded o'erHer lab'ring bosom blotted with her tears.As, when a dusky mist involves the sky,The moon through all the dreary vapours spreadsThe radiant vesture of its silver lightO'er the dull face of nature; so her charmsDivinely graceful shone upon her grief,Bright'ning the cloud of woe. The chief approach'd.Soon as in gentlest phrase his well-known voiceHer drooping mind awaken'd, for a timeIts cares were hush'd: she lifts her languid head,And thus gives utt'rance to her tender thoughts.O THOU, whose presence is my only joy,If thus, Leonidas, thy looks and voiceCan dissipate at once the sharpest pangs,How greatly am I wretched; who no more
Must hear that voice, which lulls my anguish thus,Nor see that face, which makes affliction smile!THIS said, returning grief her breast invades.Her orphan children, her devoted lordPale, bleeding, breathless on the field of death,Her ever-during solitude of woe,All rise in mingled horrour to her sight,When thus in bitt'rest agony she spoke.O WHITHER art thou going from my arms!Shall I no more behold thee! Oh! no moreIn conquest clad, and wrapt in glorious dustWilt thou return to greet thy native soil,And make thy dwelling joyfull Yet, too brave,Why wouldst thou hasten to the dreary gatesOf death, uncall'd? Another might have fall'n,
Like thee a victim of Alcides' race,Less dear to all, and Sparta been secure.Now ev'ry eye with mine is drown'd in tears,All with these babes lament their father lost.But oh! how heavy is our lot of pain!Our sighs must last, when ev'ry other breastExults with transport, and the public joyWill but increase our anguish. Yet unmov'd,Thou didst not heed our sorrows, didst not seekA moment's pause, to teach us how to bearThy endless absence, or like thee to die.UNUTTERABLE sorrow here confin'dHer voice. These words Leonidas return'd.I SEE, I feel thy anguish, nor my soulHas ever known the prevalence of love,E'er prov'd a father's fondness, as this hour;
Nor, when most ardent to assert my fame,Was once my heart insensible to thee.How had it stain'd the honours of my nameTo hesitate a moment, and suspendMy country's fate, till shameful life prefer'dBy my inglorious colleague left no choice,But what in me were infamy to shun,Not virtue to accept? Then deem no more,That of thy love regardless, or thy tears,I haste uncall'd to death. The voice of Fate,The Gods, my fame, my country bid me bleed.—Oh! thou dear mourner! wherefore streams afreshThat flood of woe? Why heaves with sighs renew'dThat tender breast? Leonidas must fall.Alas! far heavier misery impendsO'er thee and these, if soften'd by thy tearsI shamefully refuse to yield that breath,
Which justice, glory, liberty, and heav'nClaim for my country, for my sons, and thee.Think on my long unalter'd love. ReflectOn my paternal fondness. Has my heartE'er known a pause of love, or pious care?Now shall that care, that tenderness be prov'dMost warm and faithful. When thy husband dies.For Lacedaemon's safety, thou wilt share,Thou and thy children, the diffusive good.Should I, thus singled from the rest of men,Alone intrusted by th 'immortal GodsWith pow'r to save a people, should my soulDesert that sacred cause, thee too I yieldTo sorrow, and to shame; for thou must weepWith Lacedaemon, must with her sustainThy painful portion of oppression's weight.Thy sons behold now worthy of their names,
And Spartan birth. Their growing bloom must pineIn shame and bondage, and their youthful heartsBeat at the sound of liberty no more.On their own virtue, and their father's fame,When he the Spartan freedom hath confirm'd,Before the world illustrious shall they rise,Their country's bulwark, and their mother's joy.HERE paus'd the patriot. With religious aweGrief heard the voice of Virtue. No complaintThe solemn silence broke. Tears ceas'd to flow:Ceas'd for a moment; soon again to stream.For now in arms before the palace rang'dHis brave companions of the war demandTheir leader's presence; then her griefs renew'd,Too great for utt'rance, intercept her sighs,And freeze each accent on her falt'ring tongue.
In speechless anguish on the hero's breastShe sinks. On ev'ry side his children press,Hang on his knees, and kiss his honour'd hand.His soul no longer struggles to confineIts strong compunction. Down the hero's cheek,Down flows the manly sorrow. Great in woeAmid his children, who inclose him round,He stands indulging tenderness and loveIn graceful tears; when thus with lifted eyesAddress'd to heav'n: Thou ever-living pow'rLook down propitious, sire of Gods and men!And to this faithful woman, whose desertMay claim thy favour, grant the hours of peace.And thou, my great forefather, son of Jove,O Hercules, neglect not these thy race!But since that spirit, I from thee derive,Now bears me from them to resistless fate,
Do thou support their virtue! be they taught,Like thee, with glorious labour life to grace,And from their father let them learn to die!SO saying, forth he issues, and assumesBefore the band his station of command.They now proceed. So mov'd the host of heav'nDown from Olympus in majestic march,On Jove attendant to the flaming plainsOf Phlegra, there to face the giant sonsOf Earth and Titan: he before them tow'r'd.Thus through the streets of Lacedaemon pass'dLeonidas. Before his footsteps bowThe multitude exulting. On he treadsRever'd and honour'd. Their inraptur'd sightPursues his graceful stature, and their tonguesExtol and hail him as their guardian God.
Firm in his nervous hand he grasps his spear.Down from his shoulders to his ankles hangsThe massy shield, and o'er his burnish'd helmThe purple plumage nods. Harmonious youths,Around whose brows entwining laurels play'd,In lofty-sounding strains his praise record;While snowy-finger'd virgins all the waysWith od'rous garlands strew'd. His bosom nowWas all possess'd with glory, which dispell'dWhate'er of grief remain'd, or fond regretFor those, he left behind. The rev'rend trainOf Lacedaemon's senate now approach'dTo give their solemn, last farewel, and graceTheir hero's parting steps. Around him flow'dIn civil pomp their venerable robesMix'd with the blaze of arms. The radiant troopOf warriours press'd behind him. Maron here,
With Menalippus warm in flow'ry prime,And Agis there with manly grace advanc'd,Dieneces, and Acarnania's seer,Megistias sage. The Spartan dames ascendThe loftiest domes, and thronging o'er the roofsGaze on their sons and husbands, as they march.So parted Argo from th' Iolchian strand,And plough'd the foaming surge. Thessalia's nymphsTheir hills forsaking, and their hallow'd groves,Rang'd on the cliffs, which overshade the deep,Still on the distant vessel fix'd their sight;Where Greece her chosen heroes had embark'dTo seek the dangers of the Cholchian shore.SWIFT on his course Leonidas proceeds.Soon is Eurotas pass'd, and Lerna's banks,Where his unconquer'd ancestor subdu'd
The many-headed Hydra, and with fameImmortaliz'd the lake. Th'unwearied bandsNext through the pines of Maenalus he led,And down Parthenius urg'd the rapid toil.Six days incessant thus the Spartans march,When now they hear the hoarse-resounding tideBeat on the Isthmus. Here their tents they spread.Below the wide horizon then the sunHad sunk his beamy head. The queen of nightGleam'd from the center of th'ethereal vault,And o'er the dusky robe of darkness shedHer silver light. Leonidas detainsDieneces and Agis. Open standsThe tall pavilion, and admits the moon.As here they sat conversing, from the hill,Which rose before them, one of noble portAppears with speed descending. Lightly down
The slope he treads, and calls aloud. They heard,And knew the voice of Alpheus. From their seatsThey rose, and thus Leonidas began.O THOU, whom heav'n with swiftness hath endu'dTo match the ardour of thy daring soul,What calls thee from the Isthmus? Do the GreeksNeglect to arm, nor face the public foe?I COME to meet thee (Alpheus thus return'd)A messenger, who gladsome tidings bears.Through Greece the voice of liberty is heard,And all unfold their banners in her cause;The Thebans only with reluctant hands.Arcadia's sons with morning shalt thou join,Who on the Isthmus wait thy great command.With Diophantus Mantinéa sendsFive hundred spears; nor less from Tegea's walls
With Hegesander move. A thousand more,Who in Orchomenus reside, who rangeAlong Parrhasius, and Cyllene's brow,Or near the foot of Erymanthus dwell,Or on Alphéus' banks, with various chiefs,Attend thy call; but most is Clonius fam'dOf stature huge: unshaken as a rock,His giant bulk the line of war sustains.Four hundred warriours brave Alcmaeon drawsFrom stately Corinth's tow'rs. Two hundred marchFrom Phlius, whom Eupalamus commands.An equal number of Mycenae's raceAristobulus heads. Through fear aloneOf thee, and threatning Greece the Thebans arm.To these inglorious Greeks my self repair'dTheir dying sense of honour to recal.A few corrupted by the Persian gold,
Unjust dominion have usurp'd in Thebes.These in each bosom quell the gen'rous flameOf liberty. The eloquent they bribe;With specious tales the multitude they cheat;And prostitute the name of public goodTo veil oppression. Others are immers'dIn all the sloth of riches, and unmov'dIn shameful ease behold their country fall.I first implor'd their senate's instant aid,But they with artful wiles demanding timeFor consultation, I address'd them thus.The shortest moment may suffice to know,If to die free be better than to serve;But if, deluding Greece by vain delays,You mean to shew your friendship to the foe,You cannot then deliberate too long,How to withstand her swift-avenging wrath,
Approaching with Leonidas. This heard,Four hundred warriours they appoint to march.The wily Anaxander is their chief,With Leontiades. I saw their marchBegun, then hasten'd to survey the straits,Which thou shalt render sacred to renown.Where, ever mingling with the crumbling soil,Which moulders round the Malian bay, the seaIn slimy surges rolls; upon the rock,Which forms the utmost limit of the bay,Thermopylae is stretch'd. Where broadest spread,It measures threescore paces, bounded hereBy the deep ooze, which underneath presentsIts dreary surface; there the lofty cliffsOf woody Oeta overlook the pass,And far beyond o'er half the surge belowTheir horrid umbrage cast. Across the straits
An ancient bulwark of the Phocians stands,A wall with turrets crown'd. In station hereI found the Locrians, and from Thespia's gatesSev'n hundred more Demophilus hath led.His brother's son attends him to the camp,Young Dithyrambus greatly fam'd in war,But more for temperance of mind renown'd;Lov'd by his country, and with honours grac'd,His early bloom with brightest glory shines,Nor wantons in the blaze. Here Agis spake.WELL hast thou painted that illustrious youth.He was my host at Thespia. Though adorn'dWith highest deeds, by fame and fortune crown'd,His gentle virtues take from envy's mouthIts blasting venom, and her baneful face
Strives on his worth to smile. In silence allAgain remain, and Alpheus thus pursues.A CHOSEN troop hath bold Plataea sent,Small in its numbers, but unmatch'd in arms.Above the rest Diomedon their chiefExcels in prowess. Signal were his deedsUpon that day of glory, when the fieldsOf Marathon were hid with Persian slain.These guard Thermopylae. Among the hillsA winding path to stranger's feet unknownAffords another entrance into Greece:This by a thousand Phocians is secur'd.HERE Alpheus paus'd. Leonidas embrac'dThe noble Spartan, and rejoin'd. Thou know'stWhat fate to me th' immortal Gods ordain.
Frame now thy choice. Accompany our march,Or go to Lacedaemon, and relate,How thy discerning mind, and active limbsHave serv'd thy country. From th' impatient mouthOf Alpheus streight these fervent accents broke.I HAVE not measur'd such a tract of land,Not look'd unwearied on the setting sun,And through the shade of midnight urg'd my stepsTo rouse the Greeks to battle, that myselfMight be exempted from the glorious toil.Return? Oh! no. A second time my feetShall visit thee, Thermopylae, and thereWith great Leonidas shall Alpheus findAn honourable grave. And oh! amidHis country's danger if a Spartan breastMay feel a private sorrow, not alone
For injur'd Greece I hasten to revenge,But for a brother's wrongs. A younger hopeThan I, or Maron bless'd our father's years,Child of his age, and Polydorus nam'd.His mind, while tender in its op'ning prime,Was bent to rigid virtue. Gen'rous scornOf pain and danger taught his early strengthTo struggle patient with severest toils.Oft, when inclement winter chill'd the air,And frozen show'rs had swoln Eurotas' stream,Amid th' impetuous channel would he plunge,And breast the torrent. On a fatal day,As in the sea his active limbs he bath'd,A servile corsair of the Persian kingMy brother, naked and defenceless, boreEv'n in my sight to Asia, there to waste,With all the promise of its growing worth,
His youth in bondage. Never can my tongueMy pains recount, much less my father's woes,The days he wept, the sleepless nights he beatHis aged bosom. And shall Alpheus' spearBe absent from Thermopylae, nor claim,O Polydorus, vengeance for thy bondsIn that first slaughter of the barb'rous foe?HERE interpos'd Dieneces. The handsOf Alpheus and Leonidas he grasp'd,And joyful thus. Your glory wants no more,Than that Lycurgus should himself ariseTo praise the virtue, which his laws inspire.THUS pass'd these heroes, till the dead of night,The hours in friendly converse, and enjoy'dEach other's virtue; happiest of men!
At length with gentle heaviness the handOf sleep invades their eyelids. On the ground,Oppress'd with slumber, they extend their limbs;When, sliding down the hemisphere, the moonNow plung'd in midnight gloom her silver head.End of the First Book.LEONIDAS. BOOK II.The argument.Leonidas, on his approach to the Isthmus, is met by the leaders of the troops sent from other Grecian states, and by the deputies, who compos'd the Isthmian council. He harangues them, then proceeds in conjunction with the other forces towards Thermopylae; is join'd by Dithyrambus, and arrives at the straits about noon on the fourth day after his departure from the Isthmus. He is receiv'd at Thermopylae by the Thespian commander Demophilus, and by Anaxander the Theban treacherously recommending Epialtes a Malian, who seeks by a pompous description of the Persian power to intimidate the Grecian leaders, as they are viewing the enemies camp from the top of mount Oeta. He is answer'd by Dieneces and Diomedon. Xerxes sends Tigranes and Phraortes to the Grecian camp, who are dismiss'd by Leonidas, and conducted back by Dithyrambus and Diomedon; which last, incens'd with the insolence of Tigranes, treats him with contempt and menaces. This occasions a challenge to single combat between Diomedon and Tigranes, Dithyrambus and Phraortes. Epialtes, after a conference with Anaxander, declares his intention of returning to Xerxes.AURORA spread her purple beams around,When mov'd the Spartans. Their approach is known.The Isthmian council, and the various chiefs,Who led th' auxiliar bands, proceed to meetLeonidas; Eupalamus the strong,Alcmaeon, Clonius, Diophantus brave,And Hegesander. At their head advanc'dAristobulus, whom Mycenae's youthAttend to war; Mycenae once elateWith pow'r and dazzling wealth, and vaunting stillThe name of Agamemnon, who alongThe seas of Asia open'd to the windUnnumber'd sails, and darken'd half the shoreOf trembling Phrygia with the hostile shade.Aristobulus join'd the Spartan king,And thus began. Leonidas survey
Mycenae's race. Should ev'ry other GreekBe aw'd by Xerxes, and his Asian host,Believe not, we can fear, deriv'd from those,Who once conducted o'er the foaming surgeThe strength of Greece, who desert left the fieldsOf ravag'd Asia, and her proudest wallsFrom their foundations humbled to the dust.LEONIDAS replied not, but address'dThe chiefs around. Illustrious warriours hail,Who thus undaunted signalize your faith,And gen'rous ardour in the common cause.But you, whose counsels prop the Grecian state,O venerable synod, whose decreesHave call'd us forth, to vanquish, or to die,Thrice hail. Whate'er by valour we obtainYour wisdom must preserve. With piercing eyes
Each Grecian state contemplate, and discernTheir various tempers. Some with partial careTo guard their own neglect the publick weal.Cold and unmov'd are others. Terrour here,And there corruption reigns. O fire the braveWith gen'rous zeal to quit their native walls,And join their valour in the gen'ral cause;Confirm the wav'ring; animate the cold,And watch the faithless: some there are, betrayThemselves and Greece; their perfidy prevent,Or call them back to honour. Let us allBe link'd in sacred union, and the GreeksShall stand the world's whole multitude in arms.If for the spoil, which Paris bore to Troy,A thousand barks the Hellespont o'erspread;Shall not again confederated GreeceBe rous'd to battle, and to freedom give,
What once she gave to fame. Behold we hasteTo stop th' invading tyrant. Till we bleed,He shall not pour his millions on your plains.But as the Gods conceal, how long our strengthMay stand unconquer'd, or how soon must fall,Waste not a moment, till consenting GreeceRange all her free-born numbers in the field.LEONIDAS concludes, when awful step'dBefore the sage assembly one, whose headWas hoar with aged snow, and thus replied.THY great example ev'ry heart unites.From thee her happiest omens Greece derivesOf concord, freedom, victory, and fame.Go then, O first of mortals, and impressAmaze and terrour in the Persians breast;
The free-born Greeks instructing life to deemLess dear than virtue, and their country's cause.THIS heard, Leonidas, thy secret soulExulting tasted of the sweet rewardDue to thy name from endless time. His eyesOnce more he turn'd, and view'd in rapt'rous thoughtHis native land, which he alone can save;Then summon'd all his majesty, and o'erThe Isthmus trod. Behind the Grecians moveIn deep arrangement. So th' imperial barkWith stately bulk along the beating tideIn military pomp conducts the pow'rOf some proud navy bounding from the portTo bear the vengeance of a mighty stateAgainst a tyrant's walls. The Grecians marchTill noon, when halting, as they take repast,
Upon the plain before them they descryA troop of Thespians. One above the restIn eminence precedes. His glitt'ring shield,Whose spacious orb collects th' effulgent beams,Which from his throne meridian Phoebus cast,Flames like another sun. A snowy plumeFalls o'er his dazzling cask. In wanton curls,Which floated in the breathing air, aroundThe lofty crest it wav'd. Approaching nearBeneath the honours of his radiant helmThe warriour now a countenance display'd,Where youth in rosy prime with sweetness mix'dIts manly beauty. With such modest graceRespectful near Leonidas he came,As all ideas of his own desertWere lost in veneration. Phoebus thusAppears before his everlasting sire,
When from his altar in th' imbow'ring groveOf palmy Delos, or the hallow'd boundOf Tenedos, or Claros, where he hearsHis hymns and praises from the sons of men,He reascends the high Olympian seats;Such reverential awe his brow invests,Diffusing o'er the glowing flow'r of youthNew loveliness and grace. The king receivesTh' illustrious Thespian, and began. My tongueWould call thee Dithyrambus, for thou bear'stAll in thy aspect to become that nameFor valour known and virtue. O revealThy birth and charge; whoe'er thou art, my soulDesires to know thee, and would call thee friend.TO whom the youth return'd. O first of Greeks,My name is Dithyrambus, which the lips
Of some benevolent and gen'rous friendTo thee have sounded with a partial voice,And thou hast heard with favourable ears.I come deputed by the Thespian chief,The Theban, and the Locrian, and the braveDiomedon, to hasten thy approach.Three days will bring the Persian pow'rs in view.HE ceas'd. At once the standards are uprear'd.The host till ev'ning with impetuous paceTheir march continue. Through the earliest dewsOf morning they proceed, and reach the pass,E'er the fourth sun attain'd the sult'ry noon.To their impatient sight no sooner roseThe rocks of Oeta, but with rapid feet,And martial sounds of joy they rush'd along;As if the present deity of Fame,
Her temples with unfading laurels bound,And in her hand her adamantine trump,Had from the hills her radiant form disclos'd,And bade their valour hasten to the field;That she their acts beholding might resoundTheir name and glory o'er the earth and seas.Before the van Leonidas advanc'd,His eye confess'd the ardour of his mind,Which thus found utt'rance from his eager lips.ALL hail! Thermopylae, and you, the pow'rs,Which here preside. All hail! ye silvan Gods,Ye fountain nymphs, who pour your lucid rillsIn broken murmurs down the rugged steep.Receive us, O benignant, and supportThe cause of Greece. Conceal the secret paths,Which o'er the crags and through the forests wind,
Untrod by human feet, and trac'd aloneBy your immortal footsteps. O defendYour own recesses, nor let impious warProfane the solemn silence of your groves.Thus on your hills your praises shall you hearFrom those, whose deeds shall tell th' approving world,That not to undeservers did you grantYour high protection. You my valiant friendsNow rouse the gen'rous spirit, which inflamesYour breasts; now prove the vigour of your arms:That your recorded actions may surviveWithin the breasts of all the brave and free,And sound delightful in the ear of Time,As long as Neptune beats the Malian bay,Or those tall cliffs erect their shaggy topsSo near to heav'n, your monuments of fame.As in some torrid region, where the headOf Ceres bends beneath its golden load,If on the parching ground a fatal sparkFall from a burning brand; the sudden blazeIncreas'd and aided by tumultuous windsIn rapid torrents of involving flamesSweeps o'er the crackling plain, and mounting highIn ruddy spires illumines half the skies:Not with less swiftness through the glowing ranksThe words of great Leonidas diffus'dA more than mortal fervour. Ev'ry heartDistends with great ideas, such as raiseThe patriot's virtue, and the soldier's fire,When danger in its most tremendous formSeems to their eyes most lovely. In their thoughtsImagination pictures all the scenes
Of war, the purple field, the heaps of death,And glitt'ring trophies pil'd with Persian arms.BUT now the Grecian leaders, who beforeWere station'd near Thermopylae, accostThe Spartan king. The Thespian chief alliedTo Dithyrambus first the silence broke,An ancient warriour. From behind his casque,Whose crested weight his aged temples press'd,His slender hairs, which time had silver'd o'er,Flow'd venerable down. He thus began.JOY now shall crown the period of my days.And whether with my father's dust I sleep,Or slain by Persia's sword I press the earthOur common parent, be it as the GodsShall best determine. For the present hourI bless their bounty, which has giv'n my age
To see the great Leonidas, and bidThe hero welcome on this glorious shore;Where he by heav'n selected from mankindShall fix the basis of the Grecian weal.HERE too the wily Anaxander spake.Hail! glorious chief. Of all the Theban raceWe shall at least with gladsome bosoms meetThe great defender of the Grecian cause.O! may oblivion o'er the shame of ThebesIts darkest wing extend, or they aloneBe curs'd by Fame, whose impious counsels turnTheir countrymen from virtue. Thebes alas!Still had been buried in dishonest sloth,Had not to wake her languor Alpheus comeThe messenger of freedom. O acceptOur grateful hearts; thou, Alpheus, art the cause,
That Anaxander from his native gatesHere hath not borne a solitary spear,Nor these inglorious in their walls remain'd.But longer do we loiter? Haste my friendsTo yonder cliff, which points its shade afar,And view the Persian camp. The morning sunBeheld their numbers hide th' adjacent plains.Lo! here a Malian, Epialtes nam'd,Who with the foe from Thracia's bounds hath march'd.HE said. His seeming virtue all deceiv'd.The camp not long had Epialtes join'd,By race a Malian. Eloquent his tongue,But false his heart, and abject. He was skill'dTo grace perfidious counsels, and to cloathIn swelling phrase the baseness of his soul,Foul nurse of treasons. To the tents of Greece,
Himself a Greek, a faithless spy he came.Soon to the friends of Xerxes he repair'd,The Theban chiefs, and nightly consult held,How best with consternation to dejectThe Spartan valour, or how best betray.With him the leaders climb the arduous hill,From whence the dreadful prospect they command,Where endless plains by white pavilions hidSpread, like the vast Atlantic, when no shore,No rock or promontory stops the sightUnbounded, as it wanders; but the moonResplendent eye of night in fullest orbThroughout th' interminated surface throwsIts rays abroad, and decks in snowy lightThe dancing billows; such was Xerxes' camp:A pow'r unrivall'd by the greatest king,Or conqueror, that e'er with ruthless hands
Dissolving all the sacred ties, which bindThe happiness of nations, have alarm'dThe sleeping fury Discord from her den.Not from the hundred brazen gates of Thebes,The tow'rs of Memphis, and the pregnant fieldsBy Nile's prolifick torrents delug'd o'er,E'er flow'd such armies with th' Aegyptian lordRenown'd Sesostris; who with trophies fill'dThe vanquish'd earth, and o'er the rapid foamOf distant Tanais, and the huge expanseOf trembling Ganges spread his dreaded name:Nor yet in Asia's far extended boundsE'er met such numbers, not when Belus drewTh' Assyrian bands to conquest, or the prideOf high-exalted Babylon survey'dThe plains along Euphrates cover'd wideWith armed myriads swarming from her walls;
When at the rage of dire SemiramisPeace fled affrighted from the ravag'd East.Yet all this hideous face of war dismaysNo Grecian heart. Unterrified they stood.Th' immeasurable camp with fearless eyesThey traverse, while in meditation nearThe treach'rous Malian waits, collecting allHis pomp of words to paint the hostile pow'r;Nor yet with falshood arms his fraudful tongueTo feign a tale of terrour: Truth herselfBeyond the reach of fiction to inhanceNow aids his treason, and with cold dismayMight pierce the boldest breast, unless secur'dBy dauntless virtue, which disdains to liveFrom liberty divorc'd. Requested nowBy ev'ry voice the traitor spake, and allAttentive ears incline. Oh! Greeks and friends!
Can I behold my native Malian fieldsPresenting hostile millions to your sight,And not with grief suppress the horrid tale,Which you exact from these ill-omen'd lips.On Thracia's sands I first beheld the foe,When, joining Europe with the Asian shore,A mighty bridge th' outragious waves restrain'd,And stem'd th' impetuous current; while in armsThe universal progeny of men▪Seem'd all before me trampling o'er the seaBy thousands and ten thousands: Persians, MedesAssyrians, Saces, Indians, swarthy filesFrom Aethiopia, Aegypt's tawny sons,Arabians, Bactrians, Parthians, all the strengthOf Libya and of Asia. Neptune groan'dBeneath the burthen, and indignant heav'dHis neck against th' incumbent weight. In vain
The violence of Boreas and the West,With rage combin'd, against th' unshaken pileDash'd half the Hellespont. The eastern worldSev'n days and nights uninterrupted pass,And pour on Thracia's confines. They acceptThe Persian lord, and range their hardy raceBeneath his standards. Macedonia's youthWith all Thessalia next, and ev'ry Greek,Who dwells beyond Thermopylae, attend.Thus not alone embodied Asia liftsHer threatning lance, but Macedon and Thrace,Whose martial loins with daring warriours teem,And faithless Greeks in multitudes untoldThe Persian Monarch aid. Celestial pow'rs!And thou, who reignest over men and Gods,Who in a moment by thy will supremeCanst quell the mighty in their proudest hopes,
And raise the weak to safety, thou impartThy instant succour; interpose thy arm;With lightning blast their legions: Oh! confoundWith triple-bolted thunder Persia's camp,Whence like an inundation with the mornShall millions rush, and overwhelm the Greeks.Resistance else were vain against an host,Which covers all Thessalia; for beyondThe Malian plains thus widely stretch'd below,Beyond the utmost measure of the sightBent from the height of this aspiring cliff,Lie yet more hideous numbers, which might drainThe streams of copious rivers with their thirst,And with their arrows hide the mid-day sun.THEN shall we join our battle in the shade,Dieneces replied. Not calmly thus
Diomedon. On Xerxes' camp he bendsHis low'ring brow, which frowns had furrow'd o'er,And thus exclaim'd. Bellona turn and viewWith joyful eyes that field, the fatal stage,Which regal madness hath for you prepar'dTo exercise your horrours. Thou, O Death,Shalt riot here unceasing, when the rocksOf yonder pass with bleeding ranks are strew'd;And all, who shun th' avenging steel of Greece,By pestilence and meager famine seiz'd,Shall with variety of ruin feastThy unabated hunger. Thus he spake,While on the host immense his gloomy eyesHe fix'd disdainful, and its strength defied.MEANTIME within th' entrenchment of the GreeksFrom Asia's monarch delegated came
Tigranes and Phraortes. From the hillsLeonidas conducts th' impatient chiefs.Around the hero in his tent they throng,When thus Tigranes their attention calls.AMBASSADORS from Persia's king we standBefore you Grecians. To display the pow'rOf our great master, were a needless task.The name of Xerxes, Asia's mighty lord,Invincible, and seated on a throneSurpassing human lustre, must have reach'dTh' extremest border of the earth, and taughtThe hearts of men to own resistless forceWith awe, and low submission. Yet I swearBy yon refulgent orb, which flames above,The glorious symbol of th' eternal pow'r,This military throng, this shew of war
Persuade me, you have never heard that name,At whose dread sound the billows wide remoteOf Indus tremble, and the Caspian wave,Th' Aegyptian tide, and Hellespontic surgeWith homage roll. O impotent and rash!Whom yet the large beneficence of heav'n,And our great monarch merciful and kindDeign to preserve. Resign your arms; disperseEach to your cities; there with humblest handsBefore your lord bestrew the way with flow'rs.AS through th' extensive grove, whose leafy boughsIntwining crown some eminence with shade,The tempests rush sonorous, and betweenThe crashing branches roar; by fierce disdainAnd indignation thus the Grecians mov'dWith clam'rous murmurs close the Persian's speech.
But Sparta's king arising, all is hush'dIn sudden silence; when he thus replied.O PERSIAN, when to Xerxes thou return'st,Say thou hast told the wonders of his pow'r;Then say, thou saw'st a slender band of Greece,Which dares his boasted millions to the field.THE Spartan said. Th'Ambassadors retire.Them o'er the limits of the Grecian linesDiomedon and Thespia's youth conduct.With slow solemnity they all proceedIn sullen silence. But their looks denoteWhat speech would shame and weaken. Wrath contractsThe forehead of Diomedon. His teethGnash with impatience for delay'd revenge.Disdain, which sprung from conscious merit, flush'd
The cheek of Dithyrambus. On the faceOf either Persian insolence and prideIncens'd by disappointment gloomy low'r'd.But when they reach'd the limits of the straits,Where Xerxes' camp began to open wideIts deep, immense arrangement; then the heartOf vain Tigranes, swelling at the sight,Thus overflows in loud and haughty phrase.O ARIMANIUS, origin of ill,Have we demanded of thy ruthless pow'r,Thus with the curse of madness to afflictThese wretched men? But since thy dreadful willTo irresistible perdition doomsThe sons of Greece, in vain should we oppose.Be thy dire will accomplish'd, let them fall,And fatten with their blood their native soil.ENRAG'D the stern Diomedon replies.Thou servile, base dependent on a king,Inglorious mercenary, slave to those,Whom most we scorn, thou boaster, dost thou know,That I beheld the Marathonian field;When, like the Libyan sands before the wind,Your host was scatter'd by th'unconquer'd Greeks;Where thou perhaps didst turn before this armTo ignominious flight thy shiv'ring limbs?O may I find thee in to morrow's fight!Then on this rocky pavement shalt thou lieBeneath this arm to feast the vulture's beak.HE ended here, and thus the Persian chief.O thou, whose hand omnipotent protectsThe throne of Xerxes, bend thy sacred ear!
For lo! my first victorious fruits of warTo thee I here devote, the gory spoils,Which from this Grecian with the rising dawnIn sight of either host my arm shall rend.PHRAORTES interrupting then began.I too would find among the Grecian chiefsOne, who in battle dare abide my spear.TO him thus answer'd Thespia's gallant youth.Thou look'st on me, O Persian. Worthier farThou mightst indeed have singled from our host,But none more willing to essay thy force.Yes, I will prove before the eye of Mars,How far the valour of the meanest GreekBeyond thy vaunts deserves the palm of fame.THIS said, the Persians to their king repair,Back to their camp the Grecians. There they foundEach soldier poizing his extended spear,And his large buckler bracing on his arm,For instant war prepar'd. Through all the filesEach leader moves exulting, and with praiseAnd exhortations aids their native warmth.Alone the Theban Anaxander pin'd,Who thus apart address'd his Malian friend.WHAT has thy lofty eloquence avail'd,Alas! in vain attempting to confoundThe Spartan valour? With redoubled firesSee how their bosoms glow. They wish to die,And wait impatient for th' unequal fight.
Too soon will come th' insuperable foes,And in promiscuous ruin all be whelm'd;Nor shall our merit to the Persian lordBe told, or known: for whose advent'rous feetTo serve the Thebans, through the guarded pass,The Grecian watch eluding, will approachThe tents of Asia, that the king may know,And spare his friends amid the gen'ral wreck;When his high-swoln resentment, like a floodIncreas'd with stormy show'rs, shall cover GreeceWith desolation? Epialtes here.WHENCE, Anaxander, this unjust despair?Is there a path on Oeta's hills unknownTo Epialtes? O'er the trackless rock,And mazy grove shall pass my secret steps.
This night I part. Thy merit shall be toldTo Persia's king. Thou only watch the hour,Nor then be tardy, when he wants thy aid.End of the Second Book.LEONIDAS. BOOK III.The argument.Tigranes and Phraortes repair to Xerxes, whom they find seated on a throne surrounded by his satraps in a magnificent pavilion; while the Magi stand before him, and sing an hymn containing the religion of Zoroastres. Xerxes, notwithstanding the arguments of his brothers Hyperanthes and Abrocomes, gives no credit to the ambassadors, who report, that the Grecians are determin'd to maintain the pass against him; but commands Demaratus an exil'd king of Sparta to attend him, and ascends his chariot to take a view of the Grecians himself. He passes through the midst of his army, consisting of many nations differing in arms, customs, and manners. He advances to the entrance of the straits, and surpris'd at the behaviour of the Spartans demands the reason of it from Demaratus; which occasions a conversation between them on the mercenary forces of Persia, and the militia of Greece. Demaratus weeping at the fight of his countrymen, is comforted by Hyperanthes. Xerxes still incredulous commands Tigranes and Phraortes to bring the Grecians bound before him the next day, and retires to his pavilion.NOW had Tigranes, and Phraortes gain'dThe splendid tent of Xerxes. Him they foundBegirt with princes, and illustrious chiefs,The potentates of Asia. Near his sideHis valiant brothers stood, Abrocomes,And Hyperanthes, then Pharnuchus brave,Pandates, Intaphernes, mighty lords,And numbers more in purple splendour clad,With homage all attending round the throne,Whose gorgeous seat erected high upboreTheir regal master. He above their headsLook'd down imperious. So the stately tow'rOf Belus, mingling its majestick frontWith heav'n's bright azure, from on high survey'dThe huge extent of Babylon, with allIts sumptuous domes and palaces beneath.
That day the monarch deem'd to enter Greece,And hide her fields with war; but first ordains,That grateful hymns should celebrate the nameOf Oromasdes: so the Persians call'dThe world's great author. By the king's decreeThe Magi stood before th' unfolded tent.Fire blaz'd beside them. Tow'rds the sacred flameThey turn'd, and sent their tuneful praise to heav'n.FROM Zoroastres was the song deriv'd,Who on the hills of Persia from his caveWith flow'rs incircled, and with murm'ring founts,That chear'd the solemn mansion, had reveal'd,How Oromasdes, radiant source of good,Original, immortal fram'd the globeWith all its varied beauty: how with starsBy him the heav'ns were spangled: how the sun,
Refulgent Mithra, purest spring of light,And genial warmth, whence fruitful Nature smiles,Burst from the east at his creating voice;When streight beyond the golden verge of dayNight shew'd the horrours of her distant reign,Whence black, and hateful Arimanius sprung,The author foul of evil: he with shadesFrom his dire mansion veil'd the earth and skies,Or to destruction chang'd the solar beam,When parching fields deny the foodful grain,And from their channels fly th' exhaling streams,Whence pestilence, and famine: how the pow'rOf Oromasdes in the human breastBenevolence, and equity infus'd,Truth, temperance, and wisdom sprung from heav'n;When Arimanius blacken'd all the soulWith falshood, and injustice, with desires
Insatiable, with violence, and rage,Malignity, and folly. If the handOf Oromasdes on precarious lifeShed wealth, and pleasure, soon th' infernal GodWith wild excess, or av'rice blasts the joy.Thou, Oromasdes, victory dost give.By thee with fame the regal head is crown'd.Great Xerxes owns thy succour. When with stormsThe hate of direful Arimanius swell'dThe Hellespont, thou o'er the angry surgeThe destin'd master of the world didst lead,This day his promis'd glories to enjoy,When Greece affrighted to his arm shall bend;Ev'n as at last shall Arimanius fallBefore thy might, and evil be no more.THE Magi ceas'd their harmony; when now
Before the king with adoration bow'dTigranes and Phraortes. Prone they lay,And o'er their foreheads spread their abject hands,As from a present deity too brightFor mortal vision to conceal their eyes.At length in humble phrase Tigranes thus.O XERXES, live for ever! Gracious lord!Who dost permit thy servants to approachThy awful sight, and prostrate thus to ownThy majesty and greatness. May the pow'rOf Oromasdes stretch thy scepter'd armO'er all the nations from the Indian shores,Ev'n to the waters of the western main,From northern Tanais to the source of Nile!And still from thee may Arimanius turnAgainst thy foes his malice to mankind!
By him, ev'n now with frenzy smote, the GreeksReject thy proffer'd clemency. The mornShall see them bleed the victims of thy wrath.HERE, to his brothers turning, Xerxes spake.Say, Hyperanthes? Does thy soul believeThese tydings? Sure these slaves have never dar'dTo face the Grecians, but delude our earWith base impostures, which their fears suggest.To him this answer Hyperanthes form'd.O from his servants may the king avertHis indignation! Greece was fam'd of oldFor martial virtue, and intrepid sons:I have essay'd their valour, and with meAbrocomes can witness. When our sireThe great Darius to th' Athenian shore
With Artaphernes, and with Datis sentOur tender youth; at Marathon we found,How vain the hopes, that numbers should dismayA foe resolv'd on victory, or death.Yet not as one contemptible, or baseLet me appear before thee: though the GreeksWith such unconquer'd spirits be indu'd,Soon as the king shall summon me to war,He shall behold me in the dang'rous vanExalt my spear, and pierce the hostile ranks,Or sink before them. Xerxes then return'd;WHY over Asia, and the Libyan soil,With all their nations does my potent armExtend its scepter? Wherefore do I sweepAcross the globe with millions in my train?Why shade the Ocean with unnumber'd sails?
Whence all this pow'r, unless th' eternal willHad doom'd to give one master to the world,And that the earth's extremity aloneShould bound my empire? He for this reduc'dRevolted Aegypt, and inlarg'd my swayWith sandy Libya, and the sultry climeOf Aethiopia. He for this subdu'dThe Hellespontic rage, and taught the seaObedience to my pow'r. Then cease to think,That heav'n deserting now the cause of kingsThose despicable Grecians will inspireWith courage more than human, and expungeThe common fears of nature from their breasts.He ceas'd, when thus Abrocomes began.THE king commands us to reveal our hearts:Then may the sun to lightning change his beams
And blast my head with ruin; may the kingLook on his servant with a loathing eye,If what I here affirm be false, or vain,That yonder Grecians will oppose our course.THE king arose. No more: prepare my Car;The Spartan exile Demaratus call:We will our selves advance and view the foe.THE monarch will'd; and suddenly he hearsHis trampling horses. High on silver wheelsThe iv'ry car with azure sapphirs shone,Caerulean beryls, and the jasper green,The emerald, the ruby's glowing blush,The flaming topaz with its golden beam,The pearl, th' impurpled amathyst, and allThe various gems, which India's mines affordTo deck the pomp of kings. In burnish'd gold
A sculptur'd eagle from behind displaysIts stately neck, and o'er the monarch's headExtends its dazzling wings. Eight gen'rous steeds,Which on the fam'd Nysaean plain were nurs'dIn wintry Media, drew the radiant car.Not those of old to Hercules refus'dBy false Laomedon, nor they, which boreThe son of Thetis through the scatter'd rearOf Troy's devoted race, might these surpassIn strength, or beauty. With obedient prideThey heard their lord: exulting in the airThey toss'd their foreheads, while the silver manesSmote on their glitt'ring necks. The king ascends:Beside his footstool Demaratus sat.The charioteer now shakes the golden reins,Bold Patiramphes. At the signal boundTh' attentive steeds; the chariot flew; behind
Ten thousand horse in thunder swept the field.The eastern bands (so Xerxes had ordain'd)Between the sea-beat margin, and the campAll wait imbattled, all prepar'd to passThermopylae. To these with rapid wheelsTh' imperial car proceeds. Th' approaching kingSoon through the wide battalions is proclaim'd.He now draws nigh. Th' innumerable hostRoll back by nations, and admit their lordWith all his satraps. From his crystal domeRais'd on the bottom of the watry worldThus when the potent ruler of the floodsWith each caerulean deity ascends,Thron'd on his pearly chariot; all the deepDivides its bosom to th' emerging God.So Xerxes rode between the Asian worldOn either side receding; when, as down
Th' immeasurable ranks his sight was lost,A momentary gloom o'ercast his mind,While this reflection fill'd his eyes with tears:That soon, as Time an hundred years had told,Not one of all those thousands should survive.Whence to obscure thy pride arose that cloud?Was it, that once humanity could touchA tyrant's breast? or rather did thy soulRepine, O Xerxes, at the bitter thought,That all thy pow'r was mortal? But the veilOf sadness soon forsook his brightning eyes,As with adoring homage millions bow'd,And to his heart relentless pride recall'd.Elate the mingled prospect he surveysOf glitt'ring files unnumber'd, chariots scyth'dOn thund'ring axles roll'd with haughty steedsIn sumptuous trappings clad (Barbaric pomp)
Which tore with spurning hoofs the sandy beach;While ev'ry banner to the sun expandsIts gorgeous folds, that beam'd with gold, with shields,Tiaras, helms environ'd, and with spearsIn number equal to the bladed grass,Whose living green in vernal beauty cloathsThessalia's vale. What pow'rs of sounding verseCan to the mind present th' amazing scene?Not thee, whom Rumour's fabling voice delights,Poetic Fancy, to my aid I call;But thou, historic Truth, support my song,Which shall the various multitude display,Their arms, their manners, and their native seats.THE Persians first in scaly corselets shoneWith colours varying on the gorgeous sleeves,A gen'rous nation. From their infant age
Their tongues were practic'd in the love of truth,Their limbs inur'd to ev'ry manly toil,To brace the bow, to rule th' impetuous steed,And dart the javelin; worthy to enjoyThe liberty, their injur'd fathers lost,Whose arms for Cyrus overturn'd the strengthOf Babylon and Sardis, and advanc'dThe victors head above his country's laws.Such were the Persians; but untaught to formThe ranks of battle, with unequal forceAgainst the phalanx of the Greeks they stood,And to the massy shield, and weighty spearA target light, and slender lance oppos'd.On ev'ry head tiaras rose, like tow'rs,Impenetrable. All with burnish'd goldBlaz'd their gay sandals, and the floating reinsOf each proud courser. Daggers from their thighs,
A well-stor'd quiver from their shoulders hung,And strongest bows of mighty size they bore.Next, with resembling arms the Medes are seen,The Cissians, and Hyrcanians. Media onceFrom her bleak mountains aw'd the subject East.Her kings in cold Ecbatana were thron'd.The Cissians march'd from Susa's regal walls,From sultry fields o'erspread with branching palms,And white with lillies, water'd by the tidesOf fam'd Choaspes, whose transparent wavesThe golden goblet wafts to Persia's kings.No other stream the royal lip bedews.Hyrcania's race forsook their fruitful climeDark with the verdure of expanding oaks,To Ceres dear and Bacchus. There the cornBent by its golden burthen sheds unreap'dIts plenteous seed impregnating the soil
With future harvests; while the bees resideAmong th' intwining branches of the groves,Where with their labours they enrich the leaves,Which flow with sweetness. Next, Assyria's sonsTheir brazen helms display, th'unskilful workOf rude Barbarians. Thick-wove flax defendsTheir chest and loins. A buckler guards their arm.Girt with a falchion each a mace sustainsO'erlaid with iron. On Euphrates' banksIn Babylon's stupendous walls they dwell,And o'er the plains, where once with mightier tow'rsOld Ninus rear'd its head, th' imperial seatOf eldest tyrants. These Chaldaea joins,The land of shepherds. On the pastures wideThere Belus first discern'd the various courseOf heav'n's bright planets, and the clust'ring starsWith names distinguish'd, whence himself was deem'd
The chief of Gods. His heav'n-ascending faneIn Babylon the proud Assyrians rais'd.Drawn from the fertile soil, which Ochus laves,The Bactrians stood, like Persia's bands attir'd,Though less their javelins, and their bows of cane;The Paricanians next all rough with hidesOf shaggy goats, with bows and daggers arm'd.Alike in horrid garb the Caspian trainFrom barren mountains, and the dreary coast,Which bounds the stormy lake, that bears their name,With cany bows, and scymetars were led.The Indians then a threefold band appear'd.Part guide the horse, and part the rapid car;The rest on foot within the bending caneFor slaughter held their iron-pointed reeds.These o'er the Indus from the distant floodsOf Ganges pass'd, and left a region lov'd
By lavish Nature. There the plenteous yearTwice crown'd with harvests smiles. The honey'd shrub,The cinnamon, and spikenard bless their fields.Array'd in native wealth the warriours shone.Their ears were grac'd with pendants, and their handsIncircled wore a bracelet starr'd with gems.These were the nations, who to Xerxes sentTheir mingled aids of infantry and horse.NOW, Muse, recount what numbers yet untoldOn foot obscur'd the surface of the shore;Or who in chariots, or on camels beatThe loosen'd sand. The Parthians first advance,Then weak in numbers o'er the Malian strandFar from their lonely vales, and woody hills,Not yet renown'd for warlike steeds, they trod.With them the Sogdians, Dadices arrang'd,
Gandarians, and Chorasmians, all attir'd,Like Bactria's sons. To these the Saces join,From cold Imaüs drawn, from Oxus' waves,And Cyra built on Iäxartes' brink,The bound of Persia's Empire. Wild, untam'd,And prone to rage, their desarts they forsook.A bow, a falchion, and a pond'rous axThe savage legions arm'd. A pointed caskO'er each grim visage rear'd its iron cone.In arms, like Persians, the Saranges stood.High as the knee their buskins stretch'd, and clungAround their ham. With glowing colours dy'dGay shone their varied garments. Next are seenThe Pactyan, Mycian, and the Utian trainIn skins of goats, all horrid. Bows they wieldOf springy reed, with poynards at their sides.With spotted hides of leopards all array'd,
Or with the spoil from tawny lions torn,In graceful range the Aethiopians standOf equal stature, and a beauteous frame;Though scorching Phoebus had imbrown'd their face,And curl'd their crisped locks. In ancient songRenown'd for justice, riches they disdain'd,As foes to virtue. From their seat remoteOn Nilus' verge above th' Aegyptian bound,Forc'd by their kings' malignity and prideThese friends of hospitality and peace,Themselves uninjur'd, wag'd reluctant warAgainst a land, whose climate, and whose nameTo them were strange. With hardest stone they pointThe rapid arrow. Bows of hideous length,Form'd with th'elastic branches of the palm,They bore, and lances arm'd with horns of goats,And maces strong with iron. Now, O Muse,
Recite the nations, who in helmets fram'dOf various parts, and close-connected joints,With darts, and poynards, shields, and lances weak,A feeble train, attend their tyrant's will,All victims destin'd to imbrue with goreThe Grecian spears; the Paphlagonians firstFrom where Carambis with projected browsO'erlooks the dusky Euxine wrapt in mists,And where through flow'rs, that paint its various banks,Parthenius flows; the Mariandynians next,The Matienian, and the Ligyan bands,With them the Syrian multitudes, who dwellNear Daphne's grove, who cultivate the glebeWide-water'd by Orontes, who alongTh' extended ridge of Libanus are nurs'dAmong the cedars, or with foodful datesPluckt from the palms, whose fruitage grac'd the plains
Around Damascus: all, who bear the nameOf Cappadocians, swell the Syrian host,With those who gather from the fragrant shrubThe aromatic balsam, and extractIts milky juice along the lovely sideOf winding Jordan, till immers'd it sleepBeneath the pitchy surface, which obscuresTh' Asphaltic lake. The Phrygians then advance.To them their ancient colony is join'd,Th' Armenian bands. These see the bursting springsOf strong Euphrates cleave the yielding earth,And wide in lakes expanding hide the plain.Thence with collected waters fierce and deepIts passage rending through diminish'd rocksTo Babylon it foams. Not so the waveOf soft Araxes to the Caspian glides.But stealing imperceptibly it laves
The fruitful herbage of Armenia's meads.Next, strange to view, in similar attire,Though far unlike in manners to the Greeks,Appear the Lydians. Wantonness and sportWere all their care. Beside Caÿster's stream,Or smooth Maeander winding silent by,Or near Pactolus' wave among the vinesOf Tmolus rising, or the wealthy tideOf golden-sanded Hermus they allureThe sight enchanted with the graceful dance,Or with melodious sweetness charm the air,And melt to softest languishment the soul.What to the battle's danger could inciteThese tender sons of luxury? The lashOf their stern monarch urg'd their shiv'ring limbsThrough all the tempests, which enrag'd the main,And shook beneath their trembling steps the pile,
That join'd the Asian and the western worlds.To these Maeonia hot with sulph'rous minesUnites her troops. No tree adorns their fieldsUnbless'd with verdure, and with ashes strewn.Black are the rocks, and ev'ry hill deform'dWith conflagration. Helmets press'd their brows.Two darts they brandish'd. Round their woolly vestA sword was girt, and hairy hides compos'dTheir bucklers round and light. The Mysians leftOlympus wood-envelop'd, and the soilWash'd by Caïcus, and the baneful tideOf Lycus, nurse of serpents. Targets, helms,And wooden javelins harden'd in the flamesThey bore. By these, imbattled next are seenAn ancient nation, who in early times,By Trojan arms assail'd, their native landEsteem'd less dear than freedom, and exchang'd
Their seat on Strymon, where in Thrace it poursIts freezing current, for the distant shoresOf fishy Sangar. These Bithynians nam'dTheir habitations to the sacred feetOf Dindymus extend. Yet there they groan'dBeneath oppression, and their freedom mourn'dOn Sangar now, as once on Strymon lost.The ruddy skins of foxes form'd their cask;Their shields were fashion'd like the horned moon;A dart, and slender poynard arm'd their hands;A vest embrac'd their bodies, while abroadTing'd with unnumber'd hues a mantle flow'd.But other Thracians, who their former nameRetain'd in Asia, stood with shining helms.The horns of bulls in imitating brassAdorn'd the lofty crest. Phoenician clothTheir legs infolds, with brightest purple stain'd;
And through the forest wont to chase the boar,A hunter's spear they grasp. What nations stillOn either side of Xerxes, while he pass'd,Present their huge array, and swell his soulWith more than mortal pride? The num'rous trainOf Moschians and Macronians now succeed,And Mosynoecians, who, with berries fed,In wooden tow'rs along the Pontic shoreRepose their painted limbs; the mirthful raceOf Tibarenians next, whose wanton mindsDelight in sport, and laughter: all in casksOf wood, with shields, and lances small, whose pointsBeyond proportion lengthen. Then approach,In garments o'er their spacious bosom clasp'd,And part with javelins, part with Lycian bows,A people destin'd in eternal verse,Ev'n thine, sublime Maeonides, to live.
These are the Milyans, Solymi their nameIn thy celestial strains, Pifidia's hillsTheir dwelling. Once a formidable train,They fac'd the great Bellerophon in war,Now doom'd a more tremendous foe to meet,Themselves unnerv'd with bondage, and to leaveTheir putrid bodies for the dogs of Greece.Next are the Marian legions furnish'd allWith shields of skins, with darts, and helmets woveOf strongest texture. Aria's host protendThe Bactrian lance, and brace the Persian bow,Drawn from a region horrid all with thorn,One hideous waste of sands, which mock the toilOf patient culture; save one favour'd spot,Which, like an isle, emerges from the wild,In verdure clad, and interspers'd with vines,Whose gen'rous clusters yield a juice, that scorns
The injuries of Time. Yet Nature's handHad sown their rocks with coral, and enrich'dTheir desert hills with veins of sapphirs blue,And those, whose azure sparks of gold adorn.These from the turbant flame. On ev'ry neckThe coral blushes through the num'rous throng.The Allarodians, and Sasperian bandsWere arm'd with poniards, like the Cholchian host;Their heads were guarded with a helm of wood.Short were their spears, of hides undress'd their shields.The Cholchians march'd from Phasis, and the shores,Where once Medea fair enchantress stood,And wondring view'd the first advent'rous bark,That stem'd the Pontic foam. From Argo's sideThe demigods descended, and repair'dTo her fell sire's inhospitable walls.His blooming graces Jason there display'd.
With ev'ry art of eloquence divineHe claim'd the golden fleece. The virgin heard,She gaz'd with fatal ravishment, and lov'd.Then to the hero she resigns her heart;Her magic tames the brazen-footed bulls;She lulls the sleepless dragon, and to GreeceWith faithless Jason wafts the radiant prize.The Cholchians then pursu'd their steps with war,And now with antient enmity inflam'd,Or else compell'd by Xerxes to recalThe long-forgotten wrong, they menace GreeceWith desolation. Next in Persian guiseA croud advanc'd, who left the various islesIn Persia's gulph, and round Arabia known.Some in their native topaz were adorn'd,From Ophiodes, and Topazos sprung;And some with shells of tortoises, which brood
Around Casitis' verge. To them were join'dThose, who reside, where Erythras intomb'dLies all beset with palms, a pow'rful king,Who nam'd of old the Erythraean main.The Lybians next are plac'd. In chariots scyth'dThey sat terrific, cloath'd in skins, with dartsOf wood well-temper'd in the hardning flames.Not Libya's deserts from tyrannic swayCould hide her sons; much less could freedom dwellAmid the plenty of Arabia's fields:Where spicy cassia, and the fragrant reed,And myrrh, and hallow'd frankincense perfumeThe zephir's wing. A bow of largest sizeTh' Arabians wield, and o'er their lucid vestLoose floats a mantle on their shoulder clasp'd.Of these two myriads on the lofty backOf camels rode, that match'd the swiftest horse.SUCH were the numbers, which from Asia ledBow'd down with low prostration to the wheelsOf Xerxes' chariot. Yet what legions moreExpand their mighty range? What banners stillThe Malian sands o'ershadow? Forward rollsThe regal car through nations, which in arms,And order'd ranks unlike the eastern throngUpheld the spear and buckler. Yet untaughtTo bend the servile knee erect they stood;Unless that mourning o'er the shameful weightOf their new bondage some their brows depress'd,And stain'd their arms with sorrow. Europe's raceWere these, whom Xerxes by resistless forceHad gather'd to his standards. Murm'ring hereThe sons of Thrace, and Macedonia stood,Here on his steed the brave Thessalian frown'd.
There pin'd reluctant multitudes, who boreThe name of Greeks, and peopled all the coastBetween Byzantium, and the Malian bay.THROUGH all the numbers, which ador'd his pride,Or fear'd his pow'r, the monarch now was pass'd;Nor yet among those myriads could be foundOne, who with Xerxes' self in tow'ring size,Or beauteous features might compare. O wretch!Possess'd of all, but virtue; doom'd to shew,How mean without her is unbounded pow'r,The charm of beauty, and the blaze of state,How insecure of happiness, how vain.Thou, who couldst mourn the common lot, which heav'nFrom none withholds; which oft to thousands provesTheir only refuge from a tyrant's rage;And which by pining sickness, age, or pain
Becomes at last a soothing hope to all;Thou, who couldst weep, that Nature's gentle handShould lay her wearied offspring in the tomb,Yet couldst remorseless from their peaceful seatsLead half the nations in a clime unknownTo fall the victims of thy ruthless pride;What didst thou merit from the injur'd world?What suff'rings to compensate for the tearsOf Asia's mothers, for unpeopled realms,And all this waste of nature? On his hostThe king exulting bends his haughty sight,When thus to Demaratus he began.NOW Demaratus to thy soul recalMy father great Darius, who receiv'dThy wandring steps expell'd their native home.Ill would it then become thee to beguile
Thy benefactors, and the truth disguise,Look back on all those thousands, and declare,If yonder Grecians will oppose their march.THE exile answer'd. Deem not mighty lord,I will deceive thy goodness by a taleForg'd for their glory, whose deluded mindsPerversely hearken'd to the sland'rer's tongue;Who forc'd me with unmerited disgraceTo tread the paths of banishment and woe.Nor be the king offended, while I speakThe words of truth. The Spartans never fly.HERE with contemptuous smiles the king return'd.Wilt thou, who once wert Lacedaemon's chief,Encounter twenty Persians? Yet those GreeksWith greater disproportion must confrontOur host to-morrow. Demaratus thus.BY single combat were the tryal vain,And vainer still by my unworthy sword,To prove the merit of united force,Which oft by military skill surmountsThe strength of numbers. Nor in fields of warThe Greeks excel by discipline alone,But from their manners. Grant thy ear, O king,The diff'rence learn of Grecian bands, and thine.The flow'r, the bulwark of thy pow'rful hostAre mercenaries. These are canton'd roundThy provinces. No fertile field demandsTheir painful hand to turn the fallow glebe.Them to the noon-day toil no harvest calls.The stubborn oak along the mountains browSinks not beneath their stroke. With careful eyesThey mark not how the flocks, or heifers feed.
To them of wealth, and all possessions voidThe name of country with an empty soundFlies o'er the ear, nor warms their joyless hearts,Who share no country. Needy, yet with scornRejecting labour, wretched by their wants,Yet profligate through indolence, with limbsSoft and enervate, and with minds corrupt;From misery, debauchery, and slothAre these to battle drawn against a foeInur'd to hardship, and the child of toil,Wont through the freezing show'r, and wintry stormO'er his own glebe the tardy ox to goad;Or in the sun's impetuous heat to glowBeneath the burthen of the yellow sheaves:Whence on himself, on her, whose faithful armsInfold him joyful, and a num'rous race,
Which glads his dwelling, plenty he bestowsWith independence; and when call'd to warFor these his dearest comfort, and his care,And for the harvest promis'd to his toil,He lifts the shield, nor shuns unequal force.Such are the pow'rs of ev'ry state in GreeceOne only breeds a race more warlike still,Ev'n those, who now defend that rocky pass,The sons of Lacedaemon. They untaughtTo break the glebe, or bind the golden sheaves,To far severer labours are inur'd.Alone for war, their sole delight, and care.From infancy to manhood, are they form'dTo want, and danger, to th' unwholesome ground,To winter watches, and inclement skies,To plunge through torrents, brave the tusky boar,To arms, and wounds; an exercise of pain
So fierce and constant, that to them a campWith all its hardships is the seat of rest,And war itself remission from their toils.THY words are folly, scornful here repliedThe Persian monarch. Does not freedom dwellAmong the Grecians? Therefore will they shunSuperiour foes, for whosoe'er is freeWill fly from danger; while the Persians know,If from th' allotted station they retreat,The scourge awaits them, and my heavy wrath.CONCEIVE not, Xerxes, Sparta's chief return'd,The Grecians want an object, where to fixTheir eyes with rev'rence, and obedient dread.To them more aweful than the name of kingTo Asia's trembling millions is the law,
Whose sacred voice injoins them to confrontUnnumber'd foes, to vanquish, or to die.IN silence now the banish'd king remain'd.While near the straits the chariot roll'd; it chanc'd,The Spartans then were station'd out on guard.These in gymnastic exercise employ'd,Nor heed the monarch, nor his gaudy train;But toss'd the spear, and whirl'd the rapid dart,Or met with adverse shields in single war,Or trooping swiftly rush'd on ev'ry sideWith ranks unbroken, and with equal feet:While others calm beneath their polish'd helmsDrew down their hair, which hung in sable curls,And spread their necks with terrour. Xerxes hereThe exile questions. What do these intend,Who thus with careful hands adjust their hair?TO whom the Spartan. O imperial lord,Such is their custom, to adorn their heads,When with determin'd valour they presentTheir dauntless breasts before the jaws of death.Bring down thy myriads all in glitt'ring steel,Arm, if thou canst, the gen'ral race of man;All, who possess the regions unexplor'dBeyond the Ganges, all, whose wand'ring stepsBehind the Caspian range the Scythian wild,With those, who drink the secret fount of Nile,Yet to the breasts of Sparta's sons shall fearBe still a stranger. Thus with fervour spakeThe exil'd king, when gushing from his eyesResistless grief o'erflow'd his cheek. AsideHis head he turn'd, and wept in copious streams.The sad remembrance of his former state,
His dignity, his greatness, and the sightOf those brave ranks, which thus unshaken stood,And spread amazement through the world in arms,Excite those sorrows. Oft with eager eyesHe views the godlike warriours, who beneathHis standard once victorious fought, who call'dHim once their king and leader. Then againHis head he bows with anguish, and bedewsHis breast with tears; in agony bemoansHis faded honours, his illustrious nameForgotten now, his majesty defil'dWith exile and dependence. So obscur'dBy creeping ivy, and by sordid mossSome lordly palace, or stupendous fane,Magnificent in ruin stands; where timeWide-wasting from the nodding roof hath mow'dThe column down, and cleft the pond'rous dome.NOT unobserv'd by Hyperanthes mourn'dTh' unhappy Spartan. Kindly to his ownTh' exile's hand he joins, and thus humane.O Demaratus, this thy grief confirms,How well the Greeks deserve thy gen'rous praise,Who still repining dost their loss deplore,Though cherish'd here with universal love.But O let indignation in thy breastRevive thy wrongs! then bless th' auspicious fate,Which led thee far from calumny and fraudTo share the favour of the highest king.AS Demaratus with a grateful mindAddress'd himself to answer, Persia's kingThus interrupted. Soon, as morning shines,
Do thou Tigranes and Phraortes headThe Medes and Saces. Bring those Grecians bound.This said. The monarch to his tent return'd.End of the Third Book.LEONIDAS. BOOK IV.The argument.Leonidas rising by break of day commands a body of Arcadians, with the Thespians, and Plataeans to be drawn out for battle in that part of Thermopylae, which lay under the Phocian wall, from whence he harangues them. The enemy approaches. Diomedon kills Tigranes in single combat. Both armies join battle. Dithyrambus kills Phraortes. The Persians, entirely defeated, are pursued with great slaughter by Diomedon and Dithyrambus to the extremity of the pass. The Grecian commanders, after the pursuit retire for refreshment to a cave in the side of mount Oeta. Leonidas recals them to the camp, and sends down fresh forces. Diomedon, and Dithyrambus, with the Plataeans are permitted to continue in the field. By the advice of Diomedon the Grecians advance to the broadest part of Thermopylae, where they form a line of thirty in depth, consisting of the Plataeans, Mantinéans, Tegaeans, Thebans, Corinthians, Phliasians, and Mycenaeans. The attack is renew'd with great violence by Hyperanthes, Abrocomes, and the principal Persian leaders at the head of some chosen troops.LACONIA's leader with the morning rose,When thus to Alpheus. From Arcadia's bandsSelect a thousand spears. To these uniteThe Thespians and Plataeans. Range their linesBefore the wall, which fortifies the pass:There close-imbodied will their might repulseThe num'rous foe. Obedient to his willTh' appointed legions issuing from their tentsWith deep'ning ranks Leonidas inclose.So round their monarch in his stormy caveThe winds assemble, from his sable throneWhen Aeolus sends forth his dread commandTo swell the main, or heav'n with clouds deform,Or bend the forest from the mountain's brow.The chief of Sparta from the rampart's heightThus to the fight the list'ning host inflames.THIS day, O Grecians, countrymen, and friends,Your wives, your offspring, your paternal seats,Your fathers, country, liberty, and lawsHave sent you hither, from your infant ageVers'd in the various discipline of Mars,Laborious, active, virtuous, brave, and free,To match your valour with ignoble foesIn war unskilful, nature's basest dross,The foes of all utility and worth,And thence a monarch's mercenary slaves;With spirits broke by servitude and want,With limbs relax'd by sloth, and wanton ease,With minds debauch'd by vices, uninspir'dBy all th'indearing cares in free-born hearts,Who cold and drooping fight without a cause,To whom defeat is neither grief, nor shame,
Who seek no fruit from victory, but spoil.These are the flow'r of Asia's host. The rest,Who fill their boasted numbers, are a croudForc'd from their dwellings to the bloody field,From whom till now with jealous care their lordHas still withheld the instruments of war.These are the people taught with patient griefTo bear the rapine, cruelty, and spurnsOf Xerxes' mercenary bands, and pineIn servitude to slaves. With terrour soundsThe trumpet's clangor in their trembling ears.Unwonted loads, the buckler and the lanceTheir hands sustain incumber'd, and presentThe mockery of war.—But ev'ry eyeFlames with impatient ardour, and your breastsToo long their swelling spirit have confin'd.Go then, ye sons of Liberty, and sweep
These bondmen from the field. Resistless rendThe glitt'ring standard from their servile hands.Hurl to the ground their ignominious headsThe warriour's helm profaning. Think the shadesOf your forefathers rear their sacred browsHere to enjoy the glory of their sons.HE spake. Loud Paeans burst from all the host.With fierce reply unnumber'd shouts ascendFrom hostile nations thronging down the pass.Such is the roar of Aetna, when her mouthDisplodes combustion from her sulph'rous depths,And blasts the smiles of Nature. Dauntless stoodIn deep array before the Phocian wallThe Greeks close-wedg'd with implicated shields,And spears protended, like the graceful rangeOf arduous elms, whose interwoven boughs
Before some rural palace wide expandTheir venerable umbrage to retardThe North's impetuous wing. As o'er the mainIn lucid rows the rising waves reflectThe sun's effulgence, so the Grecian helmsReturn'd his light, which o'er their convex pour'd,And scatter'd splendour on the dancing plumes.Down rush'd the foe. Exulting in the vanTheir haughty leader shakes his threatning lance,And frowns defiance. Bursting from his rankDiomedon with instant fury fac'dTh' impending foes. Meantime he loudly callsTheir chief Tigranes, whom he thus defies.NOW thou art met, Barbarian. Wouldst thou proveThy actions equal to thy vaunts, commandThy troops to halt, while thou and I engage.TIGRANES turning to the Persians spake.My friends, and soldiers, check your ardent haste,While my strong lance yon Grecian's pride confounds.HE ceas'd. In dreadful opposition nowEach combatant advanc'd. With sinewy handThey gripe their spears high-brandish'd. Thrice they droveWith well-directed force the pointed steelAt either's throat, and thrice their shields repelThe destin'd wound. At length the Eastern chiefWith all his pow'rs collected for the strokeHis javelin rivets in the Grecian targe.Aside Diomedon inclines, and shunsApproaching fate. Then all his martial skillUndaunted summons. His forsaken lanceBeside him cast, his falchion he unsheaths.The blade descending on Tigranes' arm,
That instant struggling to redeem his spear,The shiv'ring hand dissevers. Pale affrightUnmans the Persian, while his active foeFull on his neck discharg'd the rapid sword,And open'd wide the purple gates of life.Low sinks Tigranes in eternal shade.The conqueror bestrides the prostrate dead,Then in the clotted ringlets of the hairHis hand intwining from the bleeding trunkThe head disjoin'd, and whirl'd with sudden rageAmid the hostile numbers. All with dreadRecoil, where'er the ghastly visage flewIn sanguine circles, and pursu'd its trackOf horrour through the air. Not less amaz'dA barb'rous nation, whom the chearful dawnOf science ne'er illumin'd, view on highA meteor waving with portentous blaze;
Where oft, as superstition vainly dreams,Some daemon sits amid the baneful fires,Dispersing plagues and desolation round.A while the stern Diomedon remainsTriumphant o'er the dire dismay, which frozeThe hearts of Persia, then with haughty port,And sullen joy among his gladsome friendsResumes his station. Still the Asian bandsWith consternation motionless beholdTheir foes with terrour, and suspend the fight;When thus Phraortes animates their breasts.HEAV'NS! can one leader's death appal this host,Which counts a train of monarchs for its chiefs!Behold Phraortes! from Imaüs' ridgeI draw my subject files. With hardy toilI through the pathless forest have explor'd
The tiger's cavern. This unconquer'd armHath from the lion rent the shaggy spoil.So through this field of slaughter will I chaseYon vaunting Greek with ruin on his headFor great Tigranes slain. His words reviveThe flame of valour through the drooping van,Then on the rear he brandishes his lance.Before him shrink th' affrighted croud, and rollTheir numbers headlong on the Grecian steelWith loose arrangement, and uncertain feet.Thus with his trident Ocean's angry GodFrom its vast bottom turns the hideous massOf waters upward, and o'erwhelms the beach.Terrific stood the fierce Plataean chiefAmid the Grecian van. His ample targe,Like a strong bulwark, prominent he rais'dBefore the line. There thunder'd all the storm
Of darts and arrows. His undaunted trainWith emulating ardour charge the foe.Where'er they turn the formidable spears,Which drench'd the glebe of Marathon with gore,The Persians heap the plain. DiomedonLeads on the slaughter. From his nodding crestThe sable plumes shook terrour. Asia's bandsAll shudder backward at the dreadful beamsOf that unconquerable sword, which fallsWith lightning's swiftness o'er their trembling heads,And reeking still with slain Tigranes' bloodTheir shatter'd ranks o'erturns. The furious chiefIncompass'd round with carnage, and besmear'dWith sanguine drops, inflames his warlike friends.O DITHYRAMBUS! let thy deeds this daySurmount their wonted lustre! Thou in arms,
Demophilus, worn grey, thy youth recal!Behold these slaves without resistance bleed.Advance, my ancient friend. Propitious FameSmiles on thy years, and gives thy aged handTo pluck fresh laurels for thy honour'd brow.AS, when indu'd with Promethéan heat,The molten clay respir'd; with sudden warmthSo glows the venerable Thespian's age,With new-born vigour ev'ry sinew swells.His falchion thund'ring on Cherasmes' helmThe forehead clove. Ecbatana to warSent forth Cherasmes. From her potent gatesHe proud in hope her swarming numbers led,With Ariazus and Pencestes join'd,His martial brothers. They attend his doomBy Dithyrambus foil'd. Their hoary sire
Shall o'er his solitary palace roam,Lamenting loud his childless years, and curseAmbition's fury, and the lust of war,Then pining bow with anguish to the grave.Next by the fierce Plataean's matchless swordExpires Damates, once the host and friendOf fall'n Tigranes; him that day he join'd,And left his native bands. Of Syrian birthIn Daphne he resided near the grove,Whose hospitable laurels in their shadeConceal'd the virgin fugitive, that scorn'dTh' embrace of Phoebus; hither she repair'dFar from her parent stream, in fables feign'dHerself a laurel to have rear'd her headWith verdant bloom in this retreat, the groveOf Daphne call'd, the seat of rural bliss,Fan'd by the wing of zephirs, and with rills
Of bubbling founts irriguous, Syria's boast,And happy rival of Thessalia's vale;Now hid for ever from Damates' eyes.Nor with unactive spears th' Arcadians stood.Gigantic Clonius unresisted press'dThe yielding Persians, who before him sunk,Crush'd like vile stubble underneath the stepsOf some glad hind, who visits o'er the plainHis new-shorn harvest. With a fearless eyePhraortes saw the gen'ral rout. He sprungO'er hills of carnage to confront the Greeks,Reproaching thus his own inglorious friends.FLY then ye cowards, and desert your chief;Yet single here my falchion shall opposeThe might of thousands. Raging thus, he droveThe deathful steel through Aristander's breast.
Him Dithyrambus lov'd, a sacred bardRever'd for justice, for his verse renown'd,Which sung the deeds of heroes, those, who fell,Or those, who conquer'd in their country's cause,Th' inraptur'd soul inspiring with the thirstOf glory won by virtue. His high strainThe Muses favour'd from their neighb'ring groves,And bless'd with heav'nly melody his lyre.No more from Thespia shall his feet ascendThe shady steep of Helicon. No moreThe streams divine of Aganippe's fountHis tuneful lip shall moisten, nor his handsPresent their off'rings in the Muses bow'r,The prostrate shield and unforsaken lanceNow feebly grasping, never more to swellHis lofty numbers on the sounding string.Lo! Dithyrambus weeps. Amid the rage
Of war and conquest a swift-gushing tearFinds one sad moment's interval to fallOn his pale friend. But soon the victor provesHis fierce revenge. Through shield and corselet plung'd,His furious javelin tore the Persian's chest.Phraortes sinks, nor yet expiring, seesWith indignation Persia's myriads fly.Swift through their broken legions, side by side,Urg'd by the voice of Victory and Fame,Diomedon and Dithyrambus rang'd.So, where Alphéus heard the rattling car,And sounding hoofs along his echoing banks,Two gen'rous coursers link'd in mutual reinsWith equal speed and ardour beat the dustTo reach the glories of th' Olympic goal.THIS from his lofty chariot Xerxes saw.He saw his numbers pouring from the straitsIn crouded flight, then spreading o'er the field,All broke and scatter'd; as a river burstsImpetuous from its fountain, then expandsIts limpid surface o'er the pastures broad.Thrice started from his seat th' astonish'd king,Shame, fear, and indignation rend his breast;As ruin irresistible were nearTo overwhelm his millions. Haste (he callsTo Hyperanthes) haste and meet the Greeks;Their daring rage and insolence repel,And from dishonour vindicate our name.THE godlike Hyperanthes through the tentsObedient moves. Deliberate and brave
Each active prince he summons, and with careCollects the hardiest troops. Around him soonInnumerable javelins flame. His voiceDemands attention, when he thus began.NOW friends divide, and form two equal bands.One with the great Abrocomes, with me,With Intaphernes, and Hydarnes bold,With Mindus and Pandates shall advance,And snatch this short-liv'd victory from Greece.You Abradates with Pharnuchus join'd,Orontes, and Mazaeus, keep the restImbattel'd ready to impart their aid,Shou'd envious Fate exhaust our num'rous ranks;For, O great Mithra, may thy radiant eyeNe'er see us, yielding to ignoble flight,The Persian fame dishonour, and the praise
Of our renown'd progenitors, who ledBy Cyrus gave a monarch to the world.Think, O ye princes, flow'r of Asia's realms,What endless infamy will blast your names,Should Greece, that narrow portion of the globe,Your arms defy; when Babylon hath low'r'dIts tow'ring head, when Lydia's pride is quell'd,And from Ecbatana its empire torn.Think too, ye warlike bands, our army's boast,What deeds are ask'd from your superiour swords;You, who our monarch's largest bounty share,You, to whose faith and valour he commitsHimself, his queens, his realms, and now his fame.WHILE Hyperanthes marshall'd thus his host,Far as th' extremest limit of the pass,Diomedon and Dithyrambus hung
Upon the rear of Persia. Now they turnVictorious, striding o'er th' impurpled heapsOf arms, and mangled dead, themselves with goreDistain'd; like two grim tigers, who have forc'dA nightly mansion on the desart rais'dBy some lone-wandring traveller, and dy'dWith human slaughter through the forest deepBack to their covert's dreary gloom retire.So pass'd these heroes o'er the crimson rock,Approaching now, where gasping on his shieldPhraortes lay recumbent. Thespia's youthAdvancing, thus his gen'rous soul express'd.LIV'ST thou, brave Persian? By propitious Jove,From whom the pleasing sense of mercy flowsThrough mortal bosoms, less my soul rejoic'd,
When Fortune gave the victory beforeThan now to raise thee from this field of death.THE dying prince his languid sight unclos'd,And thus with trembling lips. Vain man, forbearTo proffer me, what soon thyself must crave.The day is now extinguish'd in these orbs,Nor shall my heart beat longer than to scornThy mercy, Grecian; then resign to fate.HE ceas'd. The great, and haughty spirit fled.Demophilus drew nigh. The hoary chiefLong o'er Phraortes' corse his head inclin'd,Poiz'd on his lance, and thus address'd the slain.ALAS! how glorious were that bleeding breast,Had Justice giv'n the buckler to thy arm,
And to preserve a people bade thee die!Who now shall mourn thee! Thy ungrateful kingWill soon forget thy worth. For thee no tearsAmong thy native countrymen shall tellThe public sorrow; what to them avail'dThy might and dauntless spirit? Not to guardTheir wives and offspring from the spoil of war,Not from their walls repel the hostile blaze,Nor desolation from their fruitful fields,But to extend oppression didst thou fall;Perhaps with inborn virtues in thy heart,Which, but thy angry destiny forbade,By freedom cherish'd might have bless'd mankind.All-bounteous Nature! thy impartial lawsTo no selected race of men confineThe sense of glory, fortitude, and allThe nobler passions, which inspire the mind,
And render life illustrious. These thou plant'stIn ev'ry soil. But freedom, like the sun,Must warm the gen'rous seeds. By her aloneThey bloom and flourish; while oppression blastsThe tender virtues: hence a spurious growth,False honour, savage valour taint the soul,And wild ambition: hence rapacious pow'rThe ravag'd earth unpeoples, and the brave,A feast for dogs, bestrew th' insanguin'd plain,HE said. Around the venerable manThe Grecians throng'd attentive. Conquest hush'dIts joyful transports. O'er the horrid field,Late the rude scene of tumult, all was calm.So, when the song of Thracian Orpheus drewTo Hebrus' margin from their dreary seatsThe savage race, which Haemus wrapt in clouds,
Pangaeus cold, and Rhodopeian snowsIn blood and discord nurs'd; the soothing strainFlow'd with enchantment through their ravish'd ears:Their fierceness melted, and amaz'd they learn'dThe sacred laws of justice, which the bardMix'd with the musick of his heav'nly string.NOT from the field of slaughter far remoteIn Oeta's rugged side had Nature cloveA rocky cavern. This with moss she spread,And o'er the entrance downward from the rootsShe hung the shaggy trunks of branching firrsTo heav'n's hot ray impervious. From the sidesThe vivid laurel spread before the sunIts broad and glitt'ring foliage; and, above,The hill was darken'd with a solemn shadeCast from the sable cypress. This retreat
Cool, as the grot of Thetis, hid beneathThe vaulted ocean, with the murm'ring soundOf waters trickling from the riven stoneThe Grecian leaders to its gloom invites.Their helms they loosen, from their glowing cheeks.Against the rock their bucklers they repose.Propt on their spears they stood, when Agis thus,Sent by Leonidas, accosts the chiefs.O EVER-WORTHY of undying names!Leonidas recals you from your toil,Which has already fill'd our mouths with praise,Our eyes with wonder, that from yonder tow'rOn your unequall'd deeds incessant gaz'd.TO whom the bold Diomedon return'd.Go Agis, say to Lacedaemon's king,
As yet untir'd my hand can poize the spear,Nor hangs the buckler heavy on my arm.And shall I then retire? And once againShall not the sun, before he sink, beholdThe slaves of Xerxes tremble at my lance.TO him the Thespian youth. My friend and guideTo noble actions, since thy gen'rous mindIntent on fame disdains to rest, O grant,I too thy glorious labours may partake,And learn once more to imitate thy deeds.Thou, gentlest Agis, Sparta's chief intreatNot to command us from the field of war.THEN interpos'd Demophilus. O friend,And thou, lov'd offspring of the dearest man,Who dost restore my brother to my eyes,My soul your magnanimity applauds.
But, O reflect, that unabating toilSubdues the mightiest. Valour then will sigh,When the weak hand obeys the heart no more.Yet I declining with the weight of yearsWill not assign a measure to your strength;If still you find your vigour undecay'd,Stay and augment your glory. So, when timeYour heads shall whiten, and your feeble armsRound the high temple's peaceful vault have hungTheir consecrated shields, your native landShall then with honours doubled on your ageRequite the gen'rous labours of your prime.So spake the Senior, and forsook the cave.NOW from the bubbling spring DiomedonReceives the waters in his concave helm;And thus address'd the genius of the flood.WHOE'ER thou art, whose deity presidesO'er this fair fountain, bounteous are thy streams;Though ill shall I repay thee: for againWill I this day pollute thy silver wave,Which mix'd with gore shall tinge the Malian surge.SO saying from his brimming cask he quaff'dThe clear, refreshing moisture. Thus repairsThe spotted panther to Hydaspes' side,Or eastern Indus, feasted with the bloodOf some torn deer, which nigh his cruel graspHad roam'd unheeding through the secret grove:Rapacious o'er the humid brink he stoops,And in the pure and fluid crystal coolsHis reeking jaws. The Thespian warriour here.SEE, valiant friend, Leonidas hath fill'dThe pass with fresh battalions. O surveyYon line of plumed helms, and glitt'ring shields,Which emulate the mid-day sun. What joy!What ardent hope enlightens ev'ry face!O let us wait no longer, lest they cry,Our wearied limbs retard us. Let us arm,And take our station in the glorious van.THUS Dithyrambus. The Plataean chiefApproves the counsel, and resumes his arms.Them as a splendid recompense he boreFrom grateful Athens, when his conqu'ring swordHer domes with great Miltiades redeem'dFrom Asiatic flames. Th' insculptur'd helmNow press'd his manly temples. From on high
A fourfold plumage nodded, and, beneath,A golden dragon with effulgent scalesThe gorgeous crest illumin'd. On his armHis shield he brac'd. Gorgonian serpents twin'dAround the spacious verge. Within, the formOf Pallas, martial goddess, was impress'd.Low, as her feet, the graceful tunic flow'd.Betwixt two gryffins on her helmet satA sphinx with wings expanded, while the faceOf dire Medusa on her bosom frown'd.One hand supports her javelin, which confoundsThe pride of kings; the other leads alongA blooming virgin, Victory, whose browsA crown incircles; laurels she presents;But from her shoulders all her plumes were shorn,With favour'd Athens ever now to rest.This, Asia's terrour, on his mighty arm
Diomedon uprear'd, then snatch'd his lance,And thus to Dithyrambus. Lo! my friend,Alone of all the Grecians, who sustain'dThe morning's battle, still unwearied standPlataea's sons, and well may keep the field,They, who endur'd the Marathonian toil.Then charge with us. Amid the foremost rankThy valour shall be plac'd, and share, this day,Command and honour with Plataea's chief.THE hero ceas'd, and tow'rd the Grecian vanStrides with impetuous steps. Nor slow behindThe boast of Thespia, Dithyrambus mov'd;Like blooming Hermes in celestial arms,When lightly graceful with his feather'd feetAlong Scamander's flow'ry verge he pass'd,To aid th' incens'd divinities of Greece
Against the Phrygian tow'rs. With eager speedThe heroes soon th' imbattled Greeks attain'd,To whom the brave Diomedon began.NOT to contend, but vanquish are you come,And in the blood of fugitives to stainYour lances unoppos'd. My friends, behold,Where furthest from the Malian gulf remov'dThe crags of Oeta less confine the straits.There let us bend extending wide our front.There with more ample scope may havoc range.ALL with assent gave ear. The various bandsMove on successive. The Plataeans firstAgainst the rock are station'd. To their headIs Dithyrambus brought. Exulting joyDistends their hearts, and flashes in their eyes.Thanks to the great Diomedon, they cry,
Who to our troop this godlike hero joins.Hail! Dithyrambus. Hail! illustrious chief.Well dost thou merit to have reap'd renownAt Marathon. Amid the glorious frontWith conscious gladness blushing on his cheekThe youth his post assumes. Around him croudThe hoary warriours their unnumber'd scarsBefore his sight presenting, and recountTheir various dangers. He their wounds surveysWith veneration, nor disdains to hearThe oft-repeated tale. From Sparta's kingReturning, Agis here the chiefs address'd,Leonidas permits you still to braveThe hostile numbers, with Plataea's band,If yet by toil unconquer'd. But I see,That all unwearied ask the promis'd fight.Hail! glorious veterans. This signal day
May your victorious swords augment the wreathsAround your venerable brows, and makeThermopylae, like Marathon, renown'd.THIS said, he hastens back. Meantime advanc'dThe Mantinéan Diophantus brave,And Hegesander, Tegea's dauntless chief,With all their troops imbattled; by their sideThe Thebans form; to them their native filesAlcmaeon and Eupalamus unite;Last on the margin of the Malian bayMycenae's youth Aristobulus drew;In one impenetrable phalanx stretch'dAcross the pass. With close-connected forceAn hundred warriours form'd th' expanded ranks,And thirty bucklers ev'ry file condens'd.In strong reserve Dieneces behind
Dispos'd the Spartans, and the Locrian line.There too with Maron Alpheus dauntless stood,And godlike Agis. There Megistias plac'dHis blooming heir, and thus his valour fires.O MENALIPPUS! born of foreign race,Yet by these heroes not unworthy deem'dWith them to fight for Sparta! lo! the hourIs come, my son, to shew thy gen'rous heart;That not with thee the buckler and the spearAre ill intrusted to maintain a causeSo great and sacred. O remember well,Leonidas on yonder bulwark stands,Who all the war contemplates, and discernsThe bold and fearful. O propitious heav'n!Grant me to hear Leonidas this dayApplaud my son, and let Megistias die!WHILE thus he spake, the animated soulOf Menalippus struggling in his breastDemands the fight. This saw the tender sire,And thus with tears rejoin'd. Remember too!Thy father sees thy danger. Oh! my child!To me thy honour as to thee is dear;Yet court not death! By all thy filial love,By all my cares and fondness I implore!Amid the combat, or the warm pursuit,Still by the wise Dieneces abide:His prudent valour knows th' unerring pathsOf glory; he will guide thy youthful steps.This said, to Sparta's leader he retires.NOW are the enemies descried. The vanAbrocomes and Hyperanthes led,
With them Pandates, Intaphernes proud,Hydarnes, Mindus. Violent their marchWith sounding footsteps swept the stony way.So, where th' unequal globe in mountains swells,A river pours its thund'ring surge betweenThe steep-erected cliffs; tumultuous rollThe torrents bursting o'er the pointed crags:The mountains roar, the marble channel foams.With obvious arms th' intrepid Greeks withstandThe dire encounter. Soon th' impetuous shockOf thousands and of myriads shakes the ground.Stupendous scene of terrour! Under hills,Whose nodding summits vaulted o'er their heads,In unextinguishable fury join'dThe dreadful conflict. With inverted trunksObliquely bending from the shagged ridgeThe sylvan horrours overshade the fight.
The shrill-mouth'd trumpet, and the deep-tun'd horn,Mix'd with the crash of intermingling spears,The clanging shields, and war's discordant shoutsAwake the echoes through the neighb'ring groves;And rocks and shores return the hideous sound.End of the Fourth Book.LEONIDAS. BOOK V.The argument.Hyperanthes discontinuing the fight, while he waits for reinforcements, Teribazus, a Persian remarkable for his merit and learning, and highly belov'd by Hyperanthes, but unhappy in his passion for Ariana, a daughter of Darius, advances from the rest of the army to the rescue of a friend in distress, who lay wounded on the field of battle. Teribazus, is attack'd by Diophantus, the Mantinéan, whom he overcomes, then engaging with Dithyrambus, is himself slain. Hyperanthes hastens to his succour. A general battle ensues. Hyperanthes and Abrocomes, partly by their own valour, and partly by the perfidy of the Thebans, who desert the line, being on the point of forcing the Grecians, are repuls'd by the Lacedaemonians. Hyperanthes composes a select body out of the Persian standing forces, and making an improvement in their discipline renews the attack; upon which Leonidas changes the disposition of his army: Hyperanthes and the ablest Persian generals are driven out of the field, and several thousands of the Barbarians, circumvented in the pass, are entirely destroy'd.AMID the van of Persia was a youthNam'd Teribazus, not for golden stores,Not for wide pastures travers'd o'er with herds,With bleating thousands, or with bounding steeds,Nor yet for pow'r, nor splendid honours fam'd.Rich was his mind in ev'ry art divine,And through the paths of science had he walk'dThe votary of wisdom. In the years,When tender down invests the ruddy cheek,He with the Magi turn'd the hallow'd pageOf Zoroastres; then his tow'ring soulHigh on the plumes of contemplation soar'd,And from the lofty Babylonian faneWith learn'd Chaldaeans trac'd the mystic sphere;There number'd o'er the vivid fires, that gleamUpon the dusky bosom of the night.
Nor on the sands of Ganges were unheardThe Indian sages, from sequester'd bow'rsWhile, as attention wonder'd, they disclos'dThe pow'rs of nature; whether in the woods,The fruitful glebe, or flow'r, or healing plant,The limpid waters, or the ambient air,Or in the purer element of fire.The fertile plains, where great Sesostris reign'd,Mysterious Aegypt next the youth survey'd,From Elephantis, where impetuous NilePrecipitates his waters, to the sea,Which far below receives the sev'nfold stream.Thence o'er th' Ionic coast he stray'd, nor pass'dMilétus by, which once inraptur'd heardThe tongue of Thales, nor Priene's walls,Where Wisdom dwelt with Bias, nor the seatOf Pittacus along the Lesbian shore.
Here too melodious numbers charm'd his ear,Which flow'd from Orpheus, and Musaeus old,And thee, O father of immortal verse,Maeonides, whose strains through ev'ry ageTime with his own eternal lip shall sing.Back to his native Susa then he turn'dHis wandring steps. His merit soon was dearTo Hyperanthes generous and good.And Ariana from Darius sprungWith Hyperanthes, of th' imperial race,Which rul'd th' extent of Asia, in disdainOf all her greatness oft an humble earTo him would bend, and listen to his voice.Her charms, her mind, her virtue he explor'dAdmiring. Soon was admiration chang'dTo love, nor lov'd he sooner, than despair'd.But unreveal'd and silent was his pain;
Nor yet in solitary shades he roam'd,Nor shun'd resort: but o'er his sorrows castA sickly dawn of gladness, and in smilesConceal'd his anguish; while the secret flameRag'd in his bosom, and its peace consum'd:His heart still brooding o'er these mournful thoughts.CAN I, O wisdom, seek relief from thee,Who dost approve my passion? From the pow'rOf beauty only thou wouldst guard my heart.But here thyself art charm'd, where softness, grace,And ev'ry virtue dignify desire;Yet thus to love despairing is to proveThe sharpest sorrow, which relentless FateCan from her store of woes inflict on life:But dost not thou this moment warn my soulTo fly the fatal charmer? Do I pause?
Back to the wise Chaldaeans will I go,Or wander on the Ganges; where to heav'nWith thee my elevated soul shall tow'r,With thee the secrets of the earth unveil.There no tumultuous passion shall molestMy tranquil hours, and ev'ry thought be calm.O wretched Teribazus! all conspiresAgainst thy peace. Our mighty lord preparesTo overwhelm the Grecians. Ev'ry youthAttends the war, and I, who late have poiz'dWith no inglorious arm the soldier's lance,And near the side of Hyperanthes fought,Must join the throng. How therefore can I flyFrom Ariana! who with Asia's queensThe splendid camp of Xerxes will adorn.Then be it so. Again I will adoreHer gentle virtue. Her delightful tongue,
Her graceful sweetness shall again diffuseResistless magic through my ravish'd heart;And thus when love with double rage inflam'dSwells to distraction in my tortur'd breast,Then—But in vain through darkness do I searchMy fate: despair and fortune be my guides.THE hour arriv'd, when Xerxes first advanc'dHis arms from Susa's gates. The Persian dames(So were accustom'd all the eastern fair)In sumptuous cars accompanied his march;And Ariana grac'd the beauteous train.From morn till ev'ning Teribazus guardsHer passing wheels; his arm her weight sustainsWith trembling pleasure often, as she mountsTh' imperial chariot; his assiduous handFrom each pure fountain wafts the living flood:
Nor seldom by the fair-one's soft commandWould he repose him at her feet reclin'd,While o'er his lips her lovely forehead bow'dWon with his grateful eloquence, that sooth'dWith sweet variety the tedious march,Beguiling time. He too would then forgetHis cares awhile, in raptures vain intranc'd,Delusion all, and fleeting rays of joySoon overcast with more intense despair;Like wintry clouds, which op'ning for a timeTinge their black skirts with scatter'd beams of day;Then swiftly closing, on the brows of MornCondense their horrours, and in thickest gloomThe ruddy beauty veil. Such woes oppress'dThe Persian's heart, not soften'd; for this dayHis daring valour from the bleeding vanOppos'd the frown of adamantine Mars.
With no tiara were his temples bound,The slender lance of Asia he disdain'd,And her light target. Eminent he mov'dIn Grecian arms the wonder of his foes.Among th' Ionians had his strenuous limbsIn war been practic'd. A resplendent caskFlam'd on his head. Before his face and chestDown to the knees his ample shield was spread.A pond'rous ash with skillful hands he grasp'd.Thus arm'd, tremendous in the front he stood.Beneath his might two bold Phliasians died,And three Tegeans, whose indignant chief,Brave Hegesander, vengeance breath'd in vainWith streaming wounds repuls'd. Thus far unmatch'dHis strength prevail'd, when Hyperanthes' voiceRecall'd his fainting legions. Now each bandTheir languid courage reinforc'd with rest.
Meantime with Teribazus thus confer'dThe godlike prince. Thou much-deserving youth!O had thy deeds with emulation warm'dThe frozen hearts of Persia, Greece had weptHer prostrate ranks, not triumph'd in our shame.Relaxing now the wearied fight I wait,Till from the camp with Abradates strongThe brave Pharnuchus and Mazaeus move,And with fresh pow'rs renew the drooping war.For since surpass'd in valour, we must wasteBy endless numbers, and continual toilThe matchless ardour of our gallant foes.HE said. Immers'd in sadness scarce replied,But to himself thus plain'd the am'rous youth.STILL do I languish mourning o'er the fame,My arm acquires. O wretched heart! thou seatOf constant sorrow, what deceitful smilesYet canst thou borrow from illusive hopeTo flatter life. At Ariana's feetWhat if with supplicating knees I bow'd,Implor'd her pity, and reveal'd my love?Wretch, canst thou climb to yon effulgent orb,And share the splendours which irradiate heav'n?Dost thou aspire to that exalted maid,Great Xerxes' sister, rivalling the hopesOf Asia's purpled potentates and kings?Unless within her bosom I inspir'dA passion fervent as my own, nay more,Such as might dissipate each virgin fear,And unrestrain'd disclose its fond desire,
My hopes are fruitless. Plung'd in black despairHe thus revolv'd, when suddenly the criesOf Aribaeus smote his pensive ear.By mutual danger, and by friendship join'd,They had been long companions in the toilsOf war. Together with victorious stepsThe sons of Nile they chas'd, when Aegypt's prideBefore the arms of Hyperanthes fell.Stretch'd on the plain, and cover'd o'er with wounds,By all abandon'd, Teribazus viewsHis gallant friend. His languid soul awakes,And forth he issues from the Persian line.The bleeding warriour in his strong embraceSwift he conveys. By indignation fir'dFierce from the Grecians Diophantus rush'dWith loud defiance. Teribazus leavesHis rescu'd friend. His massy targe he rears,
Advances high his formidable spear,And turns intrepid on th' approaching foe.Amazement follow'd. On he strode, and shookThe plumed honours of his shining crest.Th' ill-fated Greek awaits th' unequal fight;Pierc'd in the throat with sounding arms he falls;Through ev'ry band the Mantinéans mourn.Upon the slain the victor fix'd his sight,And thus reflected. By thy splendid armsThou art a Greek of no ignoble rank,And from thy fall perhaps am I adorn'dWith more conspicuous lustre. What if heav'nShould add new victims, like thyself, to graceMy undeserving hand, who knows, but sheMight smile upon my trophies. Oh! vain thought!Disperse ye fantome hopes! Too long, my heart,Hast thou in vain contended with thy woes!
I stand this moment on the verge of life,By fame invited, by despair impell'dTo pass th' irremeable bound. No moreShall Teribazus backward turn his steps,But here decide his fate. Then beat no more,Thou troubled heart, and ev'ry grief be stillNow at th' approach of everlasting peace.HE ended, when a mighty foe drew nigh;Not less than Dithyrambus. E'er they join'd,The Persian thus the Thespian youth address'd.SAY, art not thou th' unconquerable Greek,Whose dauntless valour mow'd our battle down,And scatter'd nations? To attempt thy forceThis day I purpos'd, when our chiefs from fightTheir host withdrew? That now my single arm
Thou deign'st to meet, receive my thanks; and know,The thought of conquest less employs my mind,Than that by thee I cannot fall with shame.HE ceas'd. These words the Thespian chief return'd.Of all the praises from thy gen'rous mouthThe only share, which justice bids me claim,Is, that I here adventure to confrontThy matchless strength. Believe not, that unmark'dWere thy great deeds. From you unbounded campNone yet hath equall'd thy victorious hand.But whence thy armour of the Grecian form?Whence thy tall spear? thy helmet? whence the weightOf that strong shield unlike thy eastern friends?O if thou be'st some fugitive, who, lostTo liberty and virtue, art becomeA tyrant's vile stipendiary; with grief
That valour, thus triumphant, I behold,Which after all its danger, and brave toilDeserves no honour from the Gods, or men.HERE Teribazus with a sigh return'd.I am to Greece a stranger, and a wretchTo thee unknown, who seek, this hour, to die;Though not ignobly, but in death to raiseMy name from darkness, while I end my woes.THE Grecian then. I view thee, and I mourn.A dignity, which virtue only bears,And resolution on thy brow enthron'd(Though grief hath dim'd thy drooping eye) demandMy veneration; and whatever beThe malice of thy fortune, what the cares,Which thus infest thy quiet, they create
Within my breast the pity of a friend:Why hast thou then compell'd me to opposeMy arm against thee, while thy might supportsTh' unjust ambition of malignant kings,The foes to virtue, liberty, and peace?Yet free from rage, or enmity I liftMy adverse javelin. Victory I ask,Thy life may fate for happier hours reserve.THIS said, their beaming lances they protend,Of hostile hate, or fury both devoid;As on the Isthmian, or Olympic sandFor fame alone contending. Either hostPois'd on their spears in silent wonder gaz'd.The fight begins, when soon the Grecian lance,Which all the day in constant battle wornUnnumber'd shields and corselets had transfix'd,
Against the Persian target, shiv'ring breaks,Its master's hand disarming. Then began▪The sense of honour, and the dread of shameTo swell in Dithyrambus. Undismay'dHe grapples with the foe, and instant seiz'dThe threatning javelin, e'er th'uplifted armCould execute the meditated wound.The weapon burst betwixt their struggling hands.They loose their grasp, and bare their shining swords.With equal swiftness to defend, or charge,Each active youth advances, or recedes.On ev'ry side they traverse, now direct,Obliquely now the wheeling blades descend.Still is the conflict dubious, when the GreekDissembling points his falchion to the earth,His arm depress'd, as overcome with toil;While with his buckler cautious he repels
The blows repeated from th' exulting foe.Greece trembles for her hero. Joy pervadesThe Asian ranks, and Hyperanthes stridesBefore the line, preparing to receiveHis friend triumphant. Teribazus nowPress'd with redoubled efforts. Still the GreekSustains th' assault defensive, and at last,As with unguarded fury of his strokesTh' unwary Persian sideways swung his targe,The fatal moment Dithyrambus watch'd,And darting forward with his feet outstretch'dHis falchion buries in th' obnoxious side.Affection, grief, and terrour wing the speedOf Hyperanthes. From his bleeding foeThe Greek retires, not distant, and awaitsThe eastern prince. But he with wat'ry cheeks,And dumb with sorrow clasps his dying friend,
From whose cold lip with interrupted phraseThese accents broke. O dearest, best of men!My heart is fruitful with ten thousand thoughtsOf gratitude and love to thee; but fateDenies my voice the utt'rance. O my friend!O Hyperanthes! hear my tongue unfold.What thou shouldst ne'er have known before this hour;When, as I open all my secret soul,I may at once retire, and veil my eyesIn endless night: nor thou presumption deemWhat with my dying breath I here divulge.I love thy sister. With despair I lov'd,And thence perhaps untimely is my date;Though, witness heav'n, without regret I bleedWith honour thus in Persia's sight and thine.HE ceas'd: th' inexorable hand of FateWeigh'd down his eyelids, and the gloom of deathHis fleeting sight eternally o'ershades.Him on Choaspes o'er the blooming vergeHis frantic mother shall bewail, and strewHer silver tresses in the crystal tide;While all the shore re-echoes to the nameOf Teribazus lost. Th' afflicted princeThe pallid corse contemplating with tears,Thus in the bitterness of grief exclaims.OH! Teribazus. Oh! my friend, whose lossI will deplore for ever. Oh! what pow'rTo me and thee averse thus clos'd thy breastTo Hyperanthes with distrust unkind.She should, she must have lov'd thee. Now no more
Thy friendly aspect shall delight my eyes,While in remembrance thy unequall'd worthWill live for ever to remind my griefOf what I lost. O Susa, if againThee I revisit from this hostile land,Far from the clamours of tumultuous war,Then shall my hours be vacant to complaint,Whole years shalt thou be witness, while I mourn,And Ariana shall assist my woes.Let fiercest vengeance now possess my soul.HE said, and ardent rushes on the Greek,Who, while his noble enemy expir'd,And Hyperanthes snatch'd with tender armsThe last embraces from his gasping friend,Stood near reclin'd in sadness o'er his shield,And in the pride of victory repin'd,
Nor mark'd his threatning foe: when swift approach'dDiomedon. Before the Thespian youthAloft he rais'd his targe, and loudly thus.HOLD thee, Barbarian, from a life more worth,Than thee, and Xerxes, with his host of slaves.HIS words he seconds with his rapid lance.Soon a tremendous conflict had ensu'd,But Intaphernes, Mindus, and the halfOf Persia's leaders anxious for the lifeOf Hyperanthes pour'd with all their bandsBetwixt th' encountring chiefs. With mutual wrathThey strove in vain the combat to renew.So rage two bulls upon th' opposing banksOf some deep flood, which parts the fruitful mead;
Defiance thunders from their angry mouthsIn vain; in vain the furrow'd earth they rend:Wide rolls the stream, and intercepts the war.The fierce Plataean satiates his revengeOn vulgar lives. Before his dreaded armWhole ranks are scatter'd. But the Persian princeBorne down the stress of battle gains the shore,Where then the brave Abrocomes advanc'd;With him Orontes and Pharnuchus stood,Mazaeus, Abradates fam'd in arms,And all the boldest of the eastern chiefsBegirt with fresh battalions: here with speedAbrocomes his brother thus bespake.TO Intaphernes is Pandates sentWith charge to harrass in perpetual fightThe Grecians next the mountains. Thou with me
And these unite thy valour. Here the flow'rOf all our army is together drawn,Here all the weight of battle will impend.He said. The godlike Hyperanthes seeksThe dang'rous van. He heads the splendid throngOf satraps, princes, and imperial pow'rs;Themselves the lords of nations, who beforeThe throne of Xerxes tributary bow'd.Now mix'd the war. Th' inverted javelins gleamFrom ev'ry part, and fell Bellona roars.WHO first distain'd with Persian blood his sword?Eupalamus. Artembares he slewAnd Derdas fierce, whom Caucasus had rear'dOn its tempestuous brow, the savage sonsOf violence and rapine; but their doomGreat Hyperanthes marks: his angry lance
Arrests the victor in his haughty course.Beneath the strong Abrocomes o'erwhelm'd,Melissus swells the number of the dead.None could Mycenae boast of prouder birthThan young Melissus; blooming, as the sonOf Maia, all in radiant arms he grac'dThe front of battle; he in Cirrha's vale,Where high Parnassus from its double topO'ershades the Pythian games, the envied prizeOf fame obtain'd: low sinks his laurell'd headIn death's cold night, and horrid gore deformsHis graceful locks. Impatient for revengeAristobulus strides before the van.A storm of fury darkens all his brow.Around he rolls his gloomy eye, and marksAchaemenes for death, of regal bloodDeriv'd from Croesus, once th' imperial lord
Of nations; him the nymphs of Halys wept,When with delusive oracles beguil'dBy Delphi's God, he pass'd their fatal wavesA mighty empire to dissolve: nor knewTh' ill-destin'd king, that envious Fortune watch'dThat dreadful moment from his hand to wrestThe scepter of his fathers. In the shadeOf humble life his race on Tmolus' browLay hid, 'till rous'd to battle here his breathAchaemenes resigns. Then Lycis bledFor horrid war ill-chosen. He was skill'dTo tune the lulling flute, and melt the heart;Or with his pipe's awak'ning strains inviteThe lovely dames of Lydia to the dance:They graceful o'er the verdant level mov'dIn varied measures, while the cooling breezeBeneath their swelling garments wanton'd o'er
Their snowy breasts, and smooth Cayster's waveSoft-gliding murmur'd by. His op'ning chestPours forth his entrails, and supine he falls.Not long the Grecian triumphs. From the slainIn all the pride of conquest as he rendsHis reeking javelin, Hyperanthes' steelHis knee invades, and bursts the sinewy cords.The Mycenaeans with uplifted shields,Corinthians, and Phliasians gather roundThe wounded Grecian. With redoubled rageThe conflict glows. Abrocomes incitesEach Persian leader; all obey his voice;Here Abradates, there Mazaeus press'd,Orontes, and Hydarnes; none retireFrom toil, or peril: urg'd on ev'ry sideThe Greeks at length th' abandon'd chief resign.Despairing, raging, destitute he stands
Propt on his spear; his wound forbids retreat.None, but his brother Eumenes, abideThe dire extremity. His shield defendsThe fainting chief, till Hyperanthes' swordFull on his arm its dreadful weight discharg'd.Down with the buckler drops the sever'd hand,Nor quits its grasp. Now sink the wretched pairBeneath the Persian's unresisted steel:From both their breasts the vital currents flow,And mix their streams. Elate the Persians rollTheir deepning legions on the foes dismay'd.The Greeks their station painfully maintain.This soon the faithless Anaxander saw,When thus to Leontiades he spake.THIS is the time to aid our Persian friends.Behold the Greeks are press'd. Let Thebes retire,And yield a bloodless conquest to the king.THE Thebans streight desert the broken lineNot with unpunish'd treachery; the spearsOf fierce Orontes, and Pharnuchus join'dWith Mindus gor'd their shameful flight, and thin'dTheir bleeding files. Meantime, as he who rul'dThan Jove more antient on the throne of heav'n,When from the womb of Chaos dark the worldEmerg'd to birth, where'er he view'd the jarOf atoms yet discordant and unform'd,Confusion thence with pow'rful voice dispell'd,Till light and order universal reign'd;So from the wall Leonidas explor'dThe various war. He saw the Theban rout,That Corinth, Phlius, and Mycenae look'dAffrighted backward; instantly he charg'dThe sons of Lacedaemon to repair
The disunited phalanx. E'er they moveDieneces inspires them. Fame, my friends,Calls forth your valour in a signal hour;For you this glorious period she reserv'dTo vindicate the Spartan name. He spake.On either side supported by the mightOf Agis and of Alpheus he conductsHis gen'rous troop, who riveting their shieldsIn dense array indissolubly firmConfront the Persians, and with death repulseTheir scatter'd numbers; when with efforts vainThey oft renew'd the contest, and recoil'dAs oft confounded with diminish'd ranks,Thus Hyperanthes counsell'd. Learn, O chiefs,From whence alone success can grace our arms.These are a band selected from the Greeks,Unlike the others, whom we lately chas'd;
Perhaps the Spartans, whom we oft have heardBy Demaratus prais'd. To break their lineFalse is the hope, while unarray'd, and lax,And wanting union singly we assailTheir strength collected. Do not we presideO'er Asia's myriads, and our valour boast,And martial arts above the vulgar herd?Let us, ye chiefs, attempt in order'd ranksTo join our force, and emulate the foe.THEY wait not dubious. Soon a dreadful lineFrom Oeta's mountain to the shore extends,Compos'd of all the leaders, Mindus bold,Pharnuchus, and Mazaeus, and the strengthOf fierce Abrocomes, with each, who boreThe highest honours, and excell'd in war.To these succeed a chosen number drawn
From those, whom Asia boasts her bravest sons,Who from their king perpetual stipends share;And station'd round his provinces by armsHis tyranny sustain. In ev'ry partIs Hyperanthes seen with active careTo form the huge battalion. Soon they standIn just array, when cautious, lest their marchMight still relax their order, Persia's princeAmid the center of the foremost rankOrontes plac'd, committing to his handTh' imperial standard; whose expanded foldsGlow'd in the air, presenting to the sunThe richest dye of Tyre: the royal birdAmid the gorgeous tincture shone exprestIn flaming gold. On this the eastern chiefCommands each Persian station'd in the frontTo turn his eyes regardful, and to guide
His slow and equal feet by this aloneRetiring, or advancing. Next he charg'd,That ev'ry warriour through the num'rous files,Observing none but those before him rang'd,Should watch their motions, and their steps pursue.Close by the standard then th' intrepid chiefHis post assumes, and animates the band.ILLUSTRIOUS warriours, whose unconquer'd armsRebellious Aegypt, and the Libyan felt,Think what the splendour of your former deedsFrom you demands; remember, from the greatHeroic actions are a debt to fame.No middle course remains for them to tread,Whom she hath once ennobled; and this hourOr with fresh trophies will enlarge your praise,Or will for ever with dishonour blast.THE hero said, and all to fight proceed.As when tempestuous Eurus stems the weightOf western Neptune struggling through the straits,Which bound Alcides' labours; here the stormWith rapid wing reverberates the tide,There the contending surge with furrow'd topsTo mountains swells, and whelming o'er the beachOn either coast invests with hoary foamThe Mauritanian and Iberian strand:Not with less rage in hideous onset meetThe Grecians and Barbarians. These preserveTheir formost ranks unbroken, where was drawnThe prime of Asia's warriours; and the croud,Though still promiscuous pouring from behind,Yet added pressure to th' imbattled chiefsWith endless numbers. Like the mural strength
Of some proud city bulwark'd round, and arm'dWith rising tow'rs to guard her wealthy stores;Immoveable, impenetrable stoodThe serried phalanx of the Greeks. Behind,Their country spread, their fields with plenty crown'd,Their native walls and habitations layWith each dear pledge of friendship and of love.High in the Persian van th' exalted lanceOf Hyperanthes flam'd. Beside him press'dAbrocomes, Hydarnes, and the bulkOf Abradates terrible in war.And here the great Dieneces upheldHis shield's expanded surface, and aloneFirm, as a Memphian pyramid, sustain'dThe stress of thousands. Alpheus here unmov'd,And Agis there connect their spacious orbs,With Menalippus wise Megisthias' heir
In one impervious line. Long time the hostsMaintain in strong and unrelax'd arrayThe conflict undecided; nor could GreeceRepel the adverse numbers, nor the forceOf Asia's myriads could remove the Greeks.BUT now from Sparta's king, who soon discern'dThe Persian's new arrangement, Medon hastes,Th' illustrious chief of Locris, from the raceOf Ajax sprung in Trojan fields renown'd:To wife Dieneces he thus began.LEONIDAS commands the Grecian lineTo yield before the Persians, and with speedTo measure back some paces. Soon, he deems,The unexperienc'd foe in wild pursuitWill break their order. Then the charge renew;
Let Agis, join'd with Alpheus, from the lineRush with Laconia's troop imbattled deep,And force a passage through the Barb'rous host;Thou with a strong battalion from the sonsOf Locris drawn must follow swift, and reachThe Spartans led by Agis; with the restOf Locris' youth shall I advance to fillYour vacant station, and the line maintain;While in the narrow entrance, where the passLooks o'er the Malian plain on Persia's camp,Do thou arrange to intercept the foe,Should Asia pour fresh succours from her tents:Then Xerxes soon the slaughter shall deploreOf all these thousands in the straits inclos'dFor sure destruction; and the Gods of GreeceBehold their temples with profusion grac'd
Of splendid off'rings from Barbarian spoilsWon by their free-born supplicants this day.THIS heard, Dieneces obedient gaveThrough ev'ry band the signal of retreat,When all at once drew backward. Persia stop'd,As with amazement rooted to the earthAt unexpected conquest; 'till the voiceOf fierce Abrocomes their minds awakesWith these triumphant accents. By the sunThey fly before us. My victorious friends,Delay you then to enter Greece? Away,Rush on undaunted. I already hear,Our horse and chariots thund'ring o'er their plains,And view their towns involv'd in Persian fires.HE said. With hurried violence they rollTumultuous forward. All with headlong paceWide from their ranks expatiate in pursuit,Disjoin their order, and the line dissolve.This when the sage Dieneces descries,The Grecians halt returning to the chargeWith sudden onset. In a moment, pierc'dBy Lacedaemon's chief, Orontes falls,And quits th' imperial banner; this the GreekIn triumph waves, and gives the dreadful sign.At once with Agis tow'ring in the front,And rapid Alpheus all Laconia's bandIn deep arrangement bursting from the lineBear down with irresistible careerThe eastern legions, shatter'd and o'erturn'dWith all their standards trampled on the plain.
As the swift vessel, when a rising galeDistends the canvass, its resistless courseImpells through millions of opposing waves;Through the Barbarian multitudes so pierc'dThe Spartan wedge. Invincible o'er hillsOf arms, and mangled corses they impressTheir crimson footsteps. Persia's bravest chiefs,Ev'n Hyperanthes from the line is driv'n;And flying thousands through the pass are sweptBefore the Spartans. With a Locrian troopOf hideous depth Dieneces pursuesHis conqu'ring friends, and hews his purple wayThrough Asia's numbers, which again were clos'dIn vain: himself unconquerable leadsDestruction on, and heaps the rock with death.But on the broken foe what ruin fallsFrom Alpheus' sword? O'er all in swift pursuit
Was he renown'd. His rapid feet had match'dThe son of Peleus in the dusty course,Or had he run for Atalanta's love,He had rejected Cytheraea's aid;Nor of her swiftness to beguile the fairBefore her steps had thrown the golden balls.But now the wrongs, the long-remember'd wrongsOf Polydorus animate his strengthWith tenfold vigour; guided by revengeHis falchion reddens with Barbarian blood;The gory drops besprinkled all his shield,Like crimson poppies o'er the yellow plain.As when with horrour wing'd a whirlwind rendsA shatter'd navy; from the ocean cast,Th' enormous fragments hide the sandy beach:Thus o'er the rock the Persians lay bestrewnBy Alpheus raging in the swift pursuit.
Not with severer pangs the God of dayThe Theban queen afflicted, when incens'dWith her proud vaunts he hurl'd her blooming raceFrom youth and beauty to the pale abodes;Than now distracted Hyperanthes' soul,As round him, bleeding by the Spartan's lance,His noblest friends lay gasping. Oft he stroveTo turn his flying legions, oft the fightWith Abradates and his brother's forceRenews, against insuperable foesIn vain repugnant; till by all aroundDeserted, mixing with the gen'ral routHe yields to fortune, and the field forsakes.So with relapsing waves the ebbing tideBeats for a time against the shelving strand,Still by degrees retiring, and at lastWithin the bosom of the main subsides.NOW at Thermopylae's extremest boundThe Spartans check'd their progress. Soon approach'dDieneces, and thus began. Behold,What numbers have we pass'd of Perfia's sons.Be swift, my friends, and form. He said, and fill'dThe narrow straits with order'd files, a depthOf fifty warriours; half on Asia's host,Half tow'rd the pass were turn'd, a double front,Where ev'ry rank with twenty javelins flam'd.The Locrian band to Agis is assign'd,Who stands prepar'd to stop the flying foes;Dieneces himself to Persia's campPresents the terrours of the Spartan steel.NOW, Muse, the wond'rous stratagem display,Which Sparta's hero, whose presiding care
Mark'd all the great vicissitudes of fight,And rul'd the course of slaughter, had conceiv'dTo whelm the num'rous, long-resisting foeIn hideous death, and signalize the dayWith horrours new to war. As o'er the wall,His constant station, darting through the straitsHis watchful eye, e'er yet the battle clos'd,He view'd the hostile myriads swarming down,And nations still succeeding from the campImmense, exhaustless, by an horrid lengthOf clust'ring helms, and shields, and threatning spearsJoin'd to the Grecian van; the wary chief,Lest by the long-protracted fight his GreeksMight yield o'erlabour'd, from the Locrians choseA thousand warriours. These by Maron ledAscend the mountain, which o'erhung the pass.His charge he soon reveals. A thousand hands
At once with restless pains assemble stonesOf hugest bulk, and wither'd trunks uptornIn elder times by whirlwinds from the grove.Unwearied then they loosen from the rocksBroad, craggy fragments; from the mountain hew'dIts venerable firs, and aged oaksOf wide circumference, and knotted strength,Which of their branches by the lightning bared,Presented still against its blasting flameTheir hoary pride unshaken. These the GreeksRoll heavy on, with massy leavers heave,Or drag with strong-knit cables, till they reach,Where o'er the Persian multitudes inclin'dThe mountain's edge; so lofty, that the voiceOf war below there lost its deafning roar,And soften'd into murmurs. Still his post,Though Hyperanthes from the field was driv'n,
With thronging numbers Intaphernes boldBeneath the shade of this incumbent hillAgainst the fierce Diomedon maintain'd;Great Intaphernes, progeny of kings,Whom o'er Damascus, and the Syrian palmsHad Xerxes seated with despotic swayHis substitute. This Maron from on highSurveys, and gives the signal; downward sinksThe nodding pile, stupendous heap of death!Trees roll'd on trees with mingled rock descend,Unintermitted ruin. Loud resoundThe hollow trunks against the mountain's side,Swift bounds each craggy mass. The foes beneathLook up aghast, with horrour shrink, and die;Whole legions crush'd beneath the dreadful heapsLie hid and lost, as never they had knownA name, or being; while around them grew
A hill of ruin. Numbers still survive,Who shun destruction with impetuous flight;But Agis stops them: Intaphernes fallsBefore his thund'ring arm. Again they turnTo meet resistless ruin. From behindWith twice two hundred Locrians Agis pours.MEANTIME the Grecian line (so Sparta's kingDecreed) had left its station, and beyondThe heaps of dreadful carnage was advanc'd;There, stretch'd from Oeta to the Malian bay,The Locrians led by Medon had dispos'd,With Corinth, Phlius and Mycenae's trainTheir hostile phalanx o'er the less'ning pass.Along the mountain's side Plataea's troop,The Mantinéans, and Tegaeans stood,
An horrid length of war. Th' unwearied swordsOf Dithyrambus and DiomedonStill blaz'd the terrour of the Barb'rous host.Before them fled the Persians to the shore,All in a moment by the various bandsOf Greece surrounded. From the gulph profoundPerdition here inevitable frowns,And there, incircled by a grove of spears,They stand devoted hecatombs to Mars.Now not a moment's interval delaysTheir gen'ral doom, but down the Malian steepProne are they hurried to th' expanded armsOf Horrour rising from the op'ning deep,And grasping all their numbers, as they fall.The dire confusion, like a storm, invadesThe chafing billows; loud resounds the shore:
And o'er whole troops by fell Bellona roll'dIn one vast ruin from the craggy ridge,O'er all their arms and ensigns deep ingulph'd,With hideous roar the surge for ever clos'd.End of the Fifth Book.LEONIDAS. BOOK VI.The argument.Night coming on, the Grecians retire to their tents. A guard is plac'd on the Phocian wall under the command of Agis. He admits into the camp a lady accompanied by a single slave, and conducts them to Leonidas; when she discovers herself to be Ariana, sister of Xerxes and Hyperanthes, and sues for the body of Teribazus; which being found among the slain, she kills herself upon it. The slave, who attended her, proves to be Polydorus, brother of Alpheus and Maron, and who had been formerly carried into captivity by a Phoenician pirate. He relates before an assembly of the chiefs a message from Demaratus to the Spartans, which discloses the treachery of the Thebans, and of Epialtes, the Malian, who had undertaken to lead part of the Persian army through a pass among the mountains of Oeta. This information throws the council into a great tumult, which is pacified by Leonidas, who sends Alpheus to observe the motions of these Persians, and Dieneces with a party of Lacedaemonians to support the Phocians, with whom the defence of these passages in the hills had been intrusted. In the mean time Agis sends the bodies of Teribazus and Ariana to the camp of Xerxes.IN sable pomp with all her starry trainThe night assum'd her throne. Recall'd from warHer long-protracted labours Greece forgets,Dissolv'd in silent slumber; all but those,Who watch'd th' uncertain perils of the dark,An hundred warriours: Agis was their chief.High on the wall intent the hero sat,As o'er the surface of the tranquil mainAlong its undulating breast the windThe various din of Asia's host convey'dIn one deep murmur swelling in his ear:When by the sound of footsteps down the passAlarm'd he calls aloud. What feet are those,Which beat the echoing pavement of the rock?With speed reply, nor tempt your instant fate.HE said, and thus return'd a voice unknown.Not with the feet of enemies we come,But crave admittance with a friendly tongue.THE Spartan answers. Through the midnight shadeWhat purpose draws your wandring steps abroad?TO whom the stranger. We are friends to Greece,And to the presence of the Spartan kingAdmission we implore. The cautious chiefOf Lacedaemon hesitates again.When thus with accents musically sweetA tender voice his wondring ear allur'd.O GEN'ROUS Grecian, listen to the pray'rOf one distress'd! whom grief alone hath led
In this dark hour to these victorious tents,A wretched woman innocent of fraud.THE Greek descending through th'unfolded gatesUpheld a flaming brand. One first appear'dIn servile garb attir'd; but near his sideA woman graceful and majestic stood;Not with an aspect rivalling the powerOf fatal Hellen, or the wanton charmsOf Love's soft queen; but such as far excell'd,Whate'er the lilly blending with the rosePaints on the cheek of beauty soon to fade;Such as express'd a mind, which wisdom rul'd,And sweetness temper'd, virtue's purest lightIllumining the countenance divine,Yet could not sooth remorseless fate, nor teachMalignant Fortune to revere the good,
Which oft with anguish rends the spotless heart,And oft associates wisdom with despair.In courteous phrase began the chief humane.EXALTED fair, who thus adorn'st the night,Forbear to blame the vigilance of war,And to the laws of rigid Mars impute,That I thus long unwilling have delay'dBefore the great Leonidas to placeThis your apparent dignity and worth.HE spake, and gently to the lofty tentOf Sparta's king the lovely stranger guides.At Agis' summons with a mantle broadHis mighty limbs Leonidas infolds,And quits his couch. In wonder he surveysTh' illustrious virgin, whom his presence aw'd:
Her eye submissive to the ground inclin'dWith veneration of the godlike man.But soon his voice her anxious dread dispell'd,Benevolent and hospitable thus.THY form alone, thus amiable and great,Thy mind delineates, and from all commandsSupreme regard. Relate, thou noble dame,By what relentless destiny compell'd,Thy tender feet the paths of darkness tread.Rehearse th' afflictions, whence thy virtue mourns.ON her wan cheek a sudden blush arose,Like day's first dawn upon the twilight pale,And wrapt in grief these words a passage broke.IF to be most unhappy, and to know,That hope is irrecoverably fled;If to be great and wretched may deserveCommiseration from the good; behold,Thou glorious leader of unconquer'd bands,Behold descended from Darius' loinsTh' afflicted Ariana, and my pray'rAccept with pity, nor my tears disdain!First, that I lov'd the best of human race,By nature's hand with ev'ry virtue form'd,Heroic, wise, adorn'd with ev'ry art;Of shame unconscious does my heart reveal.This day in Grecian arms conspicuous cladHe fought, he fell. A passion long conceal'dFor me alas! within my brother's armsHis dying breath resigning, he disclos'd.—OH I will stay my sorrows! will forbidMy eyes to stream before thee, and my heart,Thus full of anguish, will from sighs restrain!For why should thy humanity be griev'dWith my distress, and learn from me to mournThe lot of nature doom'd to care and pain!Hear then, O king, and grant my sole request,To seek his body in the heaps of slain.THUS to the Spartan su'd the regal maidResembling Ceres in majestic woe,When, supplicant at Jove's resplendent throne,From dreary Pluto, and th'infernal gloomHer lov'd and lost Proserpina she sought.Fix'd on the weeping queen with stedfast eyes,Laconia's chief these tender thoughts recall'd.SUCH are thy sorrows, O for ever dear!Who now at Lacedaemon dost deploreMy everlasting absence! then inclin'dHis head, and sigh'd; nor yet forgot to chargeHis friend, the gentle Agis, through the straitsThe Persian princess to attend and aid.With careful steps they seek her lover's corse.The Greeks remember'd, where by Fate repress'dHis arm first ceas'd to mow their legions down,And from beneath a mass of Persian slainSoon drew the hero by his armour known.To Agis' high pavilion they resort.Now, Ariana, what transcending pangsThy soul involv'd? What horrour clasp'd thy heart?But love grew mightiest, and her beauteous limbsOn the cold breast of Teribazus threw
The grief-distracted maid. The clotted goreDeform'd her snowy bosom. O'er his woundsLoose flow'd her hair, and bubbling from her eyesImpetuous sorrow lav'd the purple clay.When forth in groans her lamentations broke.O TORN for ever from my weeping eyes!Thou, who despairing to obtain her heart,Who then most lov'd thee, didst untimely yieldThy life to Fate's inevitable dartFor her, who now in agony unfoldsHer tender bosom, and repeats her vowsTo thy deaf ear, who fondly to her ownNow clasps thy breast insensible and cold.Alas! do those unmoving, ghastly orbsPerceive my gushing anguish! Does that heart,Which Death's inanimating hand hath chill'd,
Share in my suff'rings, and return my sighs!—Oh! bitter unsurmountable distress!Lo! on thy breast is Ariana bow'd,Hangs o'er thy face, unites her cheek to thineNot now to listen with enchanted earsTo thy persuasive eloquence, no moreCharm'd with the wisdom of thy copious mind!SHE could no more. Invincible despairSuppress'd her utt'rance. As a marble formFix'd on the solemn sepulcher, unmov'dO'er some dead hero, whom his country lov'd,Bends down the head with imitated woe:So paus'd the princess o'er the breathless clay,Intranc'd in sorrow. On the dreary wound,Where Dithyrambus' sword was deepest plung'd,Mute for a space and motionless she gaz'd.
Then with a look unchang'd, nor trembling handDrew forth a poniard, which her garment veil'd,And sheathing in her heart th' abhorred steel,On her slain lover, silent sinks in death.In vain the Spartan interven'd. With tearsHe view'd the prostrate lovers, and exclaim'd.OH! most unhappy, heavy on your headsHath sorrow fall'n, which o'er your pale remainsCommands this pity from a stranger's eye!Illustrious ruins, may the grave impartThat peace, which life denied! And now receiveThis pious office from a hand unknown.SO saying, from his shoulders he unclasp'dHis ample robe, and strew'd the waving foldsO'er the pale dead. Then turning, he bespake
The slave, who stood beside him. Thou, who ledstThy queen ill-destin'd to the fatal tentsOf Lacedaemon, now returning bearHer bleeding reliques to the Persian lord;Thou, and these captives, whom I free from bonds.ART thou a Spartan (interrupts the slave)And dost thou counsel me to seek againA clime unbless'd, where freedom never dwells?No. Bear me to Leonidas. AloneShall he decide, if wretched, as I seem,I may not claim protection from this camp.WHOE'ER thou art (amaz'd the chief replies)Thou may'st indeed a better lot demand,Than I, a stranger to thy hidden worth,Unconscious offer'd. Thy ignoble garb
Conceal'd a virtue, which I now revere.And since thy suff'ring soul hath long indur'dThe gloom of bondage, and the hated faceOf tyrants view'd, now change the horrid scene;Here freedom reigns, and justice: come and seekWith me their great protector. Ending here,Swift he conducts him to Laconia's king,When Agis thus Leonidas address'd.LO! far superiour to the name, which marksHis habit with dishonour, one, who suesFor thy protection! Here the slave subjoin'd.I stand thy suppliant now. Thou soon shalt learn,If I deserve thy favour. I intreatTo see th' assembled leaders of your host,For I am fraught with tydings, which importThe weal of all the Grecians. Agis streight
Appointed by Leonidas convenesThe various leaders. To the tent they throng,Amidst them plac'd, the stranger thus began.O ALPHEUS! Maron! hither turn your sight,And know your brothers. From their seats they start.From either burst, with tears of transport mix'd,The name of Polydorus. On his breastEach fondly strives to rush, but he withstands;While down his cheek a stream of anguish poursFrom his dejected eyes in torture bentOn that vile garb, which sham'd his free-born limbs.At length these accents intermix'd with groansBroke from his heart, while all stood wond'ring round.YOU first shall know, if this unhappy slaveYet merits your embraces. Now approach'd
Leonidas. Before him all recede,Ev'n Alpheus' self; and yields his brother's hand,Which in his own the gen'rous hero press'd:Then with majestic goodness thus bespakeTh' afflicted youth, and mitigates his pains.FORBEAR to mourn, thou unexampled youth.Thy friends, thy country, all on thee shall gazeWith veneration, whose unshaken mindThe chains of Asia never could debase.Lo! ev'ry breast is open to thy worth,Each tongue prepares to hail thee with applause,Who hast thy country honour'd ev'n in bonds.HE ceas'd, when Alpheus with an eager handDivests his brother of his base attire,And his own mantle o'er the shoulders threw
Of Polydorus. Agis too advanc'd,With friendly arms infolds him, and began.Now, in thy native liberty secure,Smile on thy past afflictions, and relate,What chance restor'd thy virtue to the Greeks.THEN Polydorus to the list'ning chiefs.I was a Spartan. When my tender primeOn manhood border'd, from my native shoreSnatch'd by Phoenician pirates, I was sold,To Ariana, sister to the kingAnd Hyperanthes. Fortune there was kindMy bonds committing to that gentle hand.Yet was I still a captive, and estrang'dFrom Lacedaemon. Demaratus oftWith friendly sorrows would my lot deplore,
Nor less his own ill-fated virtue mourn'dLost to his country in a servile court,The center of corruption; where in smilesIs envy painted, treachery, and hate,And rankling malice; where alone sincereThe dissolute seeks no disguise: where heWho all possesses, that a king can give,Is far less happy than the meanest sonOf liberty, and groveling, as the slave,Who serves his cruel pride. Yet here the sunTen times his annual period hath renew'd,Since Polydorus hath in bondage groan'd.My bloom now past, or else by pining careUntimely wither'd, I at last return,And to my native land the tydings bearOf instant desolation. Here in griefHe paus'd, when thus Leonidas. Proceed.
Though from thy lips inevitable fateTo all be threaten'd, thou art heard by none,Whose dauntless souls can entertain a thought,But how to fall the noblest. Thus the chief.The rest in speechless expectation wait.Such was the solemn silence, which o'erspreadThe shrine of Ammon, or Dodona's shades,When anxious mortals from the mouth of JoveTheir doom explor'd. Nor Polydorus longSuspends the Grecians, but resumes his tale.AS I this night accompanied the stepsOf Ariana, e'er we reach'd the straitsBefore our view then op'ning, one appear'dWith hasty feet now traversing the way,Now fix'd intensely tow'rds the Grecian wall;Then on a sudden starting would renew
His restless pace. As nearer we approach'd,He by the moon, which glimmer'd o'er our heads,Descried us, when advancing he demandsWhere bent our midnight course. I knew the voiceOf Demaratus. To my breast I clasp'dThe venerable exile, and replied.Our purpose ask not. Sparta's camp we seek,And oh! farewel for ever! He rejoin'd.Thrice happy Polydorus! Thou againShalt visit Sparta to these eyes denied.Upon your paths may heav'n's protection smile.Soon as you mix with yon triumphant tents,Say to the Spartans, whose unconquer'd armsDefend those rocks, you saw their exil'd king;Say, though their blind credulity depriv'dThe wretched Demaratus of his home,From ev'ry joy secluded, which awaits
The parent and the husband, from his wife,His offspring torn, his friends, and native gates,Him from his virtue could they ne'er divide:Say, that ev'n here, where all are kings, or slaves,Amid the riot of flagitious courtsNot quite extinct the Spartan spirit glowsWithin his breast, though grief hath dim'd its fires.Remembring this to Lacedaemon's chiefReport, that newly to the Persian hostReturn'd a Malian, Epialtes nam'd,Who as a spy had sought the Grecian tents.He to the tyrant magnified his art,Which with delusive eloquence had wroughtThe Greeks to such despair, that Asia's kingHad been e'er now their sov'reign master own'd,Had not the spirit of their single chief,By fear unconquer'd, and on death resolv'd,
Restor'd their valour: therefore would the kingTrust to his guidance a selected band,They soon should pierce th' unguarded bounds of Greece,Led through a secret passage o'er the hills,Where no Leonidas should bar their way.Meantime by him the treach'rous Thebans sentAssurance of their aid. Th' assenting kingAt once decreed two myriads to advanceWith Hyperanthes, with Abrocomes,And bold Hydarnes. Ev'ry chief besides,Whom youth, or valour, or ambition warms,Rous'd by the traitor's eloquence, attendsFrom all the nations, fir'd with eager zealThe first to enter Greece. In silence nowThe youth remains. Tremendous from his seatUprose Plataea's chief. His eyes were flames,
And thus on trembling Anaxander burstThe furious accents from his livid lips.YET e'er we fall, O traitor, shall this armTo hell's avenging furies sink thy head.ALL now is tumult, ev'ry bosom swellsWith rage untam'd, and vengeance. Half unsheath'dDiomedon's impetuous falchion blaz'd.But, as the Cholchian sorceress renown'dIn fables old, or Circe, when they fram'dA potent spell from Erebus to wakeThe dead in dark and fleeting forms to glideBefore the moon's dim twilight, with their charmsSmooth'd all the sea, and silenc'd each rude blast;Till not a billow heav'd against the shore,Nor ev'n the wanton-winged zephir breath'd
The lightest whisper through the magic air:So, when thy voice, Leonidas, is heard,Fell Discord listens; Rage with sacred aweSubsides in silence; while Confusion slept.WITHHOLD this rashness (interpos'd the king)Before we punish, let us find the guilt.Not yet hath Persia overturn'd our tents,Not yet her Barb'rous shouts our ears alarm.We still have time for vengeance, and to know,If yet our swords destruction may repel,Or how to die most glorious. Then aroseDieneces, and thus the Greeks bespake.E'ER yet they pass our borders, Xerxes' hostMust learn to conquer, and the Greeks to fly.The spears of Phocis guard the secret pass.
Let instant messengers be thither sentTo know the Persians progress. Alpheus here.LEONIDAS, behold, my willing feetShall to the Phocians bear thy great commands,Or climb the hills to mark th' approaching foe.THOU active son of valour (thus returnsThe chief of Lacedaemon) in my thoughtsFor ever present, when the public causeDemands the swift, the vigilant, and bold!Go and surmount the rocks aërial height.And while, around, Dieneces conductsAn hundred Spartans to the Phocians aid,Thou from the hills observe the Persians march.BEFORE the purple-winged morn the nightRetiring warn'd their conference to cease.
They all disperse. When hastning on his course,And ready now to climb the lofty crags,O Polydorus, Alpheus thus exclaims,Long lost and late recover'd! we must partOnce more, and now for ever. Thou return,And kiss the sacred soil, which gave thee birth,Which calls thee back to freedom? Dearest youthI should have tears to give thee—but farewel!My country chides me loit'ring in thy arms.THIS said, he quits his brother, and ascends,While Polydorus answers. Alpheus no.I have the marks of bondage to erase,My blood must wash the shameful stain away.WE have a father (Maron interpos'd)Thy unexpected presence will revive
His heavy age, that childless else will mourn.Here Polydorus with a gloomy smile.ILL should I comfort others. View these eyes;Faint is their light, and vanish'd is my bloomBefore its hour of ripeness. In my breastGrief as a native will for ever dwell,Nor yield to time. Unceasing shall my soulBrood o'er the dire remembrance of my youthIn servitude thus wasted. Life with meHath lost its savour. Then in silent woeHe hangs his head. His brother pleads in vain.He answers only with repeated groans.Now in his view Dieneces advanc'dWith Sparta's band. On them his eyes are fix'dImmoveable, and thus his mind revolves.I TOO, like these, in Lacedaemon sprung,Instructed once, like these, to poize the spear,And lift the pond'rous shield. Ill-destin'd wretch!Thy arm is now enervate, and would failBeneath the buckler's weight. O cruel Heav'n!Who didst compel my free-born hand to changeThe warriour's arms for ignominious bonds;Wouldst thou compensate for my chains, my shame,My ten years sorrows, and the black despair,Which on my youth has prey'd; propitious onceGrant, I may bear my buckler to the field,And known a Spartan seek the shades below.HE ceas'd, and sudden turn'd his steps asideTo find the tent of Agis; there the youth
With grateful sorrow ministers his aid,While with a kind and hospitable handThe gentle Agis by her lover's corseOn one sad bier the pallid beauties laidOf Ariana. He from shackles freesTwo Persian captives, whom his gen'rous armThat day preserv'd from slaughter, then began.TO you I give that freedom, which you soughtTo snatch from me. This recompense I ask,And this alone. Transport to Asia's campThese bleeding reliques; bid the Persian kingWeep o'er this flow'r thus blasted in its pride;Then say, th' all-judging Gods have thus ordain'd:Thou, whose ambition o'er the groaning earthLeads desolation, o'er the nations spreads
Calamity and tears, thou first shalt mourn,And through thy house destruction first shall range.THUS charg'd, to Asia's host the captives bend.They soon attain the Phocian wall, where nowWas Dithyrambus station'd. He perceivesThe mournful bier approach. To him the fateOf Ariana was already told.He meets the captives, when, with weeping eyesOn Teribazus turn'd, he thus exclaims.O! AS thy arms present thee, hadst thou beenIndeed a Grecian! then thy gen'rous heartIts valour ne'er had wasted to supportA king's injustice; then a gentler fate,Had bless'd thy life, or bleeding thou hadst known,
How sweet is death for liberty. A GreekThis friendly wish affords thee, though his headHad lost the honours gather'd from thy fall;When fortune favour'd, or propitious heav'nSmil'd on the better cause. Ill-fated pair!Whom with this stream of pity here I lave;But that my hostile hands imbru'd with goreMust be ungrateful to your loathing shades,From all the neighb'ring valleys would I cullTheir fairest growth, and strew your hearse with flow'rs.Yet O accept these tears and pious pray'rs!May peace attend your ashes! may your shadesPass o'er the silent pool to happier seats,Where tyrants ne'er can enter to molestThe blissful region; but are far remov'd
To realms of horrour, where from righteous heav'nThey bear those pains, they merit from mankind!HE ceas'd in tears. The captives leave the wall,And slowly down Thermopylae proceed.End of the Sixth Book.LEONIDAS. BOOK VII.The argument.The bodies of Teribazus and Ariana are brought into the presence of Xerxes, soon after a report had reach'd the camp, that half his navy was shipwreck'd. The Persian monarch, quite dispirited, is persuaded by Argestes, one of the satraps, to send an ambassador to the Spartan king. Argestes himself is deputed, who, after revealing his ambassy to Leonidas in secret, is by him led before the whole army, and there receives his answer. In the mean time Alpheus returns and declares, that the enemies were possess'd of the passages in the hills, and were hastening to Thermopylae, upon which Leonidas offers to send away all the army except his three hundred Spartans; but Diomedon, Demophilus, Dithyrambus, and Megistias refuse to depart: he then dismisses Argestes, informs the Grecians of his design to attack the Persian camp in the night, and making all the necessary dispositions retires to his pavilion.BEFORE the tent of Xerxes now arriv'dThe Persian captives. On with solemn paceAnd slow they move. The monarch from afarDescries their sad demeanour. They approach,Nor he forbids. That morn had Rumour toldThe loss of half his navy dash'd on rocksBy angry blasts, or buried in the surge.Thus, when his bleeding sister met his eyes,Already sunk in sadness, he had lostHis kingly pride, the parent of disdain,And cold indifference for others woes;Nor ev'n beside his sister's nobler corseHer humble lover now his scorn awak'd.In tears the captive's mournful tale he heard,And then first knew compassion; but e'er longThose traces vanish'd from the tyrant's breast:
His former gloom redoubles, for himselfHis anxious bosom heaves, and now he fears,Lest he with all his numbers should be castA prey to Fortune. Near the monarch stoodThe Spartan exile, whom he thus bespake.O DEMARATUS, what will fate ordain!Lo! Fortune turns against me! Who shall knowHow far her daring malice may extend,Which rages now so near me, and hath madeMy house the seat of ruin? I have sentFrom my unshelter'd side my bravest chiefs,And choicest troops to pass the desart hill,Led by this Malian; may not there the GreeksWith opposition more tremendous stillAnd ruinous, than yester sun beheld,Resistless hold their craggy post; renew
Their stony thunder with augmented rage,And send whole quarries down the rocky steepAgain to crush my legions? Oh! unfoldThy secret soul, nor hide the harshest truth;Say what remains to hope? The exile here.IF truth unblam'd may issue from my lips,Too well, imperial Xerxes, you presageWhat may befal your legions. If the GreeksArrang'd within Thermopylae, a passAccessible and spacious, could repelWith such destruction their unnumber'd foes;What scenes of havoc must th' untrodden paths,Confin'd among the craggy hills, afford?IMMERS'D in care the monarch silent sat.Amid th' incircling peers Argestes stood.
A potent prince. On Sipylus he reign'd.Whose lofty summits overlook'd the wavesOf Hermus and Pactolus; either streamEnrich'd with golden sands its tribute boreTo this great satrap: through the servile courtYet was there none more practic'd in the artsOf mean submission; none more skill'd to gainThe royal favour; none, who better knewThe phrase, the looks, and gesture of a slave.In soothing words he thus the king bespake.IF Xerxes will to spare his faithful bands,And not exert the terrours of his pow'r;More gentle means of conquest than by arms,Nor less secure may artifice supply.Renown'd Darius, thy imperial sireGreat in the spoil of kingdoms, long in vain
The fields of proud Euphrates with his hostO'erspread; at length confiding in the wilesOf Zopyrus the mighty king subdu'dThe Babylonian tow'rs: but who shall count,What num'rous states by policy have fall'n;And let corruption once her aid impart,Not one shall stand. What race of men possessSuch probity and wisdom, whom the veilOf craft may blind not, nor corruption's charmSeduce. O Xerxes, thou, whom heav'n hath rais'dTo more than mortal greatness, canst thou findThrough all thy empire, which from India's shoreShall reach Eurotas soon, no dazzling giftTo gain the Grecian leader? O dispelThe cloud of sadness from those sacred eyes,And proffer streight to Lacedaemon's chief,What may thy own munificence declare,
And win his sword to aid thee. Xerxes here,Rous'd from his trance of sorrow, swift replied.WISE are thy words and counsels. Go, repair,My faithful servant, to the Grecian chief;Fall down before him; bid him join our arms,And he shall reign o'er all the Grecian states.AT once Argestes leaves the monarch's side.He now approaches to the Phocian wall.Thence Dithyrambus leads him to the tentOf Lacedaemon's king. Retreated thereAlone the hero meditating satOn future woes to Persia. At his feetProne bows Argestes, and begun. Thus lowBefore thy awful presence Xerxes wills,That I should bend me prostrate to the earth,
And thus accost thee. Great and matchless chief,By fortune favour'd, and belov'd by heav'n,Thus says the lord of Asia; join our arms,And we reward thee with the sov'reign ruleO'er all the pow'rful states of haughty Greece.And, O illustrious warriour, heed my words.Think on the bliss of royalty, the pompOf courts, their endless pleasures, trains of slaves,Who restless watch for thee and thy delights,With all the glories of unrivall'd sway.Look on th' Ionic and Aeolian GreeksFrom them their fantom liberty is flown,While in each province, rais'd by Xerxes' hand,Some favour'd chief presides (exalted state,Which envious freedom gives not) on his headHe bears the gorgeous diadem, and seesHis equals once now prostrate at his throne.
Yet how much greater thou, whom gen'ral Greece,That teems with mightiest states, shall call her lord,Thee only worthy. How will Greece rejoiceAround thy throne, and hail th' auspicious hour,When thou, selected by the Persian kingTo bless consenting nations with thy sway,Didst calm the fury of unsparing war,Which else had delug'd all with blood and flames!HE said. The chief replies not, but commandsThe Thespian youth, who near the tent had watch'd,To summon all the Grecians. He obeys.While from his seat the hero mov'd, and badeThe Persian follow. He amaz'd attends,Surrounded soon by all the Grecian bands;When him the godlike Spartan thus bespake.HERE, Persian, tell thy ambassy, repeat,That to obtain my friendship Asia's lordBids me accept the sov'reignty of Greece;Then view this band, whose valour shall preserveThat Greece unconquer'd, which your king bestows,And strew your bodies on its crimson plains:The indignation painted on their looks,And gen'rous scorn shall answer for their chief.THE hero ceas'd, when suddenly return'dThe speed of Alpheus; all suspended streightOn him direct their sight, who thus began.E'ER I could join the Phocians, from the hill,Which overhung the close defile, I view'dThe pow'rs of Persia. Down the narrow strait
No sooner gleam'd th' innumerable spears,But by our angry destiny misled,Or some curst daemon, enemy to Greece,The Phocians quit their station. Through the passAn inundation of Barbarians pours,The traitor Epialtes is their guide,And to Thermopylae directs their course.HE here concludes. Unutterable fearIn horrid silence wrapt the list'ning throng,Aghast, confounded; silent too were those,Who knew no terrour, yet with wonder mute,Thick-wedg'd inclos'd Leonidas around,Who thus with calmest elocution spoke.I NOW behold my destiny compleat,And how at last Leonidas must die.
Here with the Spartans shall I rest behindWhile you, my faithful, brave allies, retreat.Then art thou near, thou glorious, sacred hour,Which shalt my country's liberty confirm!All hail! thou solemn period! thee the tonguesOf Virtue, Fame, and Freedom shall record,And celebrate in ages yet unborn.Then O farewel, Megistias wise and brave;Thou too experienc'd, venerable chief,Demophilus farewel: farewel to theeInvincible Diomedon, to theeUnequall'd Dithyrambus, and to all,You other dauntless warriours, who may claimPraise from my lips, and friendship from my heart,You after all the wonders, which your swordsHave here accomplish'd, shall enrich your namesWith fresh renown. Your valour must compleat,
What we begin. Here first th' astonish'd foeA dying Spartan shall with terrour view,And tremble, while he conquers; then, by fateLed from his dreadful victory dismay'dAgainst the phalanx of united Greece,By your unconquer'd spears himself shall fall.HERE interpos'd the fierce Plataean chief.By the twelve Gods enthron'd in heav'n supreme,By my fair name unsullied yet I swear,Ne'er shall thy eyes, Leonidas, beholdDiomedon forsake thee. First let strengthDesert my limbs, and valour shun my heart.Did I not face the Marathonian war?Have I not seen Thermopylae? O Fame,What more canst thou bestow, or I receive?Where can I living purchase brighter praise,
Than dying here? A more illustrious tombWhere can I gain, than underneath the heapsOf Persians fall'n the victims of our sword.He ended, when Demophilus subjoin'd.O KING of Sparta, pride of human race,Whom none e'er equall'd, but the seed of Jove,Thy own forefather number'd with the Gods,Lo! I am old. With faltring steps I treadThe prone descent of years. The winged hoursBy me, as one unequal to their speed,Who can no more their fleeting joys attain,Unheeding slide. My youth my country claim'd,My age no more can serve her; what remains?What eligible hope can wisdom form,But to die well? Upon this glorious earthWith thee, unrivall'd hero, will I close
The eve of life. So spake the hoary chief,When Dithyrambus next. O first of Greeks,Me too think worthy to attend thy fameWith this most dear and venerable manFor ever honour'd from my tend'rest age,Ev'n till on life's extremity we part.Nor too aspiring let my hopes be deem'd;Should the Barbarian in his triumphs markMy youthful limbs among the gory heaps,Thence may his fears be doubled, when againHe meets in fields hereafter to be knownThe Grecian standards, trembling at a foe,To whom the flow'r, and blooming joys of lifeAre less alluring than a noble fate.TO him Demophilus. Wilt thou too bleed,My Dithyrambus?—But I here withhold
All counsel from thee, who art wise, as brave.If then thy magnanimity retainThee too with great Leonidas to fall,At either's side our limbs shall press the ground,And drop together in the arms of Death;So if th' attentive traveller we drawTo our cold reliques, wondring shall he traceThe diff'rent scene, and pregnant with applause,O wise old man, exclaim, thou well hast choseThe hour of fate: and O unequall'd youth,Who to thy country didst thy bloom devote,Mayst thou remain for ever dear to Fame!May Time rejoice to name thee! and may PeaceWith gentlest pinions hover o'er thy urn!THIS said, the hero with his lifted shieldHis face o'ershades, and drops a secret tear;
Not this the tear of anguish, but deriv'dFrom fond affection grown mature with time;Which in a feebler mind to pain had turn'd,But in the Thespian's firm and virtuous breast,Alone a manly tenderness awak'dUnmix'd with pity, or with vain regret.MEGISTIAS last address'd the Spartan chief.Thou, whom the Gods have chosen to exaltAbove mankind in virtue and renown,O call not me presumptuous, who imploreAmong these heroes thy regardful ear!To Lacedaemon I a stranger came.You there preserv'd me, there with honours clad;Nor have I yet one benefit repay'd.That now the gen'rous Spartans may behold
In me their high beneficence not vain,Here to their cause I consecrate my breath.NOT so Megistias (interpos'd the king)Thou and thy son retreat. Again the seer.FORBID it, thou eternally ador'd,O Jove, confirm my persevering soul!Nor let my fear neglect this happy hourTo shew the Spartans, I deserv'd their care.Thou, Menalippus, hear the king's command,And my paternal tenderness revere.Do thou withdraw thee from me, to my handThy arms resigning. Fortune will supplyFresh toil for valour. Vanquish then, or findA glorious grave; but spare thy father's eyeThe bitter anguish to behold thy youth
Untimely bleed before him. Grief suspendsHis speech, and interchangeably their armsImpart their last embraces. Either wept,The hoary parent, and the blooming son.But from his temples the pontific wreathMegistias now unloosens, and resignsHis hallow'd vestments; while the youth with tearsThe helmet buckles o'er his snowy locks,And on his breast adjusts the radiant mail.WHILE such contempt of life, such fervid zealTo die with glory animate the Greeks,Far other thoughts possess Argestes' soul.Amaze with mingled terrour smote his heart;Cold drops, distill'd from ev'ry pore, bedewHis shiv'ring limbs; his bosom pants; his kneesYield to their burthen; ghastly pale his cheeks,
Pale are his lips and trembling: such the mindsOf slaves corrupt, to them the beauteous faceOf Virtue turns to horrour. But the chiefOf Lacedaemon now the wretch bespake.RETURN to Xerxes; tell him on this rockThe Grecians faithful to their post awaitHis chosen myriads; tell him, thou hast seen,How far the lust of empire is belowA free-born mind: and tell him, to beholdA tyrant humbled, and by virtuous deathTo seal my country's freedom, is a goodSurpassing all, his boasted pow'r can give.HE said, the Persian hastens through the pass.But now once more Diomedon arose.Wrath overcasts his forehead, while he spake.YET more must stay and bleed. Inglorious ThebesNe'er shall receive her traitors back, but hereShall they attone their perfidy by deathEv'n from their swords, to whom their abject heartsHave sacrific'd their faith. Nor dare to hope,Ye vile deserters of the public weal,Ye coward slaves, that mingled with the heapsOf those, who perish in their country's cause,You shall your shame conceal. Whoe'er shall passAlong this field of glorious slain, and traceWith veneration ev'ry nobler corse;His soul, though warm with generous applause,A while shall curb the transport to repeatIts execrations o'er your impious heads,On whom that fate, which gives to others fame,Is infamy and vengeance. Dreadful thus
On the pale Thebans sentence he pronounc'd,Like Rhadamanthus, from th' infernal throneWhen with inexorable frowns he doom'dThe guilty dead to ever-during pain;While Phlegethon its flaming billows roll'dBefore their sight, and ruthless furies shookTheir hissing serpents. All the Greeks assentWith clamours echoing through the concave rock.FORTH Anaxander in th'assembly stood,And thus began with indignation feign'd.If yet your clamours, Grecians, are allay'd,Behold, I stand before you to demand,Why these my brave companions, who aloneOf all the Thebans under my commandDurst force their passage through dissuading croudsTo join your host, should now be traitors deem'd;
Accus'd by one alone, a banish'd wretch,Whom Lacedaemon in her anger droveFar from her confines; one, who meanly soughtA servile court for shelter: has he drawnSuch virtues thence, that Sparta, who beforeHeld him unworthy of his native soil,Should trust him now before auxiliar friends?Injurious Greeks! we scorn the thought of flight.Let Asia bring her millions; unconstrain'dWe wait the conflict, and for Greece will die.THUS in the garb of virtue he adorn'dNecessity, deluding ev'ry GreekExcept Laconia's hero. He perceiv'dThrough all its fair disguise the traitor's heart.So, when at first mankind in science rudeRever'd the moon, as bright with native beams,
Some sage, that walk'd with Nature through her works,By Wisdom led, discern'd, the various orbItself was dark, in foreign splendours clad.Now unexpected with his troop return'dDieneces, and thus to Sparta's king.I NEED not tell thee, that the Persian pow'rsHave pass'd the secret strait. This night they halt,But with the morning will invade us here.We come to die with thee. United thus,Our strength a fiercer contest shall maintain;Whence a more bright example to our friends,And stronger terrour of the Grecian name.HE said, when thus Leonidas began.O Spartans, hear, and all you other Greeks,Whose matchless virtue shall inroll your names
In Time's eternal records, and inhanceYour country's lustre; lo! the setting sunInflames the broad horizon. All retire,And in your tents invoke the pow'r of sleepTo aid your vigour, and to give your limbsUnwearied patience of continued toil;But when the second watch begins, let allWith mutual exhortation rouse to arms:For soon, as Cynthia from the vault of heav'nHath hung her shining lamp, through Asia's hostShall death with horrour and amazement rage.Their camp is open to our swords, depriv'dOf all its chosen warriours. But I chargeAll, ev'n the Spartans, who are maim'd, or weak,To pain, or toil unequal, from our campThis hour to hasten. You, our brave alliesOf Corinth, Phlius, with th' Arcadian bands
And Mycenaeans must not yet return,But here, while we repose, in arms remain;When we our tents abandon, then depart.HE said, all heard obedient, and dispers'd;While to his tent the godlike chief repairs,And with him Agis, whom he thus bespake.O AGIS, hear and mark my last command,With wary skill dispose the nightly guard,That no deserter from the Theban tentsMay reach the camp of Asia, or ascendTo those now halting on the neighb'ring hills:Nor yet with us the faithless band must join.Not with such base associates must we trustOur great design. Their perfidy might soonFind means to rouse the unsuspecting foe,
And all our glorious enterprise confound.Then, O my faithful Agis, e'er we move,While on the solemn sacrifice intent,As Lacedaemon's sacred laws ordain,Our pray'rs we offer to the tuneful nine,Do thou in whispers charge the Theban trainSlow and in silence to disperse and fly.This said, they parted. On his couch aloneReclines the hero, where he thus revolves.MY fate is now impending. O my heart!What more auspicious period could I chuseFor death, than now; when beating high with joyThou tell'st me, I am happy? If to live,Or die, as Virtue dictates, be to knowThe purest bliss; if she her charms displayStill beauteous, still unfading, still serene
To youth, to age, to death; whatever beThose other climes of uncorruptive joy,Which Heav'n in dark futurity conceals,Still here, O Virtue, thou art all our good.Then what a black, unspeakable reverseThe wretched offspring of Injustice prove?What in the struggle of departing day,When life's last glimpse extinguishing presentsTh' unknown, inextricable gloom of death?But can I paint the terrours of a breast,Where guilt resides? Leonidas foregoThe horrible conception, seek againThy own untroubled heart, and grateful bowTo those benignant pow'rs, who fram'd thy mindIn crimes unfruitful, never to admitThe black impression of a guilty thought.Else could I fearless thus relinquish life?
No. Such unshaken calmness from th' unjustIs ever absent. Oft in them the rageOf some prevailing passion for a timeSuppresses fear. Oft hurried on they loseThe sense of danger, when dominion, pow'r,And purple pomp their dazzled sight enchant.Yet still the joys of life alone they seek.But he, who calmly meets resistless fate,When glory only, and the gen'ral goodInvite him forward, must possess a soul,Which all content deducing from itselfCan by unerring virtue's constant lightDiscern, when death is worthy of his choice.The man thus great and happy, in the scopeOf his large mind is stretch'd beyond his date;Ev'n on this shore of being he in thought
Supremely bless'd anticipates the good,Which late posterity from him derives.THE hero clos'd his meditation here.The swelling transports of his mind subsideIn soft oblivion, while the silken plumesOf sleep envelop his extended limbs.End of the Seventh Book.LEONIDAS. BOOK VIII.The argument.Leonidas rising about three hours before midnight relates to an assembly of the leaders a dream, which is interpreted by Megistias; he then arms himself, and marches in procession with his whole troop to an altar newly rais'd on a neighbouring meadow, and there offers a sacrifice to the Muses: he invokes the assistance of those Goddesses, he animates his companions, and then placing himself at their head leads them against the enemy in the dead of the night.SCARCE was begun the second watch of night,When his pavilion Agis left, and soughtThe chief of Lacedaemon. Him he foundSpread on his tranquil couch, while, o'er his face
Diffus'd, a glad serenity with smilesHis slumber painted; like an ev'ning skyYet streak'd with ruddy light, when summer sunsHave veil'd their beaming foreheads. Transport fill'dThe eye of Agis. Friendship swell'd his heart,And veneration. On his knee inclin'dThe hero's hand he kiss'd, and thus began.O THOU with more than human virtues great,Accept this homage! and may gentle sleepYet longer close thy eyelids, that unblam'dI thus may bow before thee. Thus he spake,And, prostrate bent, his godlike friend rever'd,Whose eye the shades of slumber now forsake.So, when new rising heav'n's resplendent orbIllumines first the sable skirts of night,The white-rob'd Magi, or the Indian seers
Are seen from Ganges, or Euphrates' side,Before th' emerging glory bow'd to hailThe radiant emblem of th' immortal mind.BOTH heroes rose, and mix'd their friendly arms,And now to Agis had the Spartan kingDisclos'd his soul; when lo! the Grecian chiefs,All rous'd, advancing with the sudden gleamOf armour pierc'd the twilight shade. With joyLeonidas accosts them. O thrice hail!My virtuous friends. Approach, and all attend,While I relate, and you with wonder hear.This night no sooner sleep oppress'd my brows,But o'er my head the empyreal formOf my great sire Alcides seem'd display'd.I saw his magnitude divine; his voiceI heard, his solemn mandate to arise.
I rose. He bade me follow: I obey'd.Up to a mountain, whose ethereal browTh' involving clouds divided, we ascend.E'er long we rested, suddenly the howlOf wolves, and dogs, the vulture's piercing shriek,The yell of ev'ry beast and fowl of prey,Within my ears discordant broke. I turn'd.When lo! a surface all with gore deform'dBeyond my view illimitable stretch'd,One vast expanse of horrour. There a corse,Which with its huge dimensions seem'd to hideTh' unbounded plain, lay welt'ring, red with woundsDelv'd in th' enormous limbs, which bleeding gorg'dThe vulture's famine. Wond'ring I beheld,When from behind I heard a second sound,Like surges trembling o'er a craggy shore.Again I turn'd. An ocean there appear'd
With riven keels, and shrouds, and shiver'd oars,With arms, and mangled carcases bestrewnInnumerous. The billows foam'd with blood,And whelm'd a crimson deluge o'er the strand.But where the waters unobserv'd beforeBetween two adverse shores contracting roll'dA stormy tide, upon the beach, forlorn,One of majestic stature I descriedIn ornaments imperial. Oft on meHe bent his clouded eye-balls. On my nameWith imprecations oft he call'd aloud,Then rent his splendid garments, and his headIn rage divested of its graceful hairs.Impatient now he ey'd a slender skiff,Which mounted on the curling foam approach'd.With indignation, and reluctant griefOnce more his sight reverting, he embark'd
Amid the perils of the frowning waves.O thou, whose virtue rank'd thee with the Gods(I here exclaim'd) instruct me what produc'dThis desolation; when the God return'd.Let thy astonish'd eye again reviewWhat thou didst late abhor. I look'd and sawA land, where Plenty with disporting handPour'd all the fruits of Amalthea's horn;Where bloom'd the olive, and the clustring vineWith its broad foliage mantled ev'ry hill;Where Ceres with exuberance inrob'dThe pregnant bosom of the fields in gold;Where spacious towns, whose circuits proud contain'dThe dazling works of wealth, unnumber'd shone,The strength and splendour of the peopled land.Then in a moment clouds obscur'd my sight,And all was vanish'd from my waking eyes.THRICE we salute the omen (thus beganThe sage Megistias) in thy mystic dreamI see the Grecian victories. The earth,The deep shall own their triumphs; and the tearsOf Asia, and of Lybia shall bewailTheir offspring cast before the vulture's beak,And all the monstrous natives of the main.Those joyous fields of plenty shall be GreeceEnrich'd with conquest, and Barbarian spoils.And whom thou saw'st in regal vesture cladPrint on the sands his solitary steps,Is Xerxes foil'd and fugitive from Greece.MEGISTIAS thus, while ev'ry bosom feltEnthusiastic rapture, joy beyondAll sense, and all conception but of those,
Who die to save their country. Here againLeonidas th' exulting chiefs address'd.SINCE happiness from virtue is deriv'd,Who for his country dies, that moment provesMost happy, as most virtuous. Such our lot.To this the gods shall add eternal fame.But now go forth, Megistias, and with speedPrepare the victim, and the sacred flames;That to the Muses, as the Spartan lawCommands, our pray'rs and off'rings may be paid,E'er to yon camp our hostile feet we bend.But, O remember, from the solemn ritesLet ev'ry sound be absent, not the pipe,Nor ev'n the music-breathing flute be heard.Meantime, ye leaders, ev'ry band instructTo move in silence, nor with shouts alarm
The midnight stillness. Mindful of their chargeThe chiefs depart. Leonidas providesHis various armour. First the breastplate armsHis ample chest. O'er this the hero spreadsThe mailed cuirass from his shoulders hung.The shining belt infolds his mighty loins.Next on his stately temples he erectsThe plumed helm, then grasps his pond'rous shield;Where nigh the center on the swelling brassTh' inimitable artist had imboss'dThe shape of great Alcides, whom to gainTwo Goddesses contended. Pleasure hereWon with soft wiles th' attracted eye, and thereThe form of Virtue dignified the scene.In her majestic sweetness was disclos'dThe mind sublime and happy. From her lipsSeem'd eloquence to flow. With looks serene,
But fix'd intent upon the son of Jove,She wav'd her hand, where winding to the skiesHer paths ascended. On the summit stoodFame, and protended her eternal trump,Incumbent on a trophy near to heav'n.The youth attentive to her wisdom own'dThe prevalence of Virtue; while his eyeWith all the spirit, which redeem'd the worldFrom tyranny and monsters, ardent flam'd;Not undescried by Pleasure, where she layStretch'd on a gorgeous carpet, which bespreadThe meadow with magnificence. AroundWere flourets strewn, and wantonly in rillsSoft streams maeander'd. All relax'd her limbs:Nor wanting yet solicitude to gain,What lost she fear'd, as struggling with despairShe seem'd collecting all her power of charms,
And with excess of sweet allurement smil'd:In vain; for Virtue sway'd Alcides' mind.Hence all his labours. Trac'd with various artThey fill'd the surface of the spacious targe.This portraiture of glory on his armLeonidas supports. Then forth he tow'rsFrom his pavilion. With their troops array'dThe chiefs attended. Flaming torches blaz'dIn ev'ry hand. And now with silent paceAll to the solemn sacrifice proceed.First Polydorus with the hallow'd knife,And barley strew'd with sacred salt advanc'd.Diomedon beside him, in his graspA weighty mace sustaining. Like the restAll bright in armour with his shield and spearMegistias follow'd, an unspotted priest,And dauntless warriour. From on high his helm
With wreaths around the shining crest reveal'dHis sacerdotal honours. By the horns,Where laurels twin'd, with Alpheus Maron leadsThe consecrated ox. And lo! behindLeonidas approaches. Ne'er beforeWith such transcending majesty he trod,Nor his own virtue, as that hour, enjoy'd.Then venerable moves the Thespian chief,And great Dieneces. To them the bloomOf Dithyrambus glowing with the senseOf future praise succeeds, with graceful stepsThe gen'rous Agis next; the Thebans lastRepining and inglorious. Then slow marchThe host all mute, nor shake their brazen arms.NOT from Thermopylae remote the hillsOf Oeta yielding to a fruitful dale
Within their side half-circling had inclos'dA fair expanse with verdure smooth. The boundsWere edg'd with wood o'erlook'd by snowy cliffs,Which from the clouds bent frowning. From a rockAbove the loftiest summit of the grovesA tumbling torrent wore the shagged stone,Then gleaming through the interwoven shadeThe valley water'd. O'er the level shoneIts glassy bosom, and with placid wavesThe smiling lawn divided. Near the banks,Which flow'rs made various, new-erected stoodA rustic altar, which a chosen train,Appointed by Megistias, rais'd with turfCut by their falchions from the verdant mead:Broad was the surface, high with piles of wood,The plenteous tribute of th' adjacent groves,All interspers'd with laurel. Here a vase
Fill'd with the briny waters of the sea,(More pure than ev'ry stream, or fountain, deem'd)Was plac'd beside the altar. There with wineUnmix'd capacious goblets stood arrang'd.Here is the victim brought. Megistias streightHis helm unloosens. With his hoary headUncover'd round the solemn pile he treads,And with a branch of laurel scatters wideThe sacred moisture of the main. His handWith mingled salt and barley next bestrewsThe altar, and the victim. O'er the hornsTh' inverted goblet foaming with the grapeDiffus'd the rich libation. Now advanc'dDiomedon. Megistias gave command.Down sunk the victim with a deathful stroke,Nor groan'd. Megistias buries in the throatThe hallow'd steel. A crimson deluge flows.
Swift from the limbs the fuming hide is torn,The flesh dissever'd on the altar heap'd.Now smoaks the pile, then sudden flames abroad.A burst of splendour dissipates the dark.Greece throngs around. Each lifts a sparkling brandWith beaming javelins intermix'd, and shields,And polish'd helms, which multiply the blaze.Meantime the great Leonidas drew nigh,And stood before the altar. There his helmUnclasp'd to Agis he commits, his shieldAnd spear to Dithyrambus, then his armsExtending thus in supplication spoke.HARMONIOUS daughters of Olympian Jove,Who on the top of Helicon ador'd,And high Parnassus, with delighted earsBend to the warble of Castalia's wave,
And Aganippe's murmurs, if from thenceWe must invoke your presence; or alongThe ridge of neighb'ring Pindus if your stepsNow wander through your consecrated bow'rs,Thence turn, ye Muses, nor for once disdainEach with her beauteous form these hills to grace,And stand th' immortal witness of our fate!But with you bring fair Liberty, whom JoveAnd you most honour. Let her sacred eyesApprove her dying Grecians, let her voiceWith exultation tell the earth and heav'ns,These are her sons; then strike your tuneful shells,And with our praise bid harmony rejoice.Record us guardians of our parents age,Our matrons virtue, and our infants bloom,And glorious bulwarks of our country's laws,Who shall enoble the historian's page,
Or on the joyous festival inspireWith loftier strains the virgins choral song.Then, O celestial maids, on yonder campLet night sit heavy, and a sleep, like death,Weigh down the eye of Asia! O infuseA cool, untroubled spirit in our breasts,Which may in silence guide our daring feetThrough all the paths of slaughter, nor affrightThe dark with tumult, till the dying groansOf gasping tyrants into horrour wakeThe midnight calm! Then turn Destruction wild.Bid Terrour and Confusion revel round,And in one carnage heap the Barb'rous ranks,Their horse, and chariots. Let the spurning steedImbrue his hoofs with blood, and shatter'd carsCrush with their brazen weight the prostrate necksOf kings, and purpled chiefs incircled round
By nations fall'n.—You, countrymen and friends,My last commands attend. Your gen'ral's voiceOnce more salutes you, not to rouse the brave,Or minds resolv'd and dauntless to confirm.Too well by this expiring blaze I viewImpatient valour flash from ev'ry eye.But temper well your ardour, and your lipsClose on the rising transport. Lo! how sleepHath folded millions in its black embrace.No sound is wasted from th' unnumber'd foe.The winds themselves are silent. All conspiresTo this great sacrifice, where thousands soonShall only wake to die. Perhaps our swordsThis night may send ev'n Xerxes' self to leadTh' innumerable train of Persian ghostsTo Pluto's dreery shade, unless reserv'dFrom all this ruin, to lament his shame,
And future flight, when Greece confounds that pow'r,Which we will shake. But now the second watchIs verging to its period, and the moonPrepares to glimmer on our darksome steps.Let each his head distinguish with a wreathOf twining laurel, then the goblet crown,And share the victim. Take your last repast,For with your fathers, and the heroes oldYou next shall banquet in the blest abodes.WHILE thus the hero, through the thronging filesPresenting round a hideous depth of warAll shook with ardour their erected spearsThick, as the fruitful growth of lofty pines,Which from high Pelion's cloud-invested browTo heav'n's blue vault their stately honours bear.Megistias soon through all the band dividesThe sacred laurel: snatch'd with eager zeal,
By ev'ry hand, and round each helmet woveIt blends its verdure with the floating plumes.Then is the victim portion'd, while the bowlFlows with the vine's impurpled stream. AloofThe Theban train in wan dejection muteBrood o'er their shame, or cast a frighted eyeOn that determin'd virtue, which unmov'dAt fate's approach with chearful lips could tasteThe sparkling goblet, and with joy partakeThat last and glorious banquet. Ev'n the heartOf Anaxander now forgets its wiles,Its fear no more dissembling. Agis hereFor ever mindful of his friend's commandMix'd with the Thebans, and in whispers thus.LEONIDAS permits you to retire.While in the rites of sacrifice employ'd
None heed your motions. Separate, and flyWith silent steps. At once the Theban troopIts ranks dissolving from the Greeks withdraws.Unseen it moulders from the host, like snow,Which from the mountains in ten thousand rills,Soon as the sun exerts his orient beam,Descends soft-trickling, while the hoary heapInsensibly decays. The Grecians soonConclude the solemn banquet, and their chiefNow reassumes his arms. Before his stepThe croud rolls backward. In their gladden'd sightHis crest irradiate with th' uplifted brandsIts purple splendour shakes. The tow'ring oakThus from a lofty promontory wavesIts majesty of verdure, while with joyThe sailor marks its heav'n-ascending pride,Which from afar directs his foamy course
Along the pathless Ocean: so the GreeksExulting gaz'd, as down their op'ning ranksTheir chief proceeds; from whose majestic graceA soul like thine, O Phidias, might conceiveIn Parian marble, or effulgent brass,The form of great Apollo; when the God,Won by the pray'rs of man's afflicted race,In arms forsook his lucid throne to pierceThe monster Python in the Delphian vale.Close by the hero Polydorus waitsTo guide destruction through the Asian tents.As the young eagle near his parent's sideIn wanton flight essays his vig'rous wings,E'er long with her to penetrate the clouds,To dart impetuous on the fleecy train,And dye his beak with gore; by Sparta's kingThe injur'd Polydorus thus prepares
His arm for death, and feasts his angry soulWith promis'd vengeance: his impatient thoughtsEv'n now transport him furious to the seatOf his long sorrows not with shackled hands,But now once more a Spartan with his shield,And dreadful spear to lead his country's bands,And with them vengeance. Nor the rest of GreeceNeglect to form. Their helmets now uniteTheir various plumage, as th' intwining boughsMix their broad foliage in Dodona's grove;Or like the cedars on the Syrian hills,Which with their shady texture, as with night,The gloomy soil o'ercast. In order'd ranksWhile thus they stand, behold a warlike formIn gleaming arms slow-moving through the shade,Led by a slave, approach'd Laconia's king,And thus address'd him. O Leonidas,
Thou seest before thee Eurytus, a nameTo thee and ev'ry Spartan not unknown.Thy ruling voice forbade the maim'd to stay;I, whose dark orbs no longer know the sun,Immers'd in sudden blindness since our marchFrom Lacedaemon, with the rest withdrew,Not to revisit Sparta, but, resolv'dTo meet the Persians, in the public wayI sat; not long, before th' increasing soundOf trampling feet alarm'd me, which I deem'dWere Persia's numbers rushing from the hills:I started upward grasping in my handMy spear and buckler, by my slave withheld,Who told me, they were Thebans. Lo! I bearThe tydings of their flight. And now, my chiefAnd countrymen, farewel. Do you proceed,With death and terrour fill the hostile camp;
While I the fury of th' exulting foeDescending from the mountains here awaitTo yield the last remains of tedious lifeNow to my country useless, and to me,And close these shaded eyes in endless night.HE ceas'd, when thus Leonidas began.Then stay, my faithful soldier, and obtainNot the least honours in this glorious night;And you, my brave associates, all exult;One spirit now inspires us; from our bandDoubt, fear, and treason with the Thebans fly:While all with mutual confidence advance,And equal fires. This said, once more the kingOn the deep phalanx his attentive eyeReverts, and through the ruddy gleam descriesOne face of gladness; but th' illustrious van
He most contemplates: Agis, Alpheus there,Megistias, Maron, and Plataea's chief,Dieneces, Demophilus are drawn,And Dithyrambus. They their fixed sightOn him too bend with inexpressive joy,With love, and veneration, till they hearHis last command; when instant to the earthAre cast th' extinguish'd brands. On all aroundDrops sudden darkness, on the hills, the woods,The silver stream, the rocks, and floating main.It now was midnight. To the hostile campWith steps compos'd and silent down the passThe phalanx moves. Each patient bosom hush'dIts struggling spirit, nor in whispers breath'dThe rapt'rous ardour, virtue then inspir'd;But all await the moment doom'd to give
The Barb'rous millions to their deathful steel:So low'ring clouds expanding from the northA while suspend their horrours, destin'd soonTo blaze in lightnings, and to burst in storms.End of the Eighth Book.LEONIDAS. BOOK IX.The argument.Leonidas and the Grecians penetrate through the Persian camp to the very pavilion of Xerxes, who avoids destruction by flight. The Barbarians are slaughter'd in great multitudes, and their camp is set on fire. Leonidas conducts his men back to Thermopylae, engages the Persians, who were descended from the hills, and after numberless proofs of superiour strength and valour sinks down cover'd with wounds, and expires the last of all the Grecian commanders.THE waining moon display'd her gleaming horns,When o'er th' unguarded bound of Asia's campNow pass'd the Grecians. Through th' unnumber'd tents,Where all was mute and tranquil, they pursue
Their silent march. The eastern world aroundLay stretch'd in slumber, motionless, and deaf,Wrapt in the dead security of night,Nor mark'd the steps of Fate. The wary GreeksBy Polydorus guided still proceed.Ev'n to the center of th' extensive hostUnseen they pierc'd, when now th' imperial tentYet distant rose before them. Wide aroundThe proud pavilion stretch'd an ample space,Where myriads might imbattle. Here a bandOf chosen Persians watchful round their kingHeld their nocturnal station. As the heartsOf anxious nations menac'd with the wasteOf meager famine, and the ruthless swordSink in their frozen bosoms, while despairSees fear-ingender'd fantoms in the sky,Aërial hosts amid the clouds array'd,
Which seem to shake the firmament with war,Portending woe and death; the Persians thusAre smote with consternation, as the moonBy her faint beam discover'd from afarThe glimpse of Grecian arms. With sudden criesThey waken Horrour, which to Xerxes' couch,And o'er th' astonish'd host, swift-winged flewDispelling sleep and silence. All the campPours forth its numbers naked, pale, unarm'd,Wild with amazement, blinded by dismay,To ev'ry foe obnoxious; when at oncePlung'd in ten thousand breasts the Grecian steelReeks with destruction. Deluges of bloodFloat o'er the field, and foam around the heapsOf wretches slain unconscious of the hand,Which mows them down by legions. From his couchThe lord of Asia and of Lbia st
(Amaze, affright, distraction in his look)And sees in thought united Greece advance.Where then was fled the empty pride of kings,The hope of glory, and the lust of pow'r?What then avail'd th' innumerable rangeOf thy huge camp save only to concealThy trembling steps, O Xerxes, while thou fliest.Leonidas before the Grecian vanThrough bleeding thousands hews his dreadful way.Before him Terrour strides. Gigantic Death,And Desolation at his side attend,With all the Furies of insatiate war.To Xerxes' tent the hero speeds, nor findsHis victim. Ardent throngs of Grecians fillThe stately mansion; to the ground are hurl'dThe glitt'ring ensigns of imperial pow'r:The diadem, the scepter, late ador'd
And fear'd by millions, underneath their feetWith mingled rage and scorn the Grecians crush,A sacrifice to Freedom. Now returnThe furious bands. Leonidas exaltsFor new destruction his resistless spear,When sudden night o'ershrouds the spangled heav'ns,And clouds condensing intercept the moon.Black o'er the furrow'd main the raging eastIn whirlwinds sweeps the surge. Now roars the coast,The crashing forests, and the cavern'd rocks.Swift through the camp the hurricane impellsIts dire career, when Asia's numbers, veil'dAmid the shelt'ring horrours of the storm,Evade the Spartan lance. The Grecians halt,By great Leonidas restrain'd, and waitNear Xerxes' tent their mighty leader's will.BESIDE the high pavilion from the time,That Xerxes near Thermopylae had drawnHis num'rous bands, perpetual fire had shone;Before whose sacred light the Persian lordWas wont among his Magi to adoreThe power of Oromasdes: piles of woodLay nigh, prepar'd to feed the constant flame.These on the altar by the Greeks are strewn,So wills Laconia's hero; while the windsExcite the blaze, his phalanx he divides;Four bands are form'd by Dithyrambus led,By Alpheus, by Diomedon, the lastHimself commands. The word is giv'n; the GreeksPress to the fire; soon shrink the burning heaps;Destructive flames they brandish, and, injoin'd
To reassemble at the regal tent,By various paths the hostile camp invade.RESISTLESS desolation now involvesThe Malian fields, as o'er the eastern tentsFrom diff'rent stations flew ten thousand brandsHurl'd by the Greeks unrespited. The windsWith violence redoubled breathing roundTempestuous rage exasperate the blaze.The conflagration, like a sea, expands;Collected now from ev'ry part it formsOne waving surface of unbounded fire.In ruddy volumes mount the curling flamesTo heav'n's dark vault, and paint the midnight clouds.So, when the north emits its purpled lights,The undulating radiance streaming wide,As with a burning canopy, invests
Th' ethereal concave. Oeta now disclos'dIts forehead glitt'ring with eternal frost,While down the rocks the foamy torrents shone.Far o'er the main the pointed rays were thrown;Night snatch'd her mantle from the ocean's breast;The billows glimmer from the distant shores.But where ascends a pillar huge of smokeWith wreathing flames incircled, Horrour thereAnd Death on great Leonidas attend.He bade th' exulting Polydorus lead,Where Asia's horse and chariots stood arrang'd;There at his word devouring Vulcan feastsOn all the tribute, which Thessalia's meadsYield to the scythe, and riots on the heapsOf Ceres emptied of the ripen'd grain.A flood of fire envelopes all the ground;The cordage bursts of ev'ry blazing tent;
Down sink the roofs, and overwhelm the throngOf wretches panting from the Spartan sword,Close-wedg'd with fear; the Libyan chariot burns,Th' Arabian camel, and the Persian steedBound through the fiery deluge; wild with painThey shake their singed manes, with madding hoofsDash through the blood of thousands mix'd with flames,That rage augmented by the whirlwind's blast.MEANTIME the scepter'd lord of half the globeThrough the wide tumult, like a guilty slave,From tent to tent precipitates his flight.Dispers'd are all his satraps; Pride itselfShuns his dejected brow; Despair aloneWith pale Confusion, and with frantic FearWait on th' imperial fugitive, and shew,As round the camp his eye distracted roves,
No limits to destruction. Now was seenAurora mounting from the eastern hillsIn rosy sandals, and with dewy locks:The winds subside before her, darkness flies,And streams of light proclaim the chearful day.When now at Xerxes' tent the Grecian bandWas reunited. What could Fortune moreTo aid the valiant, and to gorge revenge?Lo! Desolation o'er the Persian hostHath emptied all its horrours; ev'n the handOf languid slaughter drops its crimson steel;Nor Nature longer can sustain the toilOf ever-during conquest. Yet what pow'rAmong the Grecians once again reviv'dTheir drooping warmth; new-brac'd their nerves, and call'dTheir wearied swords to deeds of brighter fame?What, but th' inspiring hope of glorious death
To crown their labour, and th' auspicious lookOf their heroic chief, which still unchang'd,Still with superiour majesty declar'dNo toil had yet relax'd his matchless strength,Nor worn the vigour of his godlike soul.Down to the pass with gentle march he leadsTh' imbattled warriors. There behind the shrubs,Which near the verdant feet of Oeta sprung,Beside the entrance of the straits the GreeksIn ambush lay. The tempest now was calm'd;Soft breezes only from the Malian waveO'er each grim face besmear'd with smoke and goreTheir cool refreshment breath'd. The healing galeDispells the languor from their harass'd limbs,Which swell with strength returning. After allTh' incessant labours of the horrid nightThrough flames and war continu'd, they prepare
In order'd battle to confront the pow'rsOf Hyperanthes, that selected bandFrom Asia's numbers, destin'd with the mornTo pass the mountains in triumphant marchWith strength unwasted, and with souls elate.Not long the Greeks in expectation stoodImpatient. Sudden with tumultuous shouts,Like Nile's swift current, where with deafning roarProne from the steep of Elephantis fallsIts sea of waters, Hyperanthes poursHis rapid legions o'er the Grecian campDown from the hills precipitant. No foeIs found to stop the torrent; on they rollWith thund'ring footsteps o'er the sounding pass.THAT night no sooner had the Theban trainThermopylae forsaken, but their course
They bent along the mountains, till they metThe pow'rs of Xerxes. Dusky twilight stillPrevailing, Persia with misguided rageAssail'd her friends unknown. Th'impetuous spearOf Hyperanthes clove the faithless heartOf Anaxander; on, the hero press'd,And spread destruction through their bleeding ranks;Nor check'd his ardent valour, till he heardThe name of Thebes in suppliant cries proclaim'd:The Persians then receive them, in the frontAs guides they place them, and, amaz'd to learn,That daring Greece should Xerxes' camp invade,Haste from the mountains, rush along the pass,And now tumultuous issue from its mouth.At once Laconia's leader gives the sign,When, as th' impulsive ram with dreadful swayO'erturns the nodding rampart from its base,
And strews a town with ruin, so the bandOf serried heroes down the Malian steep,An hideous depth, the blended numbers sweptOf Thebes and Persia. There no waters flow,But horrid rocks present their craggy sides;There dash'd whole legions. From their mangled limbsA tide of blood rolls foaming to the sea.Again thy voice, Leonidas, is heard;The Grecians turn; against the op'ning passThey point their wheeling phalanx; on they rush.Astonish'd Persia stops in full career,Ev'n Hyperanthes starts with terrour back.Confusion drives fresh numbers from the shore,Whelm'd in the Malian slime. Th' undaunted kingOf Lacedaemon enter'd now the straits,And rang'd for battle. Hyperanthes soonRecall'd his chosen warriours from their fear.
Swift on the great Leonidas was bentA grove of darts; th' incount'ring armies clos'd.WHOM first, whom last, great Spartan, didst thou foil?What rivers heard along their echoing banksThy name in curses sounded from the lipsOf mothers wailing for their slaughter'd sons!What towns with empty monuments were fill'dFor those, whom thy unconquerable swordThis day to vultures cast! First Bessus died,A haughty satrap, whose tyrannic handDespoil'd Hyrcania of her golden sheaves,And laid her forests waste. For him the beesAmong the branches interwove their sweets;For him the fig was ripen'd, and the vineWith rich profusion o'er the goblet foam'd.Then Dinis bled. On Hermus' side he reign'd,
And long had sought with unavailing loveGreat Artemisia fam'd in Xerxes' fleet,The martial queen of Caria. She disdain'dThe lover's soft complaint; her dauntless earWas taught to mark the tempest, while it rag'd;Her sight was practic'd from the rolling deckTo brave the chafing billows; doom'd to meetThat day of horrour, when the weeping eyeOf Xerxes saw the blood of nations flow,And to its bottom tinge the briny floodsOf Salamis, whence she with Asia fled,She only not inglorious: low reclinesHer lover now, on Hermus' banks no moreTo sound her name, nor tell the vocal grovesHis fruitless sorrows. Then Madauces fell,A Paphlagonian born amid the soundOf dashing surges, and the roar of winds;
Who o'er th' unhospitable Euxine wavesWas wont from high Carambis' cliff to watchTh' ill-fated bark, which cut the Pontic stream,Then with his dire associates through the deepFor spoil and slaughter guide his hostile prow.With these Tithraustes far from Medus fall'n,His native tide, with blooming strength indu'd,And manly grace, Lilaeus, who had leftThe balmy fragrance of Arabia's fields,And Babylonian Tenagon expir'd.His bravest friends on ev'ry side o'erthrownWith indignation Hyperanthes view'd,And in fierce haste his dauntless arm oppos'd.To Sparta's hero. Each his lance protends,But thousands rush with interposing shields,Such sacred lives all anxious to defend;Or thither Fortune urg'd the tide of war,
Their term protracting for augmented fame.So, when two gallies lab'ring through the foamPresent for battle their destructive beaks,The billows oft, by hurricanes impell'd,With mountainous commotion dash between,And either bark in black'ning tempests veil'dWaft from its distant foe. But fiercer burn'dThy ardour, mighty Spartan, while in bloodThy falchion rag'd unwearied. Now the steedsOf day were climbing their meridian steep,And o'er the Persian camp the shouts of warBurst from Thermopylae. Pharnuchus heard,Who from his couch beyond the Malian plain,Rous'd by the tumult in the neighb'ring tentsTo aid his lord had left Thessalia's fieldsWith Syria, Cholchis, and Armenia's bands,Th' Assyrians, and Chaldaeans. Asia's camp
Was still the seat of terrour and despair.As in some fruitful clime, which late hath knownThe rage of winds and floods, when now the stormIs heard no longer and the deluge fled,Still o'er the wasted region Nature mournsIn melancholy silence, through the groveWith prostrate glories lie the stately oakAnd elm uprooted, while the plains are spreadWith fragments swept from villages o'erthrown,And round the pastures flocks and herds are castIn weltring heaps of death; so Persia's hostIn horrour mute one boundless scene displaysOf desolation: half devour'd by fireIts tall pavilions, and its warlike carsHide all the field with ruin; here in goreIts princes lie, and nameless thousands there,Here legions bleeding by the Grecian steel,
There Persians slain by Persians still declareThe wild confusion of the direful night,When wanting signals, and their leaders careThey rush'd to mutual slaughter. Xerxes' tentOn its exalted summit, when the dawnFirst streaks the glowing sky, was wont to bearThe golden form of Mithra, clos'd betweenTwo lucid crystals, to the Barb'rous hostAn awful signal all in arms to leaveTheir crouded tents, and numberless to waitTheir monarch's presence; this Pharnuchus rearsHigh on the proud pavilion: at the sightTheir consternation is at length dispell'd,And through th' assembling nations hope revives.Pharnuchus then from all the number formsA chosen train; Thermopylae he seeks;Their march in loudest clamours is proclaim'd.
His phalanx soon Leonidas commandsTo circle backward from the Malian shore:Their order changes; now half-orb'd they standBy Oeta's mountains guarded from behindWith either flank united to the rock.As, by th' excelling architect dispos'dTo shield some haven, a stupendous moleFram'd of the grove and quarry's mingled strengthIn ocean's bosom penetrates afar;There stands the pride of art against the weightOf seas, unmov'd, and breaks the whelming surge:So, when Pharnuchus with innum'rous pow'rsThermopylae had fill'd, th' unyielding GreeksOppos'd the hostile deluge, and its rage,Unshaken stem'd. Amid the foremost rankLeonidas his dreadful station held.Before him soon an horrid void is seen
Through Persia's legions, and the proud remainsOf noblest chiefs th' insanguin'd rock bestrew.Pharnuchus glowing with revenge and wrathDischarges full at Lacedaemon's chiefHis iron-studded mace. Aside it glanc'd,Turn'd by the massy shield, and prone to earthThe Persian fell. Alcander to the rockTransfix'd the prostrate satrap through the reins,Himself receiving in th' unguarded sideThe lance of Hyperanthes. Low he lies,The only Theban, who by Sparta's kingAbode intrepid, and to Greece preserv'dHis faith untainted; a physician sage,Who from Cithaeron each benignant herbWas wont to gather, and expatiate o'erThe Heliconian pastures, where no plantOf poison springs, but such, whose healing juice
Expells the venom from the viper's toothFill'd with the sweetness of the soil divine:Him all, who languish on the bed of pain,Him most, the wretch, whom want, and sickness spreadsOn earth's cold breast neglected, shall deplore.On him the brave Artontes sinks in death,Renown'd through wide Bithynia now no moreThe clam'rous rites of Cybele to share,While Echo murmurs through the hollow cavesOf Berecynthian Dindymus. The handOf Alpheus sent him to the shades of night.E'er from the dead he disingag'd his spear,Huge Abradates glorying in his strength,Surpassing all of Cissian race, advanc'dTo grapple with the victor; near him nowHis foremost step the Persian plants, his handGrasps at the Spartan's shoulder. Alpheus once
At Nemea's games the wrestlers crown obtain'd.His art he summons, and his rapid footObliquely strikes against the Persian's heel;He falling seiz'd on Alpheus' neck, and drag'dHis foe upon him. Streight an hundred dartsOf thronging Persia cleave the Grecian's back.To Abradates' breast the weapons pierce,And rivet both in death. This Maron saw,And Polydorus, who with victims fall'nBefore their vengeance hide their brother's corse.At length the gen'rous blood of Maron warmsThe lance of Hyperanthes. On the spearOf Polydorus falls the pond'rous axOf Sacian Mardus; from the yielding woodThe steely point is sever'd. Undismay'dThe Spartan stoops to rear the knotted maceOf slain Pharnuchus; but thy fatal sword,
Abrocomes, that dreadful instant marksTo rend his op'ning side: unconquer'd still,Swift he discharges on the Sacian's frontAn horrid wound, that reach'd the bursting brain.Down his own limbs the while a torrent flowsOf vital crimson; smiling he surveysHis sorrows ending, and his Spartan nameRenew its lustre. Sudden to his sideSprings Dithyrambus; through th' uplifted armOf Mindus pointing his impetuous dartAgainst the bleeding Spartan he impellsHis steel resistless. Polydorus nowStretch'd his cold hand to Thespia's friendly chief,Then bow'd his head in everlasting peace;And Mindus wasted by his flowing woundBeside him faints and dies. In Ninus oldHad his exalted ancestors sustain'd
Th' Assyrian scepter. Now to Persia's throneA tributary lord he rul'd the vales,Where Tigris swift between the parted hillsOf tall Niphátes draws its foaming tide,Impregnating the glebe. At once a croudOf ardent Persians seize the conqu'ror's lance:An hundred arms infold it. Thespia's youthWith one strong hand maintains the struggling spear,The other bares his falchion. Through his foesWith lightning wing'd it scatters wounds and death.Artáphrenes in torture feels his armLopt from the shoulder. Zatis leaves his handYet twining round the long-disputed lance.On Pheron's neck descends the pond'rous blade;Down drops the sever'd head; the vital streamSpouts from its purple sluices. Mardon stridesAcross the pointed ash. His weight o'ercomes
The wearied Grecian, who resigns his hold,Yet cleaves th' exulting Persian to the brain.But now the fierce Abrócomes approach'd,And louring shakes his dart. The wary GreekWith his broad buckler intercepts the stroke,And closes with the Persian. Then what aidOf mortal force, or interposing heav'nPreserv'd the eastern warrior? Lo! the friendOf Teribazus eager to avengeHis lov'd companion, and at once to guardA brother's life, beneath the sinewy armThat instant rais'd for slaughter plung'd his lanceIn Dithyrambus' side. The vital stringsAt once relax; nor Fame, nor Greece demandMore from his valour, and supine he liesIn glories ripen'd on his blooming head.Him shall the Thespian virgins in their songs
Record one loveliest of the youthful train,The good, the gentle, generous, and brave;Now fall'n his country's grace, and parent's pride:So sinks the cedar, which in verdant bloomHigh on the top of Libanus had stoodThe mountain's boast, and glory of the grove;Then to adorn the mansions of the great,Or dignify some God's high-vaulted faneUprooted low'rs its heav'n-aspiring head.Diomedon bursts forward. Round his friendHe heaps destruction. What a troop of ghostsAttend thy shade, fall'n hero! Long unmatch'dPrevail'd his vengeful arm, and Persia bled;Till four Assyrians on his shelving lance,E'er yet extracted from a prostrate corse,Their pond'rous maces all discharge. It broke.Yet with the truncheon of his shatter'd spear
The Greek sustains the contest. Through his eyeThe shiver'd fragment penetrates the brainOf one bold warriour; there the splintry woodInfix'd remains: the hero then unsheathsHis falchion broad; a second views aghastHis entrails falling, while Plataea's chiefFrom the gash'd belly draws his reeking sword:Prone sinks a third beneath the falchion's weight;Though with the furious stroke the yielding bladeFlew from the hilt, and left the Greek disarm'd:The fourth that instant lifts his knotted mace;It falls resistless on the batter'd helm,And low the great Diomedon extendsHis mighty limbs. So weaken'd by the forceOf some tremendous engine, which the handOf Mars impells, a stately turret spreadsIts disuniting ramparts on the plain;
Joy fills th' assailants, while the battle's tideWhelms o'er the widening breach. The Persians thusO'er the late-fear'd Diomedon had rush'd,And swept the Greeks before them; when beholdLeonidas! At once their ardour froze.He had a while within the orb retir'd,Oppress'd by labour. Now with strength restor'dHe pours fresh ruin from the Spartan front.As, long retarded by th' unmoving calm,Soon, as a rising gale fresh-breathing curlsThe surging main, again the vessel boundsWith all her op'ning sails; the hero thusHis buckler huge, and formidable spearAdvancing, through the Asian files renewsHis course of slaughter. Destiny compellsThe bold Hydarnes to th' unequal fight,Who proudly vaunting left his weeping bride
To mourn his absence on the distant vergeOf Bactrian Ochus. Victory in vainHe parting promis'd. Wanton hope no moreRound his cold heart delusive sports, nor paintsTh' imagin'd pomp of triumphs, gorgeous spoils,And trains of shackled Greeks. The Spartan pierc'dHis shield, and bursting corselet. From the slainThe victor draws his iron-pointed spearBent, and infeebled with the forceful blow.Meantime within his buckler's verge, unseenAmphistreus stealing in th' unguarded flankHis poniard struck. With swift effusion gush'dA crimson torrent, but the scaly mailImmediate death repell'd. Th' indignant kingGripes with resistless might the Persian's throat,And drags him prostrate. None in Xerxes' courtWas more corrupt, with insolence more base,
With rancour more fallacious. Phrygia pin'dBeneath th' oppression of his ruthless sway.Was there a field once fruitful, or a townOnce populous and rich? The horrid changeTo want and desolation there declar'd,The curs'd Amphistreus govern'd. As the spearOf Tyrian Cadmus riveted to earthThe pois'nous dragon, whose infectious breathHad blasted half Boeotia; so the chiefOf Lacedaemon trampling on the neckOf fall'n Amphistreus fixes to the rockThe gasping tyrant, and his broken lanceLeaves in the panting corse. Meanwhile thy woundIncessant flows, great hero, and augmentsThe hopes of Persia. Thou unyielding stillSustain'st the contest, while unnumber'd dartsAre shiver'd on thy buckler, and thy feet
With glitt'ring points bestrew; the Cholchian sword,And Persian dagger leave their shatter'd hilts;Bent is the Caspian scymetar; in vainThe Sacian wheels his falchion, and their maceThe strong Chaldaeans and Assyrians raise:Thou stand'st unshaken, like a Thracian hill,Like Rhodopé, or Haemus; where in vainThe thund'rer plants his livid bolt, in vainThe glancing lightning cleaves th' incrusted snow,And Winter beating with eternal warShakes from his dreery wings discordant storms,Chill sleet, and clatt'ring hail. But now advanc'dAbrocomes, and aim'd his deadly spearAgainst the forehead of Laconia's chief,Not unperceiv'd; the Spartan's active handHis sword opposing upward rears the bladeAgainst the threatning javelin; o'er his crest
Its fury wastes in air, while swift descendsThe pond'rous falchion on the Persian's knee:At once the bone is sever'd; prone he falls;Crush'd on the ground beneath ten thousand feetThe gallant warriour breaths the last remainsOf tortur'd life. The Spartan thus maintain'dTh' unequal combat with his single sword.But Agis calls Diéneces, alarmsDemophilus, Megistias; they from heapsOf Allarodian and Sasperian slainHaste to their leader, and before him raiseThe brazen bulwark of their massy shields.The foremost line of Asia stands and bleeds;The rest recoil: but Hyperanthes stridesFrom rank to rank throughout his various host,Their dying hopes rekindles, in the braveExcites new valour, and the freezing heart
Of Fear revives. Astaspes first obey'dThe hero's voice, a fierce Chaldaean lordVain of his birth from antient Belus drawn,Proud of his wealthy stores, and stately domes;But now more proud by conquest, since his mightHad foil'd the strong Diomedon. He seeksThe front of battle. His victorious maceAgainst the brave Diéneces he bends;The weighty blow bore down th' opposing shield,And crush'd the Spartan's shoulder: idle hangsThe buckler now, and loads th' inactive armDepriv'd of all its functions. Agis baresHis vengeful blade, and severs from the foeHis hand exalted for a second stroke.The dying fingers with convulsive graspThe falling mace infold. A Sacian chiefSprings on the victor. Iäxartes' banks
To this brave savage gave his name and birth.His looks erect, and fierce deportment spokeA bold and gallant spirit, but untam'd,With dreery wilds familiar, and a raceOf rude Barbarians horrid as their clime.The hostile spear, against his forehead aim'd,Glanc'd upward, and o'erturn'd his iron cone:The blow renew'd his bursting chest divides.Th' undaunted Sacian writhes along the lance,Which griding passes through his breast and back,A barbed arrow from his quiver draws,Deep in the streaming pap of Agis hidesThe deadly steel, then grimly smiles and dies.From him Fate hastens to a nobler prey;For lo! the brave Diéneces presentsHis breast obnoxious to a thousand darts.The shield deserts his unsustaining arm,
And slides to earth. A grove of javelins roseOn his broad bosom. Still for ev'ry woundHe hurl'd a Persian to th'infernal gloom;But life at length forfook his riven heart,And o'er the rock the gasping hero stretch'dHis dying limbs in gore. Who now can standThe torrent of Barbarians? Agis bleeds,His spear is irrecoverably plung'dIn Iäxartes' body. Low reclinesDiéneces in gore. The Spartan chiefHimself o'erlabour'd, of his lance disarm'dThe rage of Death can exercise no more.One last and glorious effort age performs.Demophilus, Megistias join their might,And stem the floods of conquest; while the spearOf slain Diéneces to Sparta's kingThe fainting Agis bore. The blazing steel
In that dire hand again for battle rear'dBlasts all the Persian valour. Back in heapsThey roll confounded, by their leader's voiceIn vain exhorted longer to endureThe ceaseless waste of that unconquer'd arm.So, when the giants from Olympus chas'dTh' inferiour Gods, themselves in terrour shun'dTh' incessant streams of lightning, when the handOf heav'n's great father with eternal mightSustain'd the direful conflict. O'er the fieldAwhile Bellona stills the rage of war;When Thespia's leader, and Megistias dropAt either side of Lacedaemon's king.Beneath the weight of years and labour bendThe hoary warriours. Not a groan molestsTheir parting spirits, but in death's calm night,All-silent, bows each venerable head:
Like aged oaks, whose deep-descending rootsHad pierc'd resistless through the mountain's side,And there for three long centuries had brav'dEach angry gust of Eurus, and the North;Till, sapless now by Time's despoiling hand,Without a blast their mossy trunks reclineBefore their parent hill. By Sparta's chiefNone now remains but Agis, who imploresThe last kind office from his godlike friend,The Sacian's arrow from his pap to draw.This done, life issues with the sanguine tide.Thy comely features, Agis, now are pale;Cold are thy graceful limbs, and dim thy eyes,Which now no more with placid beams revealThe native virtues of thy gentle breast.The noble corse Leonidas surveys.Fate yields him one short interval of peace
To know how lovely are the patriot's wounds,And see those honours grace the man, he lov'd.But Hyperanthes with his single spearForth from the trembling ranks of Asia tow'rsHis country's glory to redeem, or fall.The Spartan worn by toil his languid armOnce more uplifting waits the dauntless prince.The heroes now stood adverse. Each a whileRestrain'd his valour, and his godlike foeAdmiring view'd. Such majesty and strengthTo fierce Pelides all incircled roundWith Trojan dead; and such to Priam's sonBy struggling virtue, and by manly shameFrom flight recall'd, great Homer's fancy gave.O thou exalted o'er the laurel'd trainHigh, as the sweet Calliope is thron'dAbove each vigin of the tuneful hill;
Now let one beam of thy celestial lightDart through my lab'ring mind; lest Freedom mournHer chosen son dishonour'd in these strains!NOW Hyperanthes, and Laconia's kingWith brandish'd points, and targets high uprear'dCommence the fatal combat, which must closeThe long-continu'd horrours of the day.Fix'd with amaze and fear, the Asian filesUnmov'd and silent on their bucklers pause.Thus o'er th' expanse of India's wilds contendThe elephant, and horn'd rhinoceros;Earth groans beneath them, as with wrath untam'dEach hideous bulk in dire encounter meets:With distant terrour gaze the savage throng.Prolong'd by varied art, the dubious fightThe great event suspended. On the foe
His well-aim'd spear at last the Spartan drove,And pierc'd the shield. Inexorable fateThat moment hover'd o'er the eastern prince,When with unmatch'd celerity asideHe swung his buckler; underneath his arm,Unstain'd with blood the hostile javelin pass'd:Meantime, with joy, and ardent hopes elateOf fame and conquest, sudden he impell'dHis rapid lance against the Spartan's throat;But he with wary skill his target rais'd,And o'er his shoulder turn'd the glancing steel;For one last effort then his scatter'd strengthRecall'd, and wheeling with resistless forceHis massy buckler dash'd the brazen vergeAgainst the Persian's forehead: down he sunkWithout a groan expiring, as o'erwhelm'd
Beneath a marble fragment from its seatHeav'd by a whirlwind sweeping o'er the ridgeOf some aspiring mansion. Gen'rous prince!What could his valour more? His single mightHe match'd with great Leonidas, and fellBefore his native bands. The Spartan chiefNow stands alone. In heaps his slaughter'd friendsAll stretch'd around him lie. The distant foesShow'r on his head innumerable darts.From various sluices gush the vital floods,And stain his fainting limbs. Nor yet with painHis brow is clouded, but those beauteous wounds,The sacred pledges of his own renown,And Sparta's safety, with serenest joyHis closing eye contemplates. Fame can twineNo brighter laurels round his glorious head,
His virtue more to labour Fate forbids,And lays him now in honourable restTo seal his country's liberty in death.End of the Ninth and Last Book.ERRATA.B.2.l.130.for sult'ry r. sultry.   160.for breasts r. hearts. 3. 311.332. 407. for poynard 4. poniard.   553.for, put.   606.after Greece put:   611.dele the full point 4. 177.for Pencestes r.
