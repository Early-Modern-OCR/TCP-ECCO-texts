Address to a Locket.The Words from Emma Corbet.COME, thou soft and sacred favour,The remembrance chaste impart;Take thy station on my bosom,Lightly lodging near the heart.While that tender heart shall flutter,Thou the secret cause shalt share;Whether pleasure or disaster,Thou shalt see what stirs it there.When the hopes of happy tidingsShall the sweet sensations move,When the white and winged agentsWhisper friendship, whisper love;Then, all sympathetic thrilling,Thou the rosy form shalt guide;While, as runs the iddy treasure,Thou'rt the genius of the tide.Happy, when this heart is sinking,Thou shalt sooth the rising sigh;When with woe surcharg'd, 'tis heaving,Thou shalt see the reason why.Come, thou dear and decent favour,Learn what thou wilt ne'er impart;Fix thy throne, and fix it everIn the regions of my heart.FOWLER, PRINTER, SALISBURY.
