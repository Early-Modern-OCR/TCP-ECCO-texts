THE DESERT ISLAND, A DRAMATIC POEM, IN THREE ACTS.As it is Acted at the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane.Te, dulcis conjux, te solo in littore secumTe veniente die, te decedente canebat.VIRG.LONDON, Printed for PAUL VAILLANT, facing Southampton-street, in the Strand. MDCCLX.[Price One Shilling and Six Pence.]ADVERTISEMENT.THE following Piece is founded on the Isola Disabitata of the celebrated ABBE METASTASIO: In reading the Perform∣ance of that great Genius, the present Writer received so exquisite a Pleasure, that he contracted a Passion for the Subject, and could not refrain from exercising his Pen upon it. In the Prose∣cution of his Plan, he knew enough of the mo∣dern Theatre, to perceive that it was thin of what our Play-followers call Business; and he was aware that on the Stage it might prove (to use Milton's Words) very different from what among us passes for Best. The same Remark was made by a Friend of the Author's, who thought it hazardous to offer to a popular Assembly a Piece, in which there were none of those Strokes that generally succeed with the Multitude. "Can't you," said he, throw in something here and there to season it more to the public Appetite?—Suppose you were to change the Title, and fix the Scene among the Anthropophagi, or among the Men, whose Heads do grow beneath their Shoulders—a few of those extraordinary Personages exhibited on the Stage, will prove very acceptable:—What think you of an Irish Servant in it?—That certainly will insure Success, the more especially if you add some aerial Beings, and conclude the Whole with a drunken Song by the Tars of Old Eng∣land.—The Author was sensible of the Force of these Observations; but the GREAT MILTON (mentioned above) stared him in the Face, with his Reflections on the Error of introducing tri∣vial and vulgar Persons, which, by all Judicious, hath been counted absurd, and brought in with∣out Discretion, CORRUPTLY to gratify the Peo∣ple.Vide, Preface to Samson Agonistes.—He therefore determined to preserve the

Integrity of his original Design, and to try what would be the Effect of a simple Fable, with, but few Incidents, supported entirely by the Spirit of Poetry, Sentiment, and Passion. To combine these there Qualities is indeed an arduous Task; and the Author, therefore, does not flatter himself that he has entirely succeeded in so difficult an Attempt.In Justice to METASTASIO, he thinks proper to inform the mere English Reader, that he hath not been a Translator on this Occasion, but has fol∣lowed the Impulse of his own Imagination, ex∣cepting in a few Passages. The ITALIAN POET gave the Fable; the present Writer made his own Use of it; or in other Words, the Ground-work, or Canevas, (as the French call it) is METASTASIO'S; for the Colouring Mr. Murphy is answerable.He could not but be surprized to find that, on the first Night, the Scene in the third Act, between Sylvia and Henrico, was deemed equivocal. There is always a sufficient Number ready to ascribe to an Author various Meanings, which he never had, "and see at Cannon's what was never there."—To these Gentlemen he returns his Thanks; but the Species of Wit, which they are willing to allow him, he begs leave publickly to disclaim. The Cha∣racter of a Girl, who has never seen a Man, and who has been taught to think of such a Being with Horror, is merely imaginary; but the possible, or Poetical Existence of such a Girl being once esta∣blished, it is to be wished that the Critics would agree what Questions it is natural for her to ask on her first Interview with a Man, METASTASIO makes her say,Che vuoi da me?Un Uom Sei dunque!Andiamo Insieme.Ah! troppo ron trattenerli, &c.And these little Touches, (so differently do we judge in England) were thought abroad to be deli∣cate Strokes of the most elegant Simplicity.He could wish it had been universally under∣stood that it was not a TRAGEDY he offered to the Public, but a DRAMATIC POEM; that is to say, a Piece with some interesting Situations to engage the Affections, but which affords more Room for a Picturesque Imagination to display itself, than is generally allowed to the more important Concerns of real Tragedy, where the Distress should be al∣ways encreasing, where the Passions should be al∣ways rising to fuller and stronger Emotions, and where of Course the Poet ought not to find Lei∣sure for Imagery and Description. Had this been felt and acknowledged, no Body would have looked for another Kind of Entertainment than was pro∣mised, and the Smiles arising from SYLVIA'S Dread of a Man (on the first Discovery of him), and her gradual Attachment to him in Compliance with natural Instinct, would never have been judged inconsistent with the Colour of the Whole. But if the Author of the Desert Island has erred in this, he has the Consolation of having erred with the greatest Poet now in Europe.As many of the malevolent Writers of the Age have heretofore honoured the Author with their Abuse, and as he was apprehensive that they still remained under the Oppression of their Dullness and Obscurity, it was deemed proper to call them forth into Daylight, by exhibiting one general Representative of them all on the Stage. For this he returns his Thanks to the Author of the Prologue; and if any needy Booksellers, or un∣happy Authors, can find their Account in taking further Liberties with him, he hereby declares, he should be sorry not to have Merit enough to pro∣voke some of them, and for their Encouragement,

he adds in the Words of the noble Author of the Characteristics, that He will never reply, un∣less he should hear of them or their Works in any good Company a Twelve-month after.Lincoln's Inn, Jan. 26, 1760.The AUTHOR.PROLOGUE, Written and Spoken by Mr. GARRICK, In the Character of a DRUNKEN POET.ALL, all shall out—all that I know and feel;I will by Heav'n—to higher Powers appeal!—Behold a Bard!—no Author of to-night—No, no,—they can't say that, with all their spite:Ay, you may frown (looking behind the scenes) I'm at you, great and small—Your Poet, Players, Managers and all!—These Fools within here, swear that I'm in liquor—My passion warms me—makes my utt'rance thicker;—I totter too—but that's the Gout and Pain,—French Wines, and living high, have been my bane.—From all temptations now, I wisely steer me;Nor will I suffer one fine Woman near me.And this I sacrifice, to give you pleasure—For you I've coin'd my brains,—and here's the treasure!Pulls out a Manuscript.A treasure this, of profit and delight!And all thrown by for this damn'd stuff to-night:—This is a play would water ev'ry eye!—If I but look upon't, it makes me cry:This Play would tears from blood-stain'd Soldiers draw,—And melt the bowels of hard-hearted Law!Would fore end aft the storm-proof Sailor rake;—Keep turtle-eating Aldermen awake!Would the cold blood of ancient Maidens thrill,And make ev'n pretty younger tongues lie still.This Play not ev'n Managers would refuse,—Had Heav'n but giv'n 'em any brains, to chuse!—Puts up his Manuscript.Your Bard to-night, bred in the ancient school,Designs and measures all by critic rule;'Mongst Friends—it goes no farther—He's a Fool.So very classic, and so very dull—His Desert Island is his own dear Skull:No Soul to make the Play-house ring, and rattle,No Trumpets, Thunder, Ranting, Storms, or Battle!But all your fine poetic Prittle-prattle.The Plot is this—A Lady's cast away—"Long before the beginning of the Play;"And they are taken by a Fisherman,The Lady and the Child—'tis Bays's plan—So on he blunders—He's an Irishman.—'Tis all alike—his comic stuff I mean—I hate all humour—it gives me the Spleen;So damn 'em both, with all my heart, unsight, unseen.But should you ruin him, still I'm undone—I've try'd all ways to bring my Phoenix on—Shewing his Play again.Flatter I can with any of our Tribe—Can cut and slash—indeed I cannot bribe;What must I do then?—beg you to subscribe.Be kind ye Boxes, Galleries, and Pit—'Tis but a Crown a piece, for-all this Wit:All Sterling Wit—to puff myself I hate—You'll ne'er supply your wants at such a rate!'Tis worth your money, I would scorn to wrong ye,—You smile consent—I'll send my hat among ye.Going, he returns.So much beyond all praise your bounties swell!Not my own Tongue, my Gra-ti-tude can tell—"A little Flattery sometimes does well."Staggers off.Dramatis Personae.MEN.FERDINAND, Husband to Constantia, Mr. HOLLAND.HENRICO, Friend to Ferdinand, Mr. FLEETWOOD.WOMEN.CONSTANTIA, Mrs. PRITCHARD.SYLVIA, her Daughter, Miss PRITCHARD.SCENE, A DESERT ISLAND.THE DESERT ISLAND.ACT I.The scene represents a vale in the Desert Island, surrounded by rocks, caverns, grottos, flowering shrubs, exotic trees, and plants growing wild. On one side is a cavern in a rock, over the entrance of which appears, in large characters, an unfinish∣ed inscription. CONSTANTIA is discovered at work at the inscription, in a romantic habit of skins, leaves, and flowers; in her hand she holds a broken sword, and stands in act to finish the imperfect inscription.After a short pause, she begins.REST, rest my arm — ye weary sinews, rest —Awhile forget your office —On this rockHere sit thee down, and think thy-self to stone.Sits down.—Would heav'n I could! — [rises.] Ye shrubs, ye nameless plants,That wildly-gadding 'midst the rifted rocksWreathe your fantastic shoots;—ye darksome treesThat weave yon verdant arch above my head,Shad'wing this solemn scene; — ye moss-grown caves,Romantic grottos,—all ye objects drear, —Tell me, in pity tell me, have ye seen,Thro' the long series of revolving time,In which you have inclos'd this lonely mansion,Say, have ye seen another wretch like me?—No, never!—You, in tend'rest sympathy,Have join'd my plaints— you, at the midnight hour,When with uprooted hair I've strew'd the earth,And call'd my husband gone;—have call'd in vainPerfidious Ferdinand!—you, at that hour,Have waken'd echo in each vocal cell,Till ev'ry grove, and ev'ry mountain hoar,Mourn'd to my griefs responsive—Well you knowThe story of my woes—Ev'n yonder marbleRelenting feels the touch; receives each traceThat forms the melancholy tale.—Tho' rude,And inexpert my hand; — tho' all uncouthThe instrument, — yet there behold my workWell nigh complete—let me about it streight.She advances toward the rock.Ye deep engraven letters, there remain;And if in future time resistless fateShould throw some Briton on this dismal shore;Then speak aloud; — to his astonish'd senseRelate my sad, my memorable case —Alarm his soul, call out —STOP TRAVELLER. HERE CONSTANTIA, WITH HER LITTLE INFANT, SYLVIA, WAS DESERTED BY HER HUSBAND, THE PERFIDIOUS FERDINAND; WHO PRETENDING TO LAND HER FOR REFRESHMENT FROM THE DANGERS OF A STORMY SEA, BARBAROUSLY LEFT HER ON THIS UNHOSPITABLE ISLAND, WHERE SHE ENDED HER DEPLORABLE LIFE. FRIEND! WHOE'ER THOU ART, PITY MY WRONGS, BUT AGAINST MY HUSBAND, (FOR LOVE LIKE MINE CANNOT FORGET WHERE ONCE WITH DELIGHT IT FIXED) I CHARGE YOU NEVER MEDITATE R—Revenge! —the word Revenge is wanting still.Ye holy pow'rs! if with one pitying lookYou'll deign to view me, grant my earnest pray'r!Let me but finish this my sad inscription,Then let this busy, this afflicted heartBe still at once, and beat my breast no more,She goes on with her work.Enter SYLVIA.SYLVIA.My dearest mother — oh! quite out of breath.CONSTANTIA.What is the matter, child?SYLVIA.Why, ma'am, my heart,Beats wild with joy —oh! such an incident!—CONSTANTIA.What incident, my sweet?SYLVIA.My little fawn,My dear, my loveliest fawn, — for many daysWhose loss I've mourn'd; for whose dear sake I've leftNo corner of the isle unsearch'd; —this momentO'er the dew-spangled lawn, with printless feet,Came bounding to me; playful frisk'd aboutWith inexpressive airs of glad surprize,With eager signs of transport—Big round tearsStood trembling in his eye, and seem'd to speakHis fond regret still mingling with his joy.CONSTANTIA.And is it that, my love, delights thee so? —SYLVIA.And can you wonder, ma'am? — yes, that de∣lights me,Transports me, charms me; — he's my darling care,My dear companion, my sweet little friend,That loves me, gambols round me, watches stillWith anxious tenderness my ev'ry motion,Pants on my bosom, leaps into my arms,And wanders o'er me with a thousand kisses.Before this time, he never once stray'd from me;—I thought I lost him; —but he's found again!And can you wonder I'm transported thus!CONSTANTIA.Oh! happy state of innocence! — how sweetThy joys, simplicity, e'er yet the mindWith artificial passions learns to glow;Ere taste has ta'en our senses to her school,Has given each well-bred appetite her laws,Taught us to feel imaginary bliss,Or elss expire in elegance of pain.SYLVIA.Nay, now, again, you're growing grave—'tis youGive laws to appetite; — forbid each senseTo minister delight; your eyes are dimm'dWith constant tears; — the roses on your cheekFade like yon violets, when excessive dewsHave bent their drooping melancholy heads;Soon they repair their graces; soon recalTheir aromatic lives, and smiling yieldTo sighing Zephyr all their balmy sweets.To grief you're still a prey; still wan despairSits with'ring at your heart, and ev'ry featureHas your directions to be fix'd in woe.Nay, pr'ythee now clear up—you make me sad—— Will you, Mama, forget your cares? —CONSTANTIA.Forget! —Oh! sweet oblivion, thy all-healing balmTo wretches you refuse! —can I forgetPerfidious Ferdinand? — His tyrant formIs ever present — The deluding looks,Endearing accents, and the soft regardsWith which he led me to yon moss-clad cave,There to repose awhile —oh! cruel man!And you, ye conscious wilds, I call you false!Accomplices in guilt! — The Zephyrs blandThat pant upon each leaf; — the melodyThat warbles thro' your groves; the falling foun∣tainsThat at each deep'ning cadence lull the mind,Were all suborn'd against me; all conspir'dTo wrap me in the silken folds of sleep.Sudden I wake — where, where is Ferdinand?I rave, I shriek, —no Ferdinand replies;—Frantic I rove thro' all your winding glades,—I seek the shore; — no Ferdinand appears —I climb yon craggy steeps; I see the shipUnfurling all her sails — I call aloud,I stamp, cry out; — deaf as the roaring seaHe catches ev'ry gale that blows from heav'n,And cleaves his liquid way. —SYLVIA.Why will you thusRecal your past afflictions? —CONSTANTIA.Ah! what then,Thou wretched Constance, what were then thy feelingsI rend my tresses, — beat my breast in vain,In vain stretch out these ineffectual arms,Pierce with my frantic cries the wounded air,Dash my bare bosom on the flinty rock,Then rise again, and strain my aching sight,To see the ship still less'ning to my view,And take the last, last glimpse, as far, far offIn the horizon's verge she dwindles still,Grows a dim speck, and mixes with the cloudsJust vanishing, — just lost, —ah! seen no more.SYLVIA.I pr'ythee don't talk so—my heart dies in me—Why won't you strive a little to forgetThis melancholy theme? — the twilight greyOf morn but faintly streaks the east; the starsStill glimmer thro' the whit'ning air; the grovesAre mute; yon all-devouring deep lies hush'd;The tuneful birds, and the whole brute creationStill sink in soft oblivious slumber wrapp'd,Forgetful of their cares;—all, —all but youKnow some repose; — you pass the dreary nightIn tears and ceaseless grief; then rising wildAnticipate the dawn, and here resumeYour doleful task, or else ascend the heightOf yonder promontory; there forlornYou sit, and hear the brawling waves beneathLash the resounding shore; your brimful eyeStill fix'd on that sad quarter of the heav'nsWhere my hard father disappear'd.CONSTANTIA.Yes, thereMy melancholy loves to dwell; there lovesTo sit, and pine over its hoard of grief;To roll these eyes o'er all the sullen main,In hopes some sail may this way shape its course,With tidings of the human race—Oh! heav'ns!Could I behold that dear, that wish'd for sight,Could I but see some vestiges of man,Some mark of social life, ev'n tho' the shipShould shun this isle, and court propitious galesBeneath some happier clime; yet still the viewWould chear my soul, and my heart bound with joyAt that faint prospect of my fellow creatures.But not for me, such transport;—not for me—Dear native land, I now no more must see thee,Condemn'd in ever-during solitude to mourn,From thy sweet joys, society, debarr'd!SYLVIA.But to your happiness what's wanting here?Full many a time I've heard you praise the arts,The polish'd manners, and gay scenes of blissWhich Europe yields — yet ever and anonI from your own discourse can gather tooThat happiness is all unknown to Europe;That envy there can dwell, and discontent;The smile, that wakens at another's woe;The heart, that sickens at another's praise;The tongue, that carries the malignant tale;The little spirit, that subverts a friend;Fraud, perfidy, ingratitude, and murder.Now sure with reason I prefer these scenesOf innocence, tranquillity, and joy!CONSTANTIA.Alas! my child, 'tis easy to foregoUnknown delights — pleasures we've never felt. —SYLVIA.Are we not here what you yourself have told meIn Europe sovereigns are? — here we have fix'dOur little sylvan reign. — The guileless raceOf animals, that roam the lawns and woods,Are tractable and willing subjects; — payPassive obedience to us — and yon seaBecomes our tributary; hither rollsIn each hoarse-murm'ring tide his various storesOf daintiest shell-fish — the unbidden earth,Of human toil all ignorant, pours forthWhatever to the eye, or taste, can proveRare, exquisite, and good — at once the springCalls forth its green delights, and summer's blushGlows on each purple branch. The seasons hereOn the same tree, with glad surprize,Behold each other's gifts arise;Spontaneous fruits around us grow;For ever here the Zephyrs blow:Shrubs ever flow'ring,Shades embow'ring;Heav'nly spots,Cooling grots,Verdant mountains,Falling fountains;Pure limpid rills,Adown the hills,That wind their wayAnd o'er the meadows play,Enamour'd of th' enchanted ground.CONSTANTIA.What is this waste of beauty, all these charmsOf cold, inanimate, unconscious nature,Without the social sense? those joys, my Sylvia,Thou can'st not miss; for thou hast never known 'em.SYLVIA.But still, those beauteous tracts of Europe,Which you so much regret, are full of men;And men, you know, are animals of prey:I'm sure that you yourself have told me soA thousand times. —CONSTANTIA.And if I have, my child,I told a dismal truth. — Oh! they are false,Inexorable, cruel, fell deceivers;Their unrelenting hearts no harbour knowFor honour, truth, humanity, or love.SYLVIA.Well then, in this lone isle, this dear retreatFrom them at least we're free. —CONSTANTIA.Poor innocent!I can't but grieve for her —Bursts into tears, aside.SYLVIA.Why fall afreshThose drops of sorrow? — pray you, now give o'er. —CONSTANTIA.My heart will break—I do not grieve, my child—I can't conceal my tears—they must have way—SYLVIA.Nay, if you love me, sure you will not thusMake my heart ake within me! —CONSTANTIA.No, my sweet —I will not weep — all will be well, my love —Oh! misery! — I can't, — I can't contain —The black ingratitude! —Weeps.SYLVIA.Say, is there aughtThat I can do, Mama, to give you comfort? —If there is, tell me — shall I fetch my fawn?Dry up your tears, and he is your's this moment,—I'll run and bring him to you. —CONSTANTIA.Sylvia, no! —SYLVIA.Nay do, Mama—I beg you will—you shall.Exit.CONSTANTIAalone.Alas! I fear my brain will turn — the sunFull sixteen times hath made his annual course,Since here I've dragg'd a miserable being,The victim of despair; which long e'er now,To phrenzy kindling, must have forc'd me dashMy brain in madness on yon flinty rocks,And end my pangs at once; if the keen instinctOf strong maternal love had not restrain'dMy wild disorder'd soul, and bade me liveTo watch her tender infancy; to rearHer blooming years; with fond delighted careTo tend each blossom of her growing mind,And see light gradual dawning on her soul.And yet to see her thus, — to see her here,Cut off from ev'ry social bliss; condemn'dLike some fair flow'r that in a desert grows,To breathe its sweets into the passing wind,And waste its bloom all unperceiv'd away!It is enough to break a mother's heart.Let me not think on't—let me shun that thought.Sits down and sings.I.What tho' his guilt my heart hath torn,Yet lovely is his mien,His eyes mild-op'ning as the morn,Round him each grace is seen.But oh! ye nymphs, your loves ne'er let him win,For oh! deceit and falshood dwell within.II.From his red lip his accents stole,Soft as kind vernal snows;Melting they came, and in the soulDesire and joy arose.But oh! ye nymphs, ne'er listen to his art,For oh! base falshood rankles in his heart.III.He left me in this lonely state!He fled, and left me here,Another Ariadne's fate,To mourn the live-long year.He fled — but oh! what pains the heart must prove,When we reveal the crimes of him we love!Re-enter SYLVIA.SYLVIA.I cannot bring him now — in yonder streamThat thro' its pebbled channel glides alongSoft-murm'ring to the sea, he stands to coolHis beauteous form in the pure limpid rill.But still he shall be your's —CONSTANTIA.To thee, my child,To thee he causes joy — but joy to meThere's nothing now can bring — left by my husband!By the false barb'rous man! —SYLVIA.And yet this manYou still regret mdash; you must excuse me now —I vow, I can't but think, 'midst all your grief,All your reproaches, your complaints against him,That still this man, this cruel fell deceiver,Has found,—I know not why—within your breastSome tender advocate, to plead his cause.CONSTANTIA.No, Sylvia, no; my love is turn'd to hate! —SYLVIA.Then dry your sorrows and this day beginA happier train of years — and lo! the sunEmerges from the sea — He lists his orbAbove the purpled main, and streams abroadHis golden fluid o'er the world — the birdsExulting wake their notes — all things rejoice,And hills, and groves, and rocks, and vallies smile.Let me entreat you then forget your cares,And share the general bliss.—The sun is seen to rise at a distance, as it were out of the sea.CONSTANTIA.Once more all hail,Thou radiant power, who in your bright careerOr rising or descending, hast beheldMy never-ceasing woe! — again thou climb'stIn orient glory, and recall'st the caresAnd toils of man and beast—but oh! in allYour flaming course, your beams will never lightUpon a wretch so lost, so curst as I am.SYLVIA.And yet, my mother—CONSTANTIA.Mine are pangs, my child,Strokes of adversity no time can cure,No lenient arts can soften or assuage.But I'll not grieve thee, Sylvia — I'll retireTo some sequester'd haunt—There, all forlorne,I'll sit, and wear myself away in thought.Exit.SYLVIA,alone.Alas! how obstinately bent on griefIs her whole mind! — the votarist of care!In vain I try to soften her afflictions,And with each art beguile her from her woe.I chide, intreat, caress, and all in vain.And what to me seems strange, perverse, and wond'rous,The more I strive, the more her sorrows swell;Her tears the faster fall, fall down her cheekIn streams so copious, and such bitter anguish,That I myself at length, I know not how,Catch the soft weakness, and o'erpow'r'd with grief,Flow all dissolving in unbidden tears.Assist her heav'n. — Her heart will break at last —I tremble at the thought — I'll follow straightAnd still implore, beseech, try evr'y wayTo reconcile her to herself and me.But see, look yonder! what a sight is there!What can it mean, that huge enormous massThat moves upon the bosom of the deep!— A floating mountain! — no — a mountain neverCould change its place — for such a monstrous bulkHow light it urges on its way — how quick,How rapid in its course! — What can it be—— I'll tow'rd the shore, and from the pointed rockThat juts into the waves, at leisure viewThis wond'rous sight, and what it is explore.END of the first ACT.ACT II.SCENE, Another view of the island, with an opening to the sea between several hills and rocks.Enter SYLVIA.SYLVIA.STILL I behold it—still it glides alongThro' the tumultuous sea — and lo! before itThe waves divide! and now they close again,Leaving a tract of angry foam behind.It must be, sure, some monster of the deep;For see! — upon its huge broad back it bearsExpanded wings, that, spreading to the wind,Lie broad incumbent o'er the surge beneath —— Ah! save me, save me! — what new forms appear!What shapes of unknown being rise before me!From yon huge monster"s side they issue forth,And bolt upon the shore! — behold, they stop,And now with eager disconcerted pacePrecipitate rush forward on the Isle, —Now 'mongst the rocks they wind their silent way,FERDINAND and HENRICO appear.Protect me, heav'n! defend me! shield me!—ah!Hide me, ye woods, within your deep recess;Ne'er may these monsters penetrate your haunts;Ne'er trace my footsteps thro' your darksome ways.Behind the covert of this woodbine bow'rOh! let me rest conceal'd! —She retires.FERDINAND and HENRICO come forward.HENRICO.No trace appears,No vestige here is seen of human kind.'Tis drear, 'tis waste, and unfrequented all.And hark! — what noise? — from yonder toil∣ing deepHow dreadful sounds the pealing roar! — my friend,My valued Ferdinand, 'twere best retire.This cannot be the place. —FERDINAND.Oh! my Henrico,This is the fatal shore — the well-known scene,Yon bay, yon rocks, yon mountains, from whose browsTh' imbow'ring forest over-hangs the deep,Each well-remember'd object strikes my view,Answers the image in my mind preserv'd,Engraven there by love's recording-hand,And never, but with life, to fade from thence.HENRICO.And yet thy love-enfeebled soul may formImaginary tokens of resemblance.This soil unbeaten seems by mortal step.FERDINAND.No, my Henrico, no — this is the spot —My heart in ev'ry pulse confirms it to me.This is the place, the very place, where fateBegan to weave the tissue of my woes.Oh! I was curst, abhorr'd of heav'n, or elseI ne'er had trusted the contentious waves,But kept my store of happiness at home.HENRICORepine not for an action that aroseFrom filial piety, — a father's mandateRequir'd obedience from you. —FERDINAND.To his summonsI paid a glad attention — yet, good heav'n!Why in that early aera of my blissShould then his orders come, to dash my joys? —Oh! I was blest with all that rarest beauty,With all that ev'ry Venus of the mind,The tender heart, and the enliven'd witCould pour delightful on the raptur'd senseOf the young bridegroom, whose admiring eyesStill hung enamour'd on her ev'ry charm,And thence drank long inspiring draughts of love,Unsated still, — still kindling at the view.HENRICO.Thy fate indeed was hard —FERDINAND.Heav'n knows it was —Each soft desire, each joy refin'd was mine —The hours soft glided by, and as they pass'dScatter'd new blessings from their balmy wings;They saw our ever new delight; they sawA blooming offspring crown our mutual loves;The mother's features, and her ev'ry graceIn this our daughter exquisitely trac'd.But to be torn from that supreme of bliss, —My wife, — Constantia, — and my beauteous babe,Here to be left on this untravell'd isle,To pine in bitterness of want! — their bedThe cold bare earth, while the inclement windsFrom yonder main came howling round their heads,Until at length the friendly hand of deathIn pity threw his shrowd upon their woes.HENRICO.Too sure, I fear, they're lost. —FERDINAND.Perhaps, my friend,Perhaps when gasping in the pangs of death,——When ev'ry beauty faded from her cheek,—And her eye languish'd motionless and dim,Perhaps ev'n then, in that sad dismal hour,My name still hover'd on her quiv'ring lips,And nought but death could tear me from her heart.HENRICO.Her tend'rest thoughts no doubt were fix'd on thee.FERDINAND.Her tend'rest thoughts! oh! no — her utmost rage—Who knows, Henrico, but she deem'd me false;Deem'd me a vile deserter from her arms?She did, — she must — each strong appearance join'dTo mark me guilty —Oh! that thought strikes deepIt's scorpion stings into my very heart.Could she but think me so refin'd in guilt,So exquisite a villain, as to causeA moment's anguish in that tender breast,Where all the loves, where all the virtues dwelt,—'Twere misery, — 'twere torture in th' ex∣treme—And yet she thought me such—by heav'n she did—Accus'd me of the worst, the blackest treason,Of treason to my love — stung with th' ideaShe roam'd this isle, and to these desert wildsPour'd forth her lamentable tale; — who knowsBut on some craggy cliff whole nights she satRaving in madness to the moon's pale gleam;Until at length all kindling into phrenzy,Clasping her infant closer to her breast,With desperation wild from off the rockHeadlong she plung'd into the roaring waves,While her last accents murmur'd faithless Fer∣dinand.HENRICO.Distract not thus your soul with fancied woes.She could not think thee faithless; thee, whose mind,Whose ev'ry virtue were so well approv'd.FERDINAND.Still will I hope she did not. — Oh! she knewI made that voyage in duty to a father.A while we steer'd a happy course, untilBeneath the burning line, from whence the sunIn streight direction pours his ardent blazeOn ev'ry fever'd sense, a storm arose,Sudden and wild; as if a war of natureWere thund'ring o'er our heads — full twenty daysIt drove us headlong on the dashing surgeFar from our destin'd way, until at lengthIn evil hour we landed on this isle.SYLVIA returns, and peeps from behind a hedge.SYLVIA.Methought I heard a sound, as if they bothHeld mutual converse — yonder lo! they stand —They do not follow me — what can they be! —FERDINAND.There is the spot, just where yon aged treeImbrowns the plain beneath, on which the villains,The unrelenting band of pirates, seiz'd me —There I receiv'd my wound, and there I foughtTill my sword shiver'd in my hand — worn out,Oppress'd by numbers, pow'rless, and disarm'd,They bore me headlong to the beach; in vainPiercing the air with horrid cries; in vainBack towr'd the cave, where poor Constantia slept,With her lov'd infant daughter in her arms,Straining my ardent eyes — my eyes alone!For oh! their cruelty had bound my arms,And tears and looks were all I then could use.SYLVIA.The voice but indistinctly strikes my ear,Would they would turn this way. —FERDINAND.Fetter'd, ty'd down,They dragg'd me to the vessel—bore me hence—In vain our ship pursued—In vain gave chase—Form'd with detested skill the guilty barkIn which they plung'd me, gliding oe'r the mainOutstripp'd their tardy course — they steer'd awayFar to their regions of accursed bondage,Far from Constantia, far from ev'ry joyA doating husband, and delighted fatherFeels in mix'd rapture with his wife and child.Oh! I could pour my plaints — but I'll not woundThy ear, my friend, with further lamentation.HENRICO.Would Heav'n I could remove the cause —FERDINAND.Alas!That cannot be — Thou can'st not bid returnThe irrevocable flight of time; recallThe moments of our young delight; annulAnd render void, what once the hand of fateHath from it's stores of woe, pour'd down upon me.SYLVIA(half concealed.)Why will they stand with looks averted thus?I long to see their countenance and mein.FERDINAND.But yet, thou best of friends, yet grant me this;Assist my search; — oh! let me roam aroundThis fatal shore — the isle's circumferenceCircles a scanty space — we cannot loseEach other here — do thou pursue that pathThat leads due east — this way I'll bend my course.HENRICO.By heav'n there is no task of hardihoodOf toil, or danger but I'll try for thee;For thee, my friend; — to thee I owe my life,And that more precious boon, my liberty:Thou hast releas'd me from the galling chain,From slav'ry's bitter pressure — 'twas thy skil,That form'd the plan of freedom, seiz'd the vessel,And made your friends the partners of your flight.— For thee I'll roam around — but oh! I fearOur search will prove in vain —FERDINAND.Too sure it will —And yet it is the doom of love like mineTo dwell for ever on the sad ideaOf the dear object lost; to visit oftA lonely pilgrim ev'ry well known scene,Each haunted glade, where the lov'd object stray'd;To call each circumstance of pass'd delightBack to the soul; in fond excursions seekThe dear lamented shade — Then, oh! my friend,Then let me taste that sad, that pensive comfort,Range thro' these wilds; ascend each craggy steep,Try in each grotto, in each gloomy caveIf haply there remain some vestige of Constantia,Exit.HENRICO.On yonder beach we'll meet again — fare∣well! —SYLVIA.Conceal thee Sylvia;—ah!—it comes this way!—Then let me seek the covert of the woods,Where nods the brownest horror; there lie safeFrom the unusual sight of these strange beings.Exit.HENRICO,solus.How cruel is my friend's condition! —doom'dFor ever to regret, yet never findThe object of his soul — his early loveHe lavish'd all on her — with her it goesTo the dank grave, and leaves him hapless hereTo die a lingering death. — Yet still I'll tryBv ev'ry office friendship can performTo heal the wound that preys upon his life.Exit.The back scene closes, and presents a thick wood; then enter SYLVIA.SYLVIA.What have my eyes beheld? — my flutt'ring heartBeats quick in stange emotions — from yon groveOf tufted trees, I saw this nameless beingWalk o'er, the russet heath — it's face appear'dConfess'd to view — It cannot be a man —No lines of cruelty deform'd his visage.—Were it a man, his untam'd savage soulWould strongly speak in each distorted fea∣ture —This was all pleasing, amiable and mild:A gentle sorrow, bright'ning into smiles,Such as bespoke a calm, yet feeling spirit,Sat on its' peaceful brow, and oe'r it threwA gentle gleam of sweetness and of pain.— It cannot be a woman neither — no —The dress accords not with that mode, which oftMy mother hath describ'd — Whate'er it beAttraction dwells about it; winning smiles;Assuasive airs of tenderness and joy.I'll seek my mother — she perhaps may knowThese forms, to me unusual — By this rowOf darksome pines, my steps all unperceiv'dMay gain the place where with assiduous handShe works, and teaches the rude rocks to tellHer mournful elegy — what mean my feet?—Why stand they thus forgetful of their office?—Why heaves th' involuntary sigh! — and whyThus in quick pulses beats my heart? — my eyesA misty dimness covers—In my earsStrange murmurs sound — my very breath is lost—What can it be?—I know thee fear!—'tis thouThat causest this! — and yet it can't be fear—Fear cannot thrill with pleasure thro' the veins;Knows not this dubious joy—these grateful tremblings—I cannot guess what these emotions mean,Nor what this busy thing my heart would want!Let me seek shelter in my mother's arms.Exit.Scene changes to the first view of the island where CONSTANTIA'S inscription is seen.Enter FERDINANDFERDINANDNo—never more shall these fond eyes behold her.Lost, lost, my poor Constantia lost! — In vainI search these gloomy woods — In vain call outHer honour'd name to ev'ry hill and dale.My eyes are false, or on the craggy baseOf yonder rock some instrument appears,The mark of human kind —Takes it up.A broken sword!Oh! all ye heav'nly pow'rs! — the very same—This once was mine — unfaithful to it's trustIt fail'd me at my utmost need — I seeThe well known characters; the very wordsThat form'd it's motto —'tis, it is the same —Oh! were Constantia found! — what do I see?All o'er with hair the flinty rock bestrew'd! —These were her decent tresses—these in anguishShe tore relentless from her beauteous head,Up by the roots she tore, and scatter'd wildTo all the passing winds—she still may live!—Constantia? — my belov'd, — my life, return!—Constantia! — ha! —what mystic charactersAre hewn into the rock? — my name appears—He reads.STOP TRAVELLER.

the land of beauteous dames;'Mongst whom thy matchless excellence shall shineWith undiminish'd radiance, and exertIt's gentle pow'r, by innocence endear'd,By virtue heighten'd, and by modest truthAttemper'd to such sweetness, that each fairWith unrepining heart, and glad consentShall own thy rival claim; and ev'ry youthTouch'd by the graces of thy native beauty,Shall join to make thy form the public care.SYLVIA.I cannot quit this island;—cannot leaveThese woods, these lawns, these hills and deep∣ning vales,These streams oft-visited, each well known hauntWhere hand in hand with innocence I've stray'd,And tasted joys serene as in the air,That pants upon yon trembling leaves.—FERDINAND.Such joysFor thee shall blossom in thy native land,And new delights arise. There cultur'd fieldsWave with the golden harvest; commerce poursEach delicacy forth; there stately domesAttract the wond'ring eye; there cities swarmWith busy throngs intense, and smiles aroundA scene of active, cheerful, social life.Thither I'll lead thee, sweet—SYLVIA.And yet my heartMisgives me much:—does not contention there,And civil discord render life a sceneOf care, and toil, and struggle? — does not warFrom foreign nations oft invade the land,With all his train of misery and death?FERDINAND.Thy lovely fears are groundless — ours the landWhere inward peace diffuses smiles around,And scatters wide her blessings — there a king,—(My friend comes later thence, and tells me all)There reigns a happy venerable kingDispensing justice and maintaining lawsThat bind alike his people and himself.From that scource liberty and ev'ry claimA free-born people boast, flow equal onAnd harmonize the state; while in the eveAnd calm decline of life our monarch seesA royal grandson still to higher lustreEach day expanding; emulous to traceHis grandsire's steps, to copy out his actions;And bid the ray of freedom onward stretchTo ages yet unborn.SYLVIA.And do the peopleKnow their own happiness?FERDINANDThey do, my sweet:Pleas'd they behold their native rights secur'd;Their commerce guarded, and the useful arts,That raise, that soften, and embellish life,All to perfection rising. With a senseOf their own blessing touch'd, with one consentThey pour their treasures, and exhaust their bloodIn their king's righteous cause; and Albion thusRaises her envied head; thus ev'ry threatOf foreign force, each menace of invasionFrom a vain, vanquish'd, disappointed foe,Like broken billows on her craggy cliffs,Shall murmur at her feet in vain.—SYLVIA.MethinksI long to see this place—FERDINAND.My Sylvia, yes,Thou shalt return—propitious gales invite—Come then, Constantia—oh! what mix'd emo∣tionsHeave in this bosom at the sight of thee?—CONSTANTIA.I too run o'er with ecstacy of joy,And tears must speak my happiness—I longTo utter all my fond, fond thoughts;—to tellThe story of my woes, and hear of thine;While at each word our hearts shall melt within us,And thrill with gries, with tenderness, and love.FERDINAND.The tale shall serve us in our future hoursOf tender intercourse, to sweeten pain,To calm adversity, and teach our soulsTo bend in love, in gratitude, and praiseTo the All-good on high, who thus befriendsThe cause of innocence; who thus rewardsOur suffering constancy; whose hand, tho' slow,Thus leads to rapture thro' a train of woe.FINIS.
