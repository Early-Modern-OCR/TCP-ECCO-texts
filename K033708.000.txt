JUDITH. AN ORATORIO.ACT I.SCENE I.Chorus of Israelites.FATHER of Mercies lend thine Ear,Behold us with a pitying Eye.Thy wretched suppliant People hear,Help, help, O Lord! or else we dye.CHARMIS. Chorus.Char.Well may ye mourn, O miserable Race!Well may ye mourn: The Angel of DestructionEven now on Wing malignant hovers o'er us,And show'rs upon our Heads the Wrath of Heaven.A Man.Ye are the Cause, ye Governors and Rulers,Of the dire Mischiefs that are fallen upon us.Why sought ye not a Peace with these AssyriansE'er they approach'd our City? Now their TroopsEncompass us about, have seiz'd our Springs,And thro' a Dearth of Water all must perish.AIR.A Wo.O Torment, great, too great to bear!Parch'd up with Thirst I burn, I rage;Distraction! Horror! and Despair,Give me this Fury to asswageOne Drop, from some yet moist'ned BowlTo cool the Fever in my Soul!SCENE II.OZIAS, CHARMIS, Chorus.A Man.Throw wide our Gates, let Holofernes enterWith all his Troops, and spoil us! we will serve him.It's better so to serve, than to beholdOur Wives and Children die before our Faces.Ozias.Brethren take Courage, let us yet endureFive Days, and if within that Space the LordTurn not his Mercy towards us, we will doAccording to the Words ye now have spoken.AIR.Be humble, suff'ring, trust in God,Who joys not with the chast'ning Rod,To shew his Power Divine;No, he is Good as well as Great,And Men, that will not patient wait,Rebel, when they repine.SCENE III.JUDITH, ABRA.Jud.Have then our Miseries at length subdued us?And must those Heathens lord it o'er the RaceOf abject Israel?Abra.Within five DaysBithulia shall be plundered, our young MenSlain with the Sword, our Virgins violated;And the small Remnant must groan out a LifeIn Slavery and Exile.Jud.Know'st thou notWhat Wonders the Almighty can perform?Oh weak of Faith! should God stretch forth his Arm,Is it too late to save his sinking People?I feel my Spirit stirr'd with strange Emotions.Raise, raise some potent Strain, whilst I retireing,In holy Meditation seek the Lord.AIR.Abra.Wake my Harp! to melting Measures,Pour thy softest, sweetest Treasures,Such as lift the Thoughts on high;'Till the rapt Soul, Earth forsaking,Heaven-ward it's Flight is taking,On the Wings of Harmony.SCENE IV.JUDITH, ABRA.Jud.Where are the Ancients of the City?—Lead me,This instant lead me to them; with some vastDesign my Soul is big! Yet what am I,Most Gracious! what am I, that thou shouldst doThis Thing, and by an Instrument so feebleBlazon thy glorious Name among the Nations.AIR.Adventurous, lo! I spread the Sail,Steering where Patriot Virtue guides;That marks my Passage, 'points the Gate,And Pilot at my Helm presides.With stedfast Heart I quit the Shore,Nor Man's Assistance deign to court;The Star of Mercy goes before,In Promise of a joyful Port.SCENE V.OZIAS, CHARMIS, JUDITH, ABRA, Chorus of IsraelitesOzias.Brethren, behold! the Widow of Menasses,Judith, for Wisdom, and for Beauty fam'd:This way she comes attended by her Damsel.Daughter, what wouldst thou?Jud.Hear me, O ye Rulers!Ye have not rightly done to tempt the Lord,By swearing, that unless within five DaysHe turn'd to help us, ye would yield the City.Charm.Th' rash Inhabitants compell'd us to it.But thou implore the Lord, that he may sendRain from the Clouds, and we shall faint no more.Chorus of Israelites.When Israel wept, no Comfort nigh,Thou heardst, O Lord, thy People's Cry:Tender as Shepherd of his Flock,When thro' the Desart they were led,From Heav'n thy Bounty gave them Bread,And pour'd them Water from the Rock.Jud.Hear me! I mean to do an Act shall go,Throughout all Generations: I will goForth from the City to the Assyrian CampWith this my Virgin; and within the TimePrescrib'd, the Lord shall save ye by my Hand.But question not the Scope of my Design.For nought I will divulge 'till all be finish'd.AIR.Remember what Jehovah sworeTo Abram, and his Seed of yore,Above 'tis on Record;With this right Hand I plant thy Race,No Power shall root it from its Place;So spoke the living Lord.And Suns may melt, and Stars decay,Both Heaven and Earth shall pass away,But not his sacred Word.SCENE VI.OZIAS. CHARMIS.Char.She breaths prophetic Strains! depart in Peace,And the Lord God go with thee. Wonder notMy Brethren, that upon this Woman's StrengthWe rest our Hopes of Safety! through the TribesThe Fame of her Religion is gone forth;And know, a single Champion so provided,Is better than a Host of the Prophane.AIR.Conquest is not to bestowIn the Spear, or in the Bow;Nor does Victory belongTo the Valiant, or the Strong.But the Pious and the Just,Those who in Jehovah trust;To their Foes the Sword may give,They shall triumph, they shall live.SCENE VII.OZIAS, CHARMIS, Chorus of Israelites.Ozias.Lo! where fair Judith issuing from the Gate,With her Attendant, now descends the Mountain:How beautiful she looks, and with what VigourShe treads along!—'Tis God! 'tis God inspires herTo some great Purpose; laud his holy Name.Chorus of Israelites.Hear! Angels, hear!—Celestial Choirs,In Rapture catch your golden Lyres.With us your Voices raise;To him the first and last be givenIn lowest Earth, in highest Heaven,All Glory, Power, and Praise.END of the FIRST ACT.ACT II.SCENE I.HOLOFERNES, JUDITH, ABRA.Jud.Thus, noble Holofernes, thou hast heardWhy with this Virgin I forsook yon City;Because the Inhabitants by Crimes most odious,Where drawing on themselves the Wrath of Heaven.When the dread Hour is nigh, God shall forewarn me,And I, by secret Passes, will conductThee, and thy Troops, to the devoted Walls:Nor shall Bethulia only fall a Prey,But all Judea.Hol.Wonder of thy Sex! what Language can expressMy Admiration?—What Words do Justice to thy Excellence?For Comeliness of Form, and Strength of Mind,There is not such another.Jud.Spoke my LordTo his poor Handmaid?—Let me not suppose it.Far be such vain Thoughts from the Wretch that toilsIn this dark Vale of Sin and Misery.AIR.Oh! strive not with ill-suited Praise,Thy Servant's humble Mind to raise.God be my Pride, his holy Ways,My Ornaments alone:This Merit only rests with me,That, through the Veil of Charity,Another's Blemishes I see,Whilst I lament my own.SCENE II.HOLOFERNES, JUDITH, ABRA, Chorus of Assyrians.Hol.Strait thro' the Camp let this Command be issued,That none presume t'approach the Hebrew Women,But with such due Respect and Reverence,As suits the Friends of the Assyrian King.An unmolested Passage let them find,And ample Liberty to observe their Laws,Their Customs, and Religion.Chorus of Assyrians.Live for ever!Nebuchodonosor and Holofernes!Hol.Come, lovely Judith, for thy ResidenceYonder superb Pavilion we assign.AIR.Adorn'd with every matchless GraceBy Heaven from whence she sprung;We view the Goddess in her Face,We hear it in her Tongue.Against such Charms, there's no Defence;O take! Possess me whole!Thy Beauty captivates my Sense,Thy Wisdom quells my Soul.Chorus of Assyrians.Rejoice! Rejoice! Judea falls,Yon stubborn City bows her Walls;Victors we come, her Gates display,And Desolation marks our Way.While every Sword from Slaughter reeks,The Virgin cries, the Matron shrieks;Thro' her pale Streets Groans, Shouts resound,And all her Turrets flame around.SCENE III.JUDITH, ABRA.Jud.Thus far the Lord hath led us by the Hand,Till in the Midst of these IdolatersWe are set down. But know, like Sparks of FireLodg'd in a Heap of Stubble, we shall soonBlaze and consume them. Only thou, my Sister!Beware of their Deceptions. Nor with FlatteryLet them intoxicate our Reason.Abra.Never.The Praise of the Abandon'd to the EarOf Virtue, sounds but like the Serpent's HissAs timely Warning to avoid its Sting.Too well by thy Example am I taughtTo scorn the glittering Gewgaws they esteem.AIR.Vain is Beauty gawdy Flow'r,Pageant of a Day, an Hour,Born just to bloom and fade;Nor less weak, less vain than itIs the Pride of human Wit,The Shadow of a Shade.SCENE IV.JUDITH, ABRA, Chorus of Assyrians.Jud.Soft, break we off, what wanton Troop comes yonder?This Way they bend their Steps. Now speak your Errand.If from the Great, the gracious Holofernes,Ought in Command ye bear, behold a Vassal,Submissive to the Pleasures of her Lord.A Man.Thus then our general greets the peerless Judith.To Night he holds a Banquet, and her PresenceOnly is wanting to compleat its Splendor.Further he charg'd me—but I need not speak it,Charms have the Hebrews, and the Assyrians Hearts.A Wo.Come, beauteous Stranger! give a Loose to Joy—Our General amidst the Noise of War,Has a Soul tun'd to all the softer Passions—Enough, she smiles Consent, return we backWith the glad Answer of our Embassy.AIR.Haste to the Gardens of Delight,Blest Scenes! where plenteous Pleasures grow;Where Fruits luxuriant charm the Sight,And court the Hand from every Bough.No Churls are bid to Nature's Treat,The Goods the Gods provide, employ;To thank the Givers pluck and eat,And satisfy the Soul with Joy.SCENE V.JUDITH, ABRA.Jud.The Lyon's in the Toils, we have him fast,And never shall he walk abroad againTo make the Forests tremble: Hie we henceTo this same Banquet, yet imagine not,That my chaste Body I will render upTo fulsome Purposes; no, God shall save me;To whose Almighty Guidance I resignMyself this Night. Fall prostrate on the Earth,Join me in fervent Prayer from Heart and Voice,Let our warm Vows in Unison aspire.DUET.Oh thou, on whom the Weak depend,Creator! Father! Champion! Friend!Source divine of every Blessing,Merciful beyond expressing,To thy vow'd Votarist's Suit attend.Inspiration pure impart,Nerve her Arms and steel her Heart.Not sung. 
Kind Influence shed on this important Hour, And as thou giv'st her Courage, grant her Power.SCENE VI.HOLOFERNES.Crown me with Laurels, bring the Chaplets hither,With Roses and with Myrtle bind each Brow,For we to-day are Conquerors.
