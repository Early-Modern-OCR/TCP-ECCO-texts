TIMANTHES: A TRAGEDY.[Price One Shilling and Sixpence.]TIMANTHES: A TRAGEDY.As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN COVENT-GARDEN.BY JOHN HOOLE.LONDON: Printed for T. BECKET and Co. in the Strand.M.DCC.LXX.PROLOGUE.Spoken by Mr. BENSLEY.WHEN first our bard advent'rous left the shore,To tempt the drama's depth, untry'd before;With beating heart his trembling sail he rear'd,While critic sands and envious rocks he fear'd.But your indulgence swell'd the prosp'rous wind,And sase convey'd him to the port design'd.The track, yourselves approv'd, he now pursues,And for a second trip his care renews.Oft, in the silent hours of teeming thought,As flatt'ring prospects in his bosom wrought,Hope imag'd to his sight your starting tear,And brought the welcome plaudit to his ear!But while he now revolves that mutual fameShould join the poet's and the actor's name,O! let him here one tender tribute pay,To early worth, untimely snatch'd away!To HIM, who once, alas! his scene inspir'd,Whose softness melted, and whose spirit fir'd!While to the friend this grateful debt he pays,Each gen'rous breast will sure confirm the praise;With you, his honest zeal must stand approv'd,Which makes this off'ring to the man he lov'd!Dramatis Personae.DEMOPHOON, Mr. BENSLEY.TIMANTHES, Mr. SMITH.CHERINTHUS, Mr. WROUGHTON.MATHUSIUS, Mr. CLARKE.ADRASTUS, Mr. GARDNER.ORCANES, Mr. DAVIS.OLINTHUS, a Child.ISMENA, Mrs. YATES.CEPHISA, Mrs. BULKLEY.Officer, Guards, Attendants; Chorus of PRIESTS and VIRGINS.SCENE, Thrace.TIMANTHES: A TRAGEDY.ACT I.SCENE, The palace.Enter ADRASTUS and ORCANES▪ORCANES.TIMANTHES is arriv'd.ADRASTUS.The setting sunGilds his returning ensigns.—Great DemophoonPrepares to welcome home his conquering son,And meet him with a father's love.ORCANES.And yetAmidst this hour of triumph, sorrow cloudsThe splendor of a victor's arms: this eveFore-runs a day of sad solemnity.ADRASTUS.Orcanes, yes—that sun, whose chearful lightSmiles on the harmless swain, that piping leads
His flock to fold, must, ere to-morrow's noon,Behold his altar stain'd with guiltless blood.Thou know'st long since the oracle requir'dA virgin's life in annual sacrifice;And every year, on this returning day,In solemn rites our weeping Thrace gives upThe melancholy victim.ORCANES.Have the priestsReceiv'd the virgins yet, whose names must standTo-morrow's dreadful chance?ADRASTUS.Not yet—and thenceI fear new evils may arise: 'tis whisper'd,I know not what, of something that portendsContest and tumult to the state: Mathusius,The hoary chief, beneath whose fostering careOur young Timanthes learn'd the trade of war,Grown old in toils, an alien to the court,Now lives sequester'd, since the king displeas'dRecall'd him from command, and in his steadLeft his brave son to guide the Thracian files:Retir'd he dwells, where on the city's skirtsThe sea in tempests breaks; or where, in calms;Its glassy waves reflect the trembling towers;With him resides his daughter fair Ismena.ORCANES.The coldness 'twixt Demophoon and MathusiusHas reach'd the public notice; born to shineIn camps alone, Mathusius has not learntThe soft address to rise in courts.ADRASTUS.'Tis true,And bred with him, Timanthes has imbib'd
His temper's warmth, which oft, by youth inflam'd,Flies to extremes—Cherinthus, his young brother,Is form'd of softer mould; yet both possessDemophoon's heart; and born of different queens,He in Timanthes seems to prize the giftsOf manly fortitude, while in CherinthusHe loves the milder virtues that reviveHis queen Serena's memory.ORCANES.CherinthusIs now expected from the Phrygian land,Sent by Demophoon on some embassyOf high concern—but see the king approaches.Enter DEMOPHOON attended.DEMOPHOON.'Tis well—Mathusius' absence on the eveOf this important day, when he should meetMy conquering son, the pupil of his arms,Argues a stubbornness and disregardA sovereign ill can brook: we own his deeds,His years of service for the state;—but tellThe all-presuming man, that merit, selfO'er-rated, cancels its reward—Adrastus,Ought hears't thou of Cherinthus?ADRASTUS.No, my liege,But to the Thracian port, the fav'ring windsMust bring his vessel, ere the close of eve.Forgive a subject's freedom, but you seemOppress'd with secret care.DEMOPHOON.The time, Adrastus,Now calls for meditation, and how few
Are a king's hours of peace, whose every dayTeems with some counsel for the public weal.ADRASTUS.Yet this auspicious day my king must ownSets not with common lustre; when your son,The brave Timanthes, from the Scythian land,Adds to his father's brow new wreaths of fame,And to his people gives the palms of peace.No, sacred sir, the hardy sons of ThraceDid never celebrate with greater joyA conquering chief's return.DEMOPHOON.Well pleas'd I hearMy faithful people's shouts ascend the sky;And sympathize in those exulting sounds,That to the much-lov'd name of my Timanthes,Join every wish—but hark! the victor comes.Enter TIMANTHES attended.TIMANTHES.Royal sir!To whom Timanthes owns the double tieOf son and subject; see him now return'dFrom Scythia's kingdom with success and conquestTo grace a father's throne—DEMOPHOON.Timanthes, rise:The king and father give thee double welcome,And treble praise to Mars the armipotent,That gives Demophoon in his darling sonHis kingdom's best defender.TIMANTHES.Thanks to heaven,Whose smiles have grac'd my unexperienc'd arms,
I may, without a blush, confess my deeds:Yes, we have conquer'd; never view'd the sunA more extensive slaughter: 'midst the tumultOf fear and rage, were blended undistinguish'dThe brave, the base, the victor and the vanquish'd.The day at length was ours; if you demandA proof of this, behold yon' captive bands,Behold yon' shatter'd arms and streaming ensigns.DEMOPHOON.'Tis not alone o'er the stern Scythian foeThou spread'st thy trophies; by subduing him,Thou triumph'st in Demophoon's breast—mean-timeIn this embrace receive my pledge of love:Thy father welcomes thee—proceed, my son,Urge on thy course to honour's furthest goal,Till verging on the extreme of age, DemophoonBeholds thy fame eclipse his own—but toilsDemand refreshment, and the weary'd armOf valour gains new vigour from repose.But I have that requires thy private ear;Let all, except Timanthes, leave the presence.[Exeunt attendants.Manent DEMOPHOON and TIMANTHES.DEMOPHOON.Come near, my son—thou little think'st how muchThy happiness employs my careful breast.While in the distant fields of fame TimanthesEncounter'd dangers for his father's honour,Demophoon's thoughts were all employ'd at home,To bless his glad return with halcyon days.TIMANTHES.Have I not felt your goodness? since the timeOf early childhood to the ripening age
Of manly life, a father has preventedMy every wish.—DEMOPHOON.Thou know'st Argea dy'dEre twice six moons had taught thy tongue to lispA mother's name—two years elaps'd, once moreI try'd the nuptial band: Cherinthus crown'dThis second union—but his birth, alas!Was fatal to Serena; and with her,In me the husband dy'd; and now the fatherEngrosses all my soul.TIMANTHES.Still may TimanthesWith filial duty sooth your days in peace,And oft as war shall call your banners forthReturn with conquest home.DEMOPHOON.Thou canst not tellHow dear I hold thee—to the toil of armsLove gives its soft relief, and beauty bestSmooths the rough front of war: tho' now my yearsRoll forward, and the summer of my lifeYields to declining autumn, well I knowWhat youth has been, and what befits the ageWhen jocund spring leads up the laughing hours.TIMANTHES.Alas! my lord, let not your goodness taskTimanthes' gratitude, I ask no moreTo crown my labours than Demophoon's smiles.What bliss is wanting to that chief, whose armsDefend his sovereign's crown and guard his people?DEMOPHOON.Yes, my lov'd son, Cephisa's virgin charms,Cephisa, daughter to the Phrygian king,Shall be thy valour's great reward.TIMANTHES.Cephisa!DEMOPHOON.What mean'st thou? Wherefore hangs this sudden gloomO'er thy chang'd features? Can Cephisa's beautiesWhom sighing kings—nay more—TIMANTHES.Yet hear me, sir,Be not displeas'd with your Timanthes—Heav'n'sMy witness, gladly would I yield my life,If such a sacrifice could aught availTo insure Demophoon's peace—but I confessRepugnance here.—DEMOPHOON.Timanthes!—TIMANTHES.Tho' I own,(What fame has loudly spoken) every virtueThat decks the royal virgin, yet if aughtMy deeds have merited—DEMOPHOON.Where can we findAnother partner for Timanthes' bed,Unless a subject born?—Think not, my son,The shades of our great ancestors shall blushTo see their line disgrac'd—from them we holdThe statute, that condemns to death the subjectWho weds with royal blood; and whilst I liveI'm guardian of the laws, and will enforce themEven with severest rigour.TIMANTHES.Sacred sir—Enter ORCANES.ORCANES.The Phrygian ships, my lord, are now descry'dFull steering to the port, their spreading sailsSwell in the winds that waft them to the shore.DEMOPHOON.'Tis well—go thou, my son, to meet thy brother,And bid the princess welcome to the land:Myself would with thee, but the priests demandMy presence at the temple, to consultTo-morrow's mournful rites.TIMANTHES.[aside.]Doubts rise on doubts!This dreadful sacrifice—yet stay, my father—DEMOPHOON.What would'st thou?—speak—TIMANTHES.Alas! I know not what—Fain would I utter—but—DEMOPHOON.No more, I cannotProlong the precious time in vain debate:The terms are settled, prince—then summon allThy virtue to respect a parent's will,And dress thy looks in smiles to meet Cephisa.[Exeunt Demophoon and Orcanes▪TIMANTHESalone.Ha! dress my looks in smiles to meet Cephisa!What have I heard!—O! where's Ismena now,That once could sooth my cares! whose beauty bestSmooth'd the rough task of war—Methinks ev'n nowShe chides the lingering hours—then let me fly,
Steal unperceiv'd upon the beauteous mourner,And with Timanthes' love relieve her sorrows![Exit.SCENE, A Garden.Enter MATHUSIUS and ISMENA.ISMENA.Yet hear me, sir, nor chide your lov'd Ismena,If she presume, with unexperienc'd counsel,To guide a father's thoughts—Alas! I fearThe fond impatience of paternal tendernessBut makes that evil sure, which fortune elseMay otherwise dispose.—Has not DemophoonDispatch'd some delegates to Delphos' shrine,Once more to seek a period to the scourgeThat hangs each year on our devoted Thrace?MATHUSIUS.From thence no comfort springs—This very mornArriv'd, they from the sacred tripos broughtThis doubtful answer, that the land must groanBeneath the wrath of heaven, till to himselfTh' offender shall be known, who, guiltless now,Usurps a prince's right.ISMENA.Mysterious all!MATHUSIUS.Mean-time destruction with remorseless furyHangs o'er my child, the darling of my age▪And shall I then consent—ISMENA.Yet recollectYour wonted fortitude—why should you hopeThat, 'midst the weeping maids of Thrace, Ismena
Should stand exempted from the fatal urn?You plead the king perhaps—MATHUSIUS.And just the plea:Am I, because a subject, less a father?Apollo wills some virgin, nobly born,Should stain his altar every year with blood.Let him recall his daughter, kept at distanceWith artful policy—let him exposeHer name in yonder urn, and let him proveWhat pangs distract a wretched parent's breastWhen his heart trembles, as the priest draws nearThe sacred vase, while with a solemn mienHis lips prepare to speak the victim's name.ISMENA.Alas! my lord, cast round your eyes, beholdThe Thracian court, and mark her proudest noblesWhose hearts have shudder'd on this awful dayFor a child's threaten'd life—'tis true ArseneThe first-born off-spring of his queen Argea,Resides at distance from Demophoon's palace:But yet reflect, that, singly to refuseIsmena's name, will but incense the king:Let not my danger urge you to exposeYour age to further woe—too much alreadyHe views you with an unpropitious eye.I dread to think, if now too far provok'd,What mischief may ensue!MATHUSIUS.In vain thou tell'st meOf wrath or hatred in his breast, while reasonAsserts my cause, and heav'n inspires my thoughts.Was it for this I taught his arms to conquer,And bred his son to greatness? Yes, by me
The Scythian foe is vanquish'd; and by meThis eve Timanthes comes in triumph home▪ISMENA.Timanthes, O! my heart! [aside.] What says my father,Is then the prince return'd?MATHUSIUS.He is, Ismena,And comes in happy hour: his generous soulDisdains not to remember that MathusiusTaught his young sword to reap in glory's field▪To him I will appeal—he will, with pity,Behold a parent's sufferings.ISMENA.Yet, my father,Should the brave prince, with sympathizing heart,Plead vainly with Demophoon, O! forbearTo urge the contest further: hope, the geniusThat still has watch'd your years of danger past,Will guard your age from anguish.MATHUSIUS.Cease, Ismena,To oppose, with fruitless words, my fix'd resolve:No, if I still must be condemn'd to feelThis anguish of the soul, yon haughty monarchShall share with me those fears a father knows,Nor stand excluded from Mathusius' pangs![Exit.ISMENAalone.The tempest thickens round! my little barkThat, till this hour, has stemm'd life's boisterous wave,At length, I fear, must sink—Timanthes comes,He comes with conquest crown'd, but where are nowIsmena's smiles to meet him! Is it thus,
With tears ill-omen'd, with foreboding sighs,I give him welcome here.Enter TIMANTHES.My life! my lord!Com'st thou again, preserv'd from danger's field,To these fond arms!TIMANTHES.Yes, 'midst the sterner deedsWhich glory claim'd, thy image, present still,Sooth'd every toil—And art thou then the sameAs when I left thee at the call of honour?ISMENA.Canst thou then doubt me! If thy heart, Timanthes,In the rough shock of war, and clang of arms,Forgot not softer hours of peace and love,Think'st thou, Ismena, 'midst these shades, that oftHave witness'd to our mutual vows, would everCast off remembrance that she once was happy?TIMANTHES.Forgive the fondness of o'erflowing loveThat wishes still to hear those gentle lipsBreathe their soft vows—How fares my boy Olinthus?The precious pledge of our connubial joys,That heaven bestow'd while, distant with thy father,Four springs renewing since the Thracian grove,Timanthes march'd against his country's foes?ISMENA.Some God, that watches o'er this pledge of love,Sure crowns his tender age with growing beauty,Or the fond mother with imagin'd graceHas deck'd his infancy; his looks alreadyAssume thy manly sternness; when he smiles,
He's all thyself; and oft as I can stealA wish'd-for look, I gaze with rapture on him,And think I view Timanthes, till deceiv'dWith the dear thought, I strain him to my breast,And in the son embrace the absent father.TIMANTHES.What place contains our infant hope! O! lead,Lead me, Ismena, where these longing eyesMay in his features read a father's likeness,Or see them blooming with his mother's charms.ISMENA.Alas! my lord, awhile suppress these warmPaternal feelings—some few miles remote,Sequester'd from the city, on the edgeOf the rude forest, Arcas and Ianthe,A rustic pair, unconscious of their charge,Rear his young life—Amidst the observing eyesThat watch a prince's deeds, you must beware,And but with caution see him—Heav'n allowsTo us with scanty hand the parent's joys,In the soft moments of o'erflowing nature,To clasp him in our fond endearing arms,And bless the prattler with the tongue of transport.TIMANTHES.By heav'n it shall not be—I'll burst at onceFrom dark dissimulation's veil—'tis nowThe crisis of our fate!ISMENA.It is indeed:To-morrow's sun lights up the solemn dayOf annual sacrifice: Ismena's nameMust stand enroll'd amongst th' elected trainThat wait the dreadful chance.TIMANTHES.Ismena's name!ISMENA.'Tis so decreed,—and think not that I fearTo die for Thrace—no, for her country's sake,Ismena gladly would embrace her doom.But Phoebus' words demand a virgin's blood;Shall I, a wife and mother, dare approachHis sacred altar, an unhallow'd victim?Thus, if I speak or not, I still am guilty,My silence heav'n offends, my speech the king.TIMANTHES.The king must know the secret of our nuptials:All, all demands is now—for, O Ismena,This very hour perhaps Cherinthus bringsA rival to thy love—Cephisa comes;But now Demophoon urg'd me to receiveThe Phrygian princess—but, be witness heav'n!Not all the cruel policy of courts,Not the stern mandates of a king and father,Shall e'er dissolve those tender ties which loveHas form'd, and virtue sanctifies.ISMENA.Alas!What can it all avail! our union publish'd,Thou know'st the sentence of the law impendsOn my devoted head.TIMANTHES.A monarch made,A monarch can revoke the stern decree:Demophoon, tho' severe, is still a parent,
His kind indulgence shall avert the strokeThat threats Ismena.ISMENA.Rather let it come:Too long, Timanthes, hast thou sacrific'dThy glory to Ismena—O! reflectHow ill the name of Thracia's heir agreesWith secret nuptials and clandestine love.Let me embrace my fate—I die with joy,Since I, in death, can call Timanthes mine!TIMANTHES.O! fortune, wherefore did thy lavish handGive my Ismena every charm, yet placeHer virtues in the vale of private life?But be it so—it rests on me to amendThe partial error—Thrace, some future day,With joy shall view her partner of my throne.Farewell, my love, and let this fix'd assuranceDwell in thy mind, and calm thy troubled thoughts:Timanthes will be ever watchful o'er thee,And hold thy peace far dearer than his own.[Exeunt severally.END of the FIRST ACT.ACT II.SCENE, A sea-port.Enter CHERINTHUS, CEPHISA, and Attendants.CEPHISA.WHAT means this sadness, prince? With silent gazeYou look and sigh, and if with friendly speechI urge your converse, when you seem prepar'dTo tell me much, your fault'ring tongue is mute.Where is your wonted chearfulness? the graceThat season'd your discourse? Are you in ThraceThe same Cherinthus that I knew in Phrygia?Or is it thus, with melancholy looks,You Thracians to her lord conduct a bride?CHERINTHUS.If my afflictions bear a sad presage,On me, fair princess, every evil fall:My stars can little add to griefs like mine,Nor breathes a wretch so hopeless as Cherinthus.CEPHISA.And claims Cephisa then so little shareIn your esteem! The time has been—CHERINTHUS.ForgiveThis cold reserve—and yet believe me, fair-one,There is a something here commands my silence.CEPHISA.'Tis true, I am a woman, and your secretWere ill confided to our sex's weakness.I urge no further—lead me to the palace.CHERINTHUS.Yet hear—those eyes like light'ning pierce my soul,And all my firm resolves are lost before them.O! turn, Cephisa, and with gentler looksUnbend those brows, while trembling I confess,'Tis thou hast robb'd me of my peace—I gazeWith rapture on thy matchless charms; I ownMy love is fruitless all, that these fond wishesWould grasp they know not what: I know that deathAlone can end my pains.CEPHISA.What means Cherinthus!CHERINTHUS.I knew too well I should offend—And yetThe faults of love—CEPHISA.Forbear—I'll hear no more.—Is this the brother of Timanthes? ThisThe prince deputed by the Thracian king?And is it thus Cherinthus thinks to guardThat faith a brother and a father claim?CHERINTHUS.I own my crime—I know that every tieOf son and brother should forbid my passion.Why was I only singled by Demophoon,To bring thee to Timanthes? Could I viewThy charms, and yet resist?—I saw and lov'd.Each day beheld me near thee, while the nameOf kinsman gave a license to my tongue:
Nor did this name alone deceive the world,I was deceiv'd myself—that love, which madeMe sigh for ever for Cephisa's presence,Appear'd but duty, and a thousand timesI thought to paint the affections of a brother,While my too eager speech betray'd my own.CEPHISA.[aside.]Alas! 'twas not in vain—Cephisa tooPerceiv'd a something she would fain disown.CHERINTHUS.And yet sometimes I felt a flattering hope:Methought I oft observ'd a tender sighSteal from thy breast, view'd in thy eyes a softnessThat seem'd much more than friendship—CEPHISA.Hold, Cherinthus,Thou dost begin to abuse my easy nature.It ill befits the daughter of Nicanor,Affianc'd to Timanthes, heir of Thrace,To hear with calmness these injurious vows,At once destructive to her peace and fame.CHERINTHUS.Forgive me, princess, and I will obey;Thou shalt no more reproach my daring love,Injurious to thy glory—Spite of allThe pangs that rend my heart, conviction's forceDwells in thy words, and I'll no more offend.No, I will strive to wear the face of joy,And kindly bless my happier brother's fate.Enter TIMANTHES.Welcome, Timanthes, to thy native land,Fame, the loud harbinger of thy approach,
Has rous'd each Thracian son to hail thy presence,And I but join the common voice.TIMANTHES.ReceiveIn this embrace my thanks—but say, Cherinthus,Is this the royal fair one who forsakesHer country's gentle seat to visit Thrace,And with her beauties gild our rougher clime?CHERINTHUS.It is—Behold, while others with applauseCongratulate thy fortune, what a treasureThy brother brings, to give thee every blessingThat love and beauty can bestow.—TIMANTHES.Her looksBespeak perfection—Let Timanthes then,Imperial virgin, greet thy save arrivalFrom Phrygia's happy shore—Vouchsafe awhile,Cherinthus, to retire apart—my thoughtsRevolve some secret of import, that claimsThe princess' ear alone.CHERINTHUS.I shall obey.What can this mean? But wherefore ask, or whatAvails their converse to the lost Cherinthus?[walks aside.TIMANTHES.How shall Timanthes, beauteous princess, dressHis thoughts in apt expression? I should nowPour forth the raptures of a heart, decreedTo excellence like yours—but O! there isFatality in man, and oft when HeavenHolds out an unexpected blessing to us,Some mystery forbids—CEPHISA.What would the prince?Let not Timanthes seek the low disguiseOf art, the refuge of ignoble minds,But boldly, as he meets his foes in battle,Speak out his secret soul.TIMANTHES.The statesman oftJoins with the specious plea of public goodTwo hearts averse: our parents have decreedAn union to thyself perhaps ungrateful.Thy virtues might demand the noblest heart;But fate forbids us ever to unite:There is a bar which nothing can surmount:My father knows it not, nor must I speak it;Refuse, refuse me then, enlarge my faults,And thus preserve thy fame, my peace and life!CEPHISA.'Tis well—my lord—TIMANTHES.I see the conscious prideOf greatness rising on thy cheek—my presenceBut adds to your displeasure—my Cherinthus,The care be thine, with every mark of honour,Such as may suit her station and desert,To lead from hence the princess to the palace.[Exit.CEPHISA.What have I heard! Is this the boasted youthWhom fame extols for gallantry and arms!And is it thus he treats a virgin, sprungFrom Phrygia's scepter'd kings!—neglected! Heavens!And shall I tamely bear this outrage?CHERINTHUS.coming forward.Princess,What indignation rises in your breast?Your looks are chang'd—has then my brother—CEPHISA.Yes,I see your mutual purpose to betray me:Was it for this I left my native land,Left the lov'd arms of an indulgent father,To meet with insult on this foreign shore!To bear unmov'd the injury that waitsCherinthus' passion, and his brother's scorn?But if Demophoon—Enter ADRASTUS.ADRASTUS.To the fair Cephisa,Our sovereign wishes health; the Thracian palace,Adorn'd with every pomp, expects your presence;Demophoon now, as annual rites require,Sequester'd with the priests till morning dawn,Invokes the powers divine; mean while he sendsBy me to pay the tribute of respectYour rank demands, and to conduct you henceWhere suppliant crowds attend with duteous zeal,To pay their homage to their future queen.CEPHISA.I thank thee, lord—Cephisa hopes no lessFrom great Demophoon and her father's friend.Cherinthus, let us hence—but still rememberThy plighted word; for know, whatever chanceSubjects Cephisa to unlook'd-for insult,Yet nothing from her mind can e'er erase,Such thoughts as fit the daughter of a king.[Exeunt.SCENE changes to the garden.ISMENAalone.What would my fate!—But now Mathusius bade mePrepare for flight—and whither must I fly?What region will receive forlorn IsmenaTo end her wretched life!—O! my Olinthus,Must I forsake thy innocence, forsakeMy much-lov'd lord without one parting look!I sicken at the thought—Enter TIMANTHES.TIMANTHES.What new distressHangs o'er my love! tho' distant from thy sightMy sympathizing spirit mourn'd with thee,And whisper'd that thy sorrow claim'd my aid.ISMENA.O! no—thy cares are vain—leave, leave me thenAlone to perish—the big tempest swellsThat soon must hide me from thy sight for ever.TIMANTHES.What means Ismena!ISMENA.I must quit Timanthes,Mathusius warns me hence—but now he left me,Some dreadful purpose labouring in his breast;Yet 'ere we part, to thy paternal careI here commend my child; for me embrace him,Give him this kiss, and when his ripening ageCan feel compassion, tell him all my story.TIMANTHES.It must not be—Timanthes with the wingsOf love shall fly, o'ertake thy fleeting peaceAnd bring her back to her forsaken home.
Soon as the morning dawns I'll seek the king,With filial reverence clasp his honour'd knees:Doubt not, my love, but all shall yet be well!Enter MATHUSIUS.MATHUSIUS.My daughter, let us haste—art thou Timanthes,Son of Demophoon? Let me gaze awhile;These features once bespoke thee kind and brave,Till now I ever held thee such—but say,Is not injustice stamp'd upon thy nature,And all thy father in thy heart—O! no,Thou'rt still the same—yes, I had sought thee, prince,Thy old Mathusius, once rever'd, in theeHad vested every hope—but now 'tis past—ISMENA.Alas! my father, must Ismena thenFor ever load a parent's breast with anguish?Am I th' unhappy cause—MATHUSIUS.Now hear, Timanthes,And if thou ever held'st Mathusius dear,Thy generous breast will feel a father's pangs,A father, whom the rage of tyrant powerPursues to ruin—O! my child, my child!TIMANTHES.Mathusius, speak—Has then Ismena's nameBeen drawn to-morrow's victim?MATHUSIUS.No—DemophoonHas doom'd her life a guiltless sacrificeWithout the sentence of the fatal urn.TIMANTHES.Condemn'd to die, the lots of death undrawn.All-powerful Gods!—ISMENA.O sir! weep not for me,I merit not the tears that stain those cheeks,Too deep they enter here—no, let me bearAffliction's pressure, till the fainting senseSink with its anguish, so I may, retir'dFrom mortal eyes, indulge my griefs alone,Nor bend that hoary head to earth with sorrow.TIMANTHES.It cannot be—Mathusius, thou 'rt deceiv'd—How couldst thou kindle thus the king's resentmentAgainst her helpless life?MATHUSIUS.Because I soughtTo exclude Ismena from the lots of fate,Because I durst produce his own example:But now I met him near the temple's porch,Encompass'd by the priests; with all the warmthOf a fond father trembling for his child,I urg'd, entreated—but in vain—the kingBeheld me with an haughty eye; enrag'dMy tongue reproach'd the monarch's partial voiceThat to his subjects, prodigal of death,Gave to the bloody knife our Thracian virgins,While kept at distance from the suffering land,His own Arsene shunn'd the fatal stroke.ISMENA.I tremble for th' event—not for myself,But thee, Ismena fears—Ah! wherefore, sir,Would you for me rashly incense a powerWhich sovereigns, ever jealous, still defend?What answer made the king?MATHUSIUS.His indignationRepress'd within himself, found little vent
In words—at length—"presumptuous man, (he cry'd)"Soon shalt thou feel that still Demophoon knows"How to avenge affronted majesty."Then turning from me swift, the temple gatesReceiv'd and shut him from my sight—since whenI've heard that secret orders have been givenTo seize Ismena.TIMANTHES.Ha!—direct me Heaven,What now befits Timanthes—[Aside.ISMENA.Yes, it dawns!The work of fate now opens to my view,And all must be reveal'd—be firm, my soul,And nobly meet the trial.[Aside.TIMANTHES.Is it possible!In this extreme what course remains?MATHUSIUS.BesideThe clifted rock, mann'd with a chosen fewAnd trusty servants, rides a bark prepar'dWith secret care, that will convey us hence,To some far distant hospitable clime,Where 'tis not criminal to be a father.TIMANTHES.It must not be—O sir!—MATHUSIUS.What means Timanthes?TIMANTHES.Ismena must not quit the Thracian shore—MATHUSIUS.Not quit the Thracian shore!—now by yon' powersThat sit in judgment o'er a father's wrongs,
No human breath shall stay us—haste, my daughter,Prepare this instant to depart—TIMANTHES.Distraction!And shall I then permit—Mathusius, hear,Urge not my temper further—well thou know'stMy soul has ever held thee as her best,Her earliest guide—if I oppose thee now—MATHUSIUS.Is this thy love? Would'st thou forbid a fatherTo save his only child from cruel death?TIMANTHES.O no!—thou canst not tell how dear I prizeHer safety here—come danger in her worst,Her ugliest form, this breast shall meet the dartThat threats Ismena.MATHUSIUS.We but waste the timeThat, with destruction wing'd, unheeded flies:Away, my daughter—TIMANTHES.Not th' united forceOf earth shall bear her hence—MATHUSIUS.Nay then, the swordShall vindicate the rights a father claims.ISMENA.Hold, sir, and hear Ismena—O! Mathusius,Dost thou not see some secret labouring hereToo big for speech—thou claim'st a father's right,And sacred is that claim, but yet beware,Nor let the hasty sword, with thoughtless rage,Invade a right more sacred than your own.The prince—how shall I speak?MATHUSIUS.What new alarmRuns thro' my soul!—Is't possible!TIMANTHES.My father,For such thou art—think not thy breast can feelSeverer anguish for Ismena's dangerThan what a husband feels—MATHUSIUS.Her husband!TIMANTHES.Yes,She is, she is my wife—then judge, Mathusius,If I could bear, without the sharpest pang,To see her torn for ever from my sight.MATHUSIUS.Ah! prince, what hast thou done! thy cruel loveHas fill'd the measure of Mathusius' woes.Thou most unkind! Is this the recompense,Awaits my suffering age?—Unhappy girl!To tye the fatal knot that ends in death!ISMENA.Here prostrate at your feet, permit me nowTo own the fault excess of love inspir'd:And yet you can forgive; for if I readThose looks aright, resentment dwells not there:Nor will I plead the virtues of the prince,Tho' these, my lord, were oft your lip's fond theme,While under covert of yon' arching shade,I drank, with greedy ears, his grateful praise.MATHUSIUS.No more, my child—O! I forgive thee all—But dangers thicken round, these nuptials known,
The rigid law shall seal thee for destruction,And mock a father's sorrows.TIMANTHES.No, Mathusius,By every future hour of hop'd-for peace,My life shall be her safe-guard.Enter Officer and Guard.Officer.Pardon, sir,If, with reluctance, I obey the chargeMy sovereign gives—Guards, bear Ismena hence.MATHUSIUS.What means this violence?ISMENA.The lot is cast;Come every spirit that has fir'd my sex,Thro' the long records of succeeding time,To dare, beyond the softness of our kind,Now steel my thoughts—my fortune claims it all!So may'st thou own, my father, though one fondUnguarded hour betray'd my yielding soul,Yet shall the sufferings of this awful day,The little span of life that fate allows,Atone for every error.TIMANTHES.Death to hear!Unhand her, slaves!MATHUSIUS.Age has not yet unnerv'dThis arm so far—Officer.Forbear—if either movesTo give her aid, this dagger drinks her blood—TIMANTHES.Inhuman villain! hold—Officer.The royal mandateShall justify my deeds—Away.ISMENA.Yet stay,A moment's pause—still, still, the woman hereIs struggling in my breast—my father—Oh—I dare no further—[looking at Timanthes.MATHUSIUS.Speak—ISMENA.Think not, Mathusius,Though black adversity now folds me round,That aught of anguish for myself can shakeThy daughter's mind—No! I could bear it all!But when we view the pangs of those we love,The firmest temper shrinks, and even the tearOf weakness then is virtue—Gracious heaven!Protect, defend—I would, but must not speak—Ye powers! who read my thoughts, supply the prayerI cannot utter, and, whate'er her doom,At least, in those she loves, preserve Ismena![Exit guarded.TIMANTHES, MATHUSIUS.TIMANTHES.O! give me patience, Gods!MATHUSIUS.Earth opens not,Nor light'nings fly to punish such injustice!And shall we say Jove watches o'er mankind!Timanthes, speak—for we are now unitedIn bands of wretchedness.TIMANTHES.Go, good Mathusius,And learn the place to which they bear Ismena,For should I strive in vain to appease my father,Yet love shall point the way—MATHUSIUS.No—every hopeIs now extinct, and black despair shuts upThe gloomy prospect.TIMANTHES.Can the son in vainPlead with a father for his life, his all!O! 'tis a cause will call down every softPropitious power that feels for human sufferings,To heal the anguish of a parent's breast,To calm a lover's and a husband's pains,To arrest the hand of fate, and save Ismena!END of the SECOND ACT.ACT III.SCENE, A royal Apartment.Enter DEMOPHOON and CEPHISA.DEMOPHOON.RETURN to Phrygia, princess? Canst thou askAbruptly thus to bid adieu to Thrace?While now Timanthes with presaging hopeAnticipates the hour, decreed to blessThe prince and lover, when this solemn dayShall pass, whose rising light now faintly strikesThe sacred laurels, where the temple's groveReceives the dawn.CEPHISA.Believe me, my resolvesAre such as suit my sex and rank; the nameOf virgin and of princess both require meTo quit the Thracian palace—for TimanthesNo longer urge—DEMOPHOON.I can forgive thy anger:Nurs'd in the pleasures of the Phrygian court,A Thracian's manners may be harsh to thee:Wonder not then if so Timanthes seems,Inur'd to rugged arms; be thine the gloryTo teach him first the flowery path that leadsTo the calm dwelling of domestic sweets:What cannot charms like thine?—yes, fair Cephisa,Those eyes shall thaw the ice around his heart,And warm the youth to unexperienc'd love.CEPHISA.My lord, it cannot be—as soon this mornThat spreads the veil of sorrow o'er the land,Might raise each heart with gladness, as CephisaFind happiness in Thrace—at thy command,And thine alone, the ships can quit the port,To bear me back to my paternal land:Give orders then to loose the bark, whose sailsMust waft me hence for ever.DEMOPHOON.Think not, princess,Demophoon would detain thee while thy thoughtsRevisit Phrygia; yet permit me nowTo say I hop'd far other from the daughterOf him, whose wish'd alliance promis'd allAn anxious king and parent could demand.But yet, whate'er thy wish, till the next sun,Thou canst not hence; no vessel from the portPresumes to rear the mast, or spread the sail,Till this sad day declines.CEPHISA.Since now the lawForbids to quit the realm, I must submitTo breathe the air of Thrace—yet I respectThe friend of great Nicanor, but rememberMy father's honour and my own; nay more,Demophoon's urges me to leave a court,Where every moment's voluntary stayInsults my sex's rights, and stains my glory.[Exit.DEMOPHOONalone.Ha! whence is this? sure something lurks beneathThat yet I know not—I remember now,When first I nam'd the princess, that my son
Heard with reluctance—should he disobey—A father's just resentment—but no more,It cannot be—I am alarm'd too soon.Enter TIMANTHES.TIMANTHES.Where is my king!DEMOPHOON.Timanthes, thou art comeIn happy time—TIMANTHES.Dread sir, permit your son,To sue for grace and pardon—DEMOPHOON.Say, for whomDost thou intreat?TIMANTHES.For an unhappy victim?One, whose misfortune is her only crime,The daughter of Mathusius—DEMOPHOON.'Tis too late,Her doom is seal'd—TIMANTHES.Grant to your suppliant sonHer guiltless life!—DEMOPHOON.And dar'st thou still presumeTo name her? If thou valu'st ought my love,Forego this vain request—TIMANTHES.Alas! my father,I cannot now obey you—O! if everI have deserv'd a parent's tenderness,
If with a bosom seam'd with honest scars,I have return'd a conqueror to your arms,If e'er my triumphs in the glorious field,Have drawn the tear of pleasure from your eyes,Release, forgive Ismena—lost, unhappy,She has no friend but me to plead her cause!And shall she perish!—think you view her nowIn early bloom of life, who never knewThe thoughts of guilt, stretch'd on the fatal altarIn all the pangs of suffering—think you seeThe life-warm blood gush from her tender breast,Hear the last accents from her trembling lips,Behold her dying eyes—but thou art pale!Why look'st thou thus upon me!—O! my father!I see, I see the gracious signs of pity;Do not repent, my lord—indulge it still,For never will I quit these sacred feetTill thou hast given the word to spare Ismena.DEMOPHOON.Rise, prince—Almighty powers! what must I thinkThat with such tenderness thou nam'st Ismena.Yet mark how far my fond indulgence yields;On one condition I recall her sentence:Ismena yet may live, but if the father,Impell'd by love, forgets his just resentment,Let not the son forget the sacred tiesOf gratitude and duty—TIMANTHES.Never, neverTimanthes shall forget them, every hourTo come shall bless your goodness for this pardon,Which life itself were cheaply given to parchase.DEMOPHOON.No, my dear son, my future peace and thineAsk but one sacrifice, and all is well:
What hast thou done to offend the Phrygian princess?Learn to respect my choice in fair Cephisa—Have I not felt compassion for thy weakness?Do thou preserve my honour—think, Timanthes,Nor let the breath of rumour taint my name;Then, let us seek Cephisa, there, my son,Instruct thy lips to deprecate the angerI fear thy scorn has justly rais'd—to-morrowWe'll to the temple, thither shalt thou leadThy beauteous bride, and at the altar there,At once before th' attesting Gods fulfillWhat justice claims from thee and from Demophoon.TIMANTHES.My lord, I cannot—DEMOPHOON.Prince, thou yet hast heardThe father only; force me not to employThe king's authority.TIMANTHES.Sacred alike,I hold the dictates of the king and father,But love disdains compulsion—DEMOPHOON.In the heartOf subjects, love may rule with sovereign sway;But in a prince, on whom a nation's wealDepends, it ill beseems to sacrificeThe good of thousands to the selfish weaknessThat better fits a cottage than a throne.TIMANTHES.Hard state of royalty! if on such termsTimanthes must be king, take back, ye powers!The dignity ye gave—can Heaven decree,
That public virtue never should resideWhere the soft passions dwell? Must he, whose caresIncessant labour for the good of others,Still want that happiness he gives to all?DEMOPHOON.And dar'st thou dress thy disobedience thusIn reason's garb, to oppose my sovereign will?Hence every partial weakness—just resentmentPoints out the way to reach thy stubborn heart:This darling of thy soul, Ismena—sheShall pay the forfeit—now I see full wellWhat caus'd thy coldness—she shall die.—TIMANTHES.O heaven!DEMOPHOON.Away!TIMANTHES.Yet hear me, sir,—DEMOPHOON.I've heard too much!This day Ismena dies—TIMANTHES.Forbid it heaven!Now by yon skies—DEMOPHOON.Still dost thou linger here?TIMANTHES.I go—but should she fall—this desperate hand—DEMOPHOON.Gods! dost thou threaten!TIMANTHES.Force me not, my father,To passion's wild extreme—would'st thou preserve
The peace of thy unhappy son, preserveHis fame, his all—revoke Ismena's doom—He answers not—that look confirms her death—Farewell—but whither, whither shall I flyTo shun myself?—Ismena's image stillHangs on my sight, and haunts my tortur'd soul![Exit.DEMOPHOONalone.Where, where, Demophoon, is the mighty powerA monarch boasts, when all insult thee thus?'Tis time to assert my rights—Adrastus!Enter ADRASTUS.Haste,Give orders that the victim be prepar'dThis instant for the sacrifice.—ADRASTUS.Already,Ismena, vested in the robes of death,Expects the fatal hour.—I heard the priestsExhort her with becoming fortitudeTo yield her life a sacrifice for Thrace,While with a down-cast look the virgin stoodIn all the majesty of silent woe;And now they wait thy last command aloneTo bear her to the temple.DEMOPHOON.Her misfortuneExcites my pity; but her father's boldRebellious insults on my crown and fame,My own repose, the glory of my realm,Demand her death—the weal of Thrace requiresTimanthes' marriage with the Phrygian princess,But this Timanthes never will compleatWhile she survives—this obstacle remov'd,
The flame of stubborn love shall soon decay,And the rash youth, who now condemns my power,Shall yield obedience to a parent's will.[Exeunt.SCENE, An open part of the city.Enter TIMANTHES and MATHUSIUS.MATHUSIUS.And canst thou then partake Mathusius' fortune,A willing exile from thy father's kingdom?Think, think, my son, when thou shalt wander hence,An obscure fugitive, will then Ismena,With chaste endearments, from thy mind eraseRemembrance of the prince? Will not the phantomOf royalty still haunt thy lonely hours?Wilt thou not then regret paternal wealthAbandon'd, and a scepter lost?TIMANTHES.No more—My wife and son are dearer far than all:Each other good has no intrinsic worth;Opinion makes it great; the tender feelingsOf father, husband, are not bred by custom,Or early thoughts instill'd from infancy:The seeds are in ourselves, are with us born,Grow with our life, and but with life expire.MATHUSIUS.But how to set her free? Is she not nowEncompass'd by Demophoon's guards?TIMANTHES.The careBe mine to elude their utmost vigilance:Assisted by some chosen friends, I'll bearIsmena safe from danger.MATHUSIUS.Mighty powers!Direct our flight—each moment that detains usI'm on the rack of doubt—O! prince, rememberTo thee alone I trust my all, my lastRemains of ebbing life.TIMANTHES.Haste then, Mathusius,Ascend thy bark, and near yon rocks, that riseRight of the port, expect my coming, thitherWith all the speed of love I'll bear Ismena!—[Exeunt severally.SCENE, a view of an arch leading from the city, through which the procession for the sacrifice appears; first the guards, who range themselves on each side the stage; then a train of priests and virgins: Ismena, in white vestments, supported by two virgins, advances towards the front of the stage, while the following words are sung; the Music composed by Mr. Arnold.CHORUS.Hail God of light! whose chearing rayDispels the gloom, reveals the day,And glads the universe with all-creating sway!SONG, by a PRIEST.To him the pow'r, whose awful willTrembling mortals must fulfill,To him the dreadful altar rear,And swell the notes till Phoebus hear!CHORUS.Phoebus hear!SONG, by a VIRGIN.to Ism.] Sad victim! learn the stroke to braveThat renders Heav'n the life it gave,And sheds thy blood a land to save!CHORUS.Hear and save!ISMENA.Yet, yet, Ismena, drain the bitter dregsOf sorrow's cup—but some few painful momentsAnd all may then be well!—each step I treadLeads me still nearer to the fated landWhere I shall rest in peace—but, O! supportMy fainting sense—'tis he! what adverse powerDirects him hither, in this hour of terror,To shake my firm resolves!Enter TIMANTHES.TIMANTHES.Eyes! can it be!Ismena, speak—what means this dreadful pomp!ISMENA.At length 'tis past, and ruthless death demandsIts victim—yes, Timanthes, we must part,Demophoon has decreed my fate—even nowThese ministers of heaven receiv'd the mandate.My soul seem'd more than half releas'd, but thouHast call'd her back to life—this meeting wakesA thousand tender thoughts—TIMANTHES.Cease, cease, Ismena,It wakes distraction—shall I thus behold theeTorn from my hopes—no first—ISMENA.Alas! what meansTimanthes—TIMANTHES.Never whilst I live, this swordThat oft has mow'd my way thro' sanguine fields,Shall sleep inglorious—[lays his hand on his sword.ISMENA.Ah! what wild despairUnmans thy better sense—thou wilt but rushOn certain ruin, nor preserve my life.TIMANTHES.It shall be so—farewell![going.ISMENA.Some dreadful purposeHangs on thy brow—yet hear me—TIMANTHES.Fate cuts shortEach precious moment—still I can commandA few but trusty friends, whose blood will flowFor their Timanthes—go then—seek the temple,I'll save thee yet or die!ISMENA.Forbid it, heaven!Be calm again—TIMANTHES.Be calm!—Impossible!Is there a power on earth—let ruin come,If midst the wreck one treasure still is mine![Exit.ISMENA,Priests, Virgins, and Guards.Forbear—he heeds me not—Eternal powers!Preserve him still—for me, my mind has fix'd

I could not blame him—One wife, I'knew, was full enough to tame him.Ismena, and Timanthes, and Olinthus,Might all be happy—for I chose Cherinthus.But what a barb'rous law was this of Thrace!How cruel there was each young lady's case!A virgin, plac'd upon the dreadful roll,A hapless virgin must have stood the poll,But by Timanthes made a lucky bride,Ismena prudently disqualify'd.Ladies, to you alone our author sues;'Tis yours to cherish, or condemn his muse.The theatre's a mirror, and each playShould be a very looking-glass, they say;His looking-glass reflects no moles or pimples,But shews you full of graces, smiles, and dimples.If you approve yourselves, resolve to spare,And, critics! then attack him, if ye dare.FINIS.
