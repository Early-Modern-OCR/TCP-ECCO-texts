As Gold to Silver, Virtue is to Gold."There, London's voice: 34 "Get Mony, Mony still!" And then let Virtue follow, if she will."This, this the saving doctrine, preach'd to all,From 35 low St. James's up to high St. Paul;From him whose 36 quills stand quiver'd at his ear,To him who notches Sticks at Westminster.BARNARD in 37 spirit, sense, and truth abounds." Pray then what wants he?" fourscore thousand pounds,A Pension, or such Harness for a slaveAs Bug now has, and Bestia fain would have.BARNARD, thou art a 38Cit, with all thy worth;Bestia and Bug, Their Honours, and so forth.Yet every 39 child another song will sing," Virtue, brave boys! 'tis Virtue makes a King."True, conscious Honour is to feel no sin,He's arm'd without that's innocent within;Be this thy 40 Screen, and this thy Wall of Brass;Compar'd to this, a Minister's an Ass.41 And say, to which shall our applause belong,This new Court jargon, or the good old song?The modern language of corrupted Peers,Or what was spoke at 42 CRESSY and POITIERS?43 Who counsels best? who whispers, "Be but Great," With Praise or Infamy, leave that to fate;" Get Place and Wealth, if possible, with Grace;" If not, by any means get Wealth and Place.For what? to have a 44 Box where Eunuchs sing,And foremost in the Circle eye a King.Or 45 he, who bids thee face with steddy viewProud Fortune, and look shallow Greatness thro':And, 46 while he bids thee, sets th' Example too?If 47 such a Doctrine, in St. James's air,Shou'd chance to make the well-drest Rabble stare;If honest S* take scandal at a spark,That less admires the 48 Palace than the Park;Faith I shall give the answer 49 Reynard gave," I cannot like, Dread Sir! your Royal Cave;" Because I see by all the Tracks about," Full many a Beast goes in, but none comes out."Adieu to Virtue if you're once a Slave:Send her to Court, you send her to her Grave.Well, if a King's a Lion, at the leastThe 50 People are a many-headed Beast:Can they direct what measures to pursue,Who know themselves so little what to do?Alike in nothing but one Lust of Gold,Just half the land would buy, and half be sold:Their 51 Country's wealth our mightier Misers drain,Or cross, to plunder Provinces, the Main:The rest, some farm the Poor-box, some the Pews;Some keep Assemblies, and wou'd keep the Stews;Some 52 with fat Bucks on childless Dotards fawn;Some win rich Widows by their Chine and Brawn;While with the silent growth of ten per Cent,In Dirt and darkness 53 hundreds stink content.Of all these ways, if each 54 pursues his own,Satire be kind, and let the wretch alone.But show me one, who has it in his pow'rTo act consistent with himself an hour.Sir Job 55 sail'd forth, the evening bright and still," No place on earth (he cry'd) like Greenwich hill!"56 Up starts a Palace, lo! th' obedient baseSlopes at its foot, the woods its sides embrace,The silver Thames reflects its marble face.Now let some whimzy, or that 57 Dev'l withinWhich guides all those who know not what they meanBut give the Knight (or give his Lady) spleen;" Away, away! take all your scaffolds down," For Snug's the word: My dear! we'll live in Town."At am'rous Flavio is the 58 Stocking thrown?That very night he longs to lye alone.59 The Fool whose Wife elopes some thrice a quarter,For matrimonial Solace dies a martyr.Did ever 60 Proteus, Merlin, any Witch,Transform themselves so strangely as the Rich?" Well, but the 61 Poor—the Poor have the same itch:They change their 63 weekly Barber, weekly News,Prefer a new Japanner to their shoes,Discharge their 62 Garrets, move their Beds, and run(They know not whither) in a Chaise and one;They 64 hire their Sculler, and when once aboard,Grow sick, and damn the Climate—like a Lord,65 You laugh, half Beau half Sloven if I stand,My Wig all powder, and all snuff my Band;You laugh, if Coat and Breeches strangely vary,White Gloves, and Linnen worthy Lady Mary!But when 66 no Prelate's Lawn with Hair-shirt lin'd,Is half so incoherent as my Mind,When (each Opinion with the next at strife,One 67 ebb and flow of follies all my Life)I 68 plant, root up, I build, and then confound,Turn round to square, and square again to round;69 You never change one muscle of your face,You think this Madness but a common case,Nor 70 once to Chanc'ry, nor to The Doctor of Bedlam.Hales apply;Yet hang your lip, to see a Seam awry!Careless how ill I with myself agree;Kind to my dress, my figure, not to Me.Is this my 71 Guide, Philosopher, and Friend?This, He who loves me, and who ought to mend?Who ought to make me (what he can, or none,)That Man divine whom Wisdom calls her own,Great without Title, without Fortune bless'd,Rich 73 ev'n when plunder'd, 75 honour'd while oppress'd,Lov'd 76 without youth, and follow'd without power,At home tho' exil'd, 74 free, tho' in the Tower.In short, that reas'ning, high, immortal Thing,Just 72 less than Jove, and 77 much above a King,Nay half in Heav'n—78 except (what's mighty odd)A Fit of Vapours clouds this Demi-god.
