MDCCLXXXVII.ADVERTISEMENT.THE ATHENAID, written by the late Richard Glover, Esq was left by him, among other literary works, to Miss Glover (now Mrs. Halsey) who presents it to the Public exactly copied from her Father's Manuscript, except what regards the punctuation, and introduction of now and then a connective word, inserted by the good offices of a Friend.—The Poem was not finished early enough before Mr. Glover's decease for him to revise it, as he intended; yet, incorrect as it may be for want of such revisal, the Editor flatters herself that it will be favorably received, as the genuine work of an Author, who was ever distinguished by public approbaion.—An earnest desire of doing honor to

the memory of a deceased Parent, and also of gratifying the literary world with the Sequel to LEONIDAS, which the present Poem contains, and which together includes the most brilliant period of the Grecian History, are the motives for her Publication.ERRATA.B.

From Athens Aeschylus divine
In genius, arts, and valour, musing deepOn his endanger'd country's future doom,Repairs, invited by an evening still,To clear Ilissus, Attic stream renown'd.Beneath an oak, in solitary stateApart, itself a wood, the hero's limbsOn tufted moss repose. He grasps the lyre;Unfolded scrolls voluminous he spreadsAlong the ground: high lays repeating thence,Leonidas the Spartan he extols,And sweeps th' accordant strings. To closing dayHe bade farewel, and hail'd th' ascending starsIn music long continued; till the streamWith drowsy murmur won his eye to sleep,But left his fancy waking. In a dreamThe god of day, with full meridian blaze,Seem'd to assume his function o'er the skies;When, lo! the earth divided: through the cleftA gush of radiance dimm'd the noon-tide sun.
In structure all of diamond, self pois'd,Amid redundant light a chariot hungTriumphal. Twelve transparent horses breath'dBeams from their nostrils, dancing beams of dayShook from their manes. In lineaments of man,Chang'd to immortal, there the mighty soulOf Sparta's king apparent shone. His woundsShot forth a splendour like the clust'ring stars,Which on Orion's chest and limbs proclaimHim first of constellations. Round in carsOf triumph too arrang'd, the stately formsOf those whom virtue led to share his doom,And consecrate Thermopylae to fame.Pines tipp'd with lightning seem'd their spears; their shieldsBroad like Minerva's aegis: from their helmsAn empyreal brightness stream'd abroad:Ineffable felicity their eyes,Their fronts the majesty of gods display'd.Erect the glorious shape began to speakIn accents louder than a bursting cloud—Pentelicus, Hymettus seem'd to shakeThrough all their quarries, and Ilissus beatHis shudd'ring banks in tumult—Thou, whose museCommands th' immortalizing trump of fame,Go to the sage Hellanodics, the justElēan judges of Olympian palms;There in thy own celestial strains rehearse,Before that concourse wide, our deeds and fate.Let our example general Greece inspireTo face her danger; let the Spartan shieldProtect th' Athenians, else I died in vain.The brilliant vision, now dispersing, leavesThe wond'ring bard. He, starting, in his kenDiscerns no other than the real sceneOf shadows brown from close embow'ring wood,
Than distant mountains, and the spangled faceOf heav'n, reflected from the silver stream.But pensive, brooding o'er his country's fate,His step he turns. Themistocles, who rul'dAthenian councils, instant he accostsWith large recital of his awful dream.Obey the mandate, cries the chief: alarmTh' Olympian concourse: from the Delphian portOf Cirrha sail for Elis: on thy wayConsult Apollo in the state's behalf,Which to that function nominates thy worth:Of Xerxes' march intelligence obtain.This said, they parted. Aeschylus by dawnCommenc'd his progress, join'd by numbers arm'd,Like him to Pisa's barrier destin'd all,Electing him their chief. Five times the sun
Renew'd his orbit, five successive nightsThe moon enlarg'd her crescent, ere they reach'dPhoebean Delphi, seated on a rockAbrupt, sublime. Yet thence the curious eyeMust upward look to meet the summits blueOf double-topp'd Parnassus, where the godOracular is worshipp'd. Here they trac'dBarbarian violence profane. Consum'dWere hamlets, temples levell'd to the dust,The statues broken, each religious bow'rA burning mass of embers. Wrapt in smoke,With cinders strewn, so glows the region roundPortentous Aetna, or Vesuvius dire,Death's flaming cauldrons; when their stony ribsAnd min'ral bowels, liquefied by fire,O'erwhelm the fields, by nature left unbless'd,Alone unbless'd of all Sicania's bound,Or lovely-fac'd Hesperia. Dubious hereTh' Athenians halt, while fierce the sultry noon
Inflames the sky. From Delphi's open gates,To Attic eyes no stranger, Timon comes,Sage priest of Phoebus, magistrate unsoil'd,The public host of Athens, to the plainDescending swift with followers who bearHis buckler, spear, and armour. On his headWere ashes sprinkled: rent, his garb presag'dSome black disaster. What malignant dartOf fortune wounds thee? Aeschylus aloud,While by the hand Cecropia's host he press'd.To him the Delphian: From deserted roofs,Depopulated streets, I come to hailThee, bound by hospitable ties my friend,Thee, dear to Phoebus, by Minerva grac'd,Thy country's goddess. Me thou often saw'stA parent bless'd in Amarantha's bloom,Yet ripe in virtue. Her, presenting pray'rWith votive flow'rs before Minerva's shrine,
This very hour Barbarians have enthrall'd,Borne in my sight precipitate away.O wife lamented, gather'd in thy primeBy ruthless Pluto! in Elysian grovesHow shall I meet thee, and the tidings bearOf thy lost child, to servitude a prey,To violation doom'd? Yet more: the rageOf these invaders, who have spoil'd our fields,Defac'd our temples, driv'n to shelt'ring caves,To pathless cliffs, our populace dismay'd,Is now ascending to insult the fane,With sacrilegious violence to seizeTh' accumulated off'rings by the greatAnd good from age to age devoted there.He scarce had finish'd, when the earth beneathRock'd from her center in convulsive throes;From pole to pole th' ethereal concave groan'd:Night from her cavern with gigantic steps
Bestrode the region, lifting high as heav'nHer broad, infernal palm, whose umbrage hidesThe throne of light; while, glancing through the riftsOf her black mande, overlaid with clouds,Blue vapours trail'd their fires. The double headOf tall Parnassus reeling, from the cragUnloos'd two fragments; mountainous in bulk,They roll to Delphi with a crashing sound,Like thunder nigh whose burst of ruin strikesThe shatter'd ear with horror. Thus the bardUnmov'd, while round him ev'ry face is pale:Not on our heads these menaces are thrownBy ireful nature, and portentous heav'n;Th' unrighteous now, th' oppressor of mankind,The sacrilegious, in this awful hourAlone should feel dismay. My Delphian host,Who knows but thund'ring Jove's prophetic son
Now vindicates his altar; in his nameNow calls the turbid elements to war?What shrieks of terror fill thy native streets!The hills with barb'rous dissonance of cries,The caverns howl. Athenians, be prepar'd,Best so when arm'd: then, Timon, case thy limbs;The season teems with prodigy. SecureIn conscious virtue, let us calmly watchThe mighty birth. By heav'n! through yonder gateThe foes are driven; confusion, wild despair,With panic dread pursue them: friends, embraceTh' auspicious moment; lift your pious blades,Ye chosen men, auxiliars to a god!He spake, advancing with his holy friendTo battle. Shiv'ring at their own misdeed,At heav'n-inflicted punishment, the foesUnnerv'd, distracted, unresisting, deem'dThe warriors two celestials from above,
Cas'd in Vulcanian panoply, to wageThe war of gods. The whole Athenian trainIn equal fervour with Barbarian bloodDistain their weapons. So from forests drear,When barren winter binds the foodful earth,Enrag'd by famine, trooping wolves invadeA helpless village; unwithstood, they rangeWith greedy fangs, and dye with human goreThe snow-envelop'd ways. The Delphian race,By fear so lately to the neighb'ring hillsAnd caves restrain'd, forsake their shelt'ring holds;In clusters rushing on the foes dismay'd,Accomplish their defeat. Th' Athenian chiefTriumphant, red with massacre, admitsA Persian youth to mercy, who his shieldAnd sword surrenders. Persian, dost thou hopeThy flow'ring bloom shall ripen to enjoyA length of days? (severe his victor spake)Then to my questions utter words sincere.
Reveal thy name, thy father's. Where encampsThe host of Xerxes? Whither doth he pointHis inroad next? To violate this faneBy his appointment was thy youth compell'd?Last, if thou know'st, what impious savage toreThe Delphian maiden from Minerva's shrine?The Persian answers with a crimson'd cheek,With eyes in tears—Ah! little now availsTh' illustrious current of Argestes' bloodTo me a captive, less the name I bearOf Artamanes. By the king's decreeThat we were sent, that I unwilling came,Is truth sincere. Our leader slain, the heapsOf these disfigur'd carcases have madeTheir last atonement to th' insulted god.The king in rich Orchomenus I left;Who through Boeotia meditates to marchAgainst th' Athenians. He, alas! who seiz'd
The beauteous virgin at Minerva's shrine,He is my brother, eldest of the race,Far hence secure; while captive here I mournHis heinous outrage, and my own disgrace.Addressing Timon, here Cecropia's bard:Preserve this youth a hostage for thy child:He seems deserving; thee I know humane.Now to Apollo's temple be my guide.Still dost thou droop?—O Aeschylus, exclaimsDesponding Timon, from the woes begunThis day in Delphi, I to Athens traceA series black with evil. Lo! the wise,The righteous Aristides from your wallsThrough jealousy of merit is expell'd;Themistocles the cause. Himself, though great,Yet envious, and ambitious that his lightMay blaze unrivall'd, of th' Athenian stateExtinguishes the brightest. Sparta shews,
At this dread crisis, how the hearts of menBy selfish eares and falsehood are deprav'd.She to the land of Pelops still confinesHer efforts, on the neighb'ring isthmus rearsA partial bulwark, leaving half the Greeks,Your noble seat, this oracle, expos'dTo devastation: little she regardsOur god profan'd, our progeny enslav'd;Her chief Pausanias, arrogant and stern,O'erlooks my suff'rings. Feeling what I fearFor thee and others, I must droop, my friend.To him the bard, in these sententious strains:Not endless sunshine is the lot of man,Nor ever blooming seasons. Night succeedsThe day, as day the night: rude winter frowns,Fair summer smiles. Thus variable the mind,Not less than human fortune, feels the strifeOf truth and error, which alternate reign
The arbiters of nature. Dark the deed,A deed of gloomy night, when envy forc'dThe best Athenian from his natal roof:But light will soon return. Though Sparta breakHer promise pledg'd; though false Boeotia propA foreign throne; still Athens will sustainHerself and Greece, will retribution payTo Aristides, and her morn dispelThe mist of error with a glorious blaze.No more—my duty calls me to the fane.They move, and passing by Minerva's grove,Two monuments of terror see. There stopp'dThe massy fragments, from Parnassus rent:An act of nature, by some latent causeDisturb'd. Tremendous o'er Barbarian ranksThe ruins down the sacred way had roll'd,Leaving its surface horrible to sight;Such as might startle war's remorseless god,
And shake his heart of adamant. Not longThis blood-congealing spectacle detainsThe troop, which swiftly to the Pythian domePress their ascending steps. The martial bardFirst, as enjoin'd by holy form, to scenesFar diff'rent, sweet Castalia's fount and grove,Resorts, with pure ablution to redeemFrom dust and slaughter his polluted limbs,To holy eyes obscene. Beside the fane,Within a flow'ring bosom of the hill,Through veins of rock beneath embow'ring shade,The rills divine replenish, as they flow,A cavity of marble. O'er the brim,In slender sheets of liquid crystal, downThey fall harmonious. Plistus takes belowTo his smooth bed their tribute. Plunging thereIn deep obscurity of wood, whose roofWith ridgy verdure meets the low-bent eyeFrom that stupendous cliff, his current winds
Through shade awhile; thence issuing large in view,Refreshes grateful meads, by mountains edg'd,Which terminate on Cirrha, Delphian port.Beyond her walls blue Neptune spreads his faceFar as Achaia's wide expanse of coast,With tow'rs and cities crown'd. The marble fountOn either side is skirted thick by grovesOf ancient laurel with luxuriant arms,In glossy green attir'd. There Phoebus, prideOf Parian quarries, stands a form divine,In act to draw an arrow from the caseLoose hanging o'er his shoulder; and in lookSerene, but stern: his worshippers to guard,As if the Pythian serpent were in sight,He meditates the combat. Here disarm'd,His limbs from all th' impurities of MarsTh' Athenian purges. Menial care suppliesA garment silver-white: an olive branchHis suppliant hand sustains. He seeks the fane;
He mounts the steps magnificent: the gatesOn sounding hinges turn their brazen valves.Across an area vast, with solemn shadeOf massy columns border'd, slow he movesHis manly frame. Procumbent at the mouthOf that abyss oracular, whose fumeBreathes wild sensation through the Pythian maid,With hands outstretch'd, he offers up this pray'r:O vanquisher of Python! Seed of Jove,Whose eleutherian might the tyrant dreads!Bright pow'r of day, dispenser of that fireWhich kindles genius in the human breast!God of that light diffusing through the soulThe rays of truth and knowledge! Friend to man,His monitor prophetic! O admitAthenians, anxious for their country's weal,In this her day of peril to consultThy wisdom, thy protection to implore!Her tripod high the prophetess ascends:Enthusiastic motion strains her form,In flashes rolls her eyeballs, and bespreadsHer agitated front with floating hair.Her weight a laurel, planted nigh, upholds,Which she embraces; her convulsive graspShakes to the root the groaning trunk, the boughs,The clatt'ring foliage. Forth she bursts in foam.Fly, wretched men, to earth's extremest bound!I see, I see th' Acropolis in flames,Your temples crumble, and your turrets nod:I see the blood run sable through your streets.All unabash'd, the hero firm replies:Yet further speak. Though citadel and fanesBe doom'd to ashes, must the nation fall?If so, instruct thy suppliants how their fallMay prove most glorious in the sight of gods
And men.—The Pythian answers with a lookOf pity, soft'ning her tempestuous rage:Ah! still my tongue like adamant is hard.Minerva's tow'rs must perish: Jove severeSo wills; yet granting, at his daughter's suit,Her people refuge under walls of wood.But shun the myriads of terrific horse,Which on your fields an eastern Mars will range.She ceas'd; Th' Athenian notes her answer down:To one, the most entrusted of his train,He gives the tablet. Back to Athens fly,He said; the son of Neocles alone,By his unbounded faculties, can pierceThe hidden sense of these mysterious strains;All which of Xerxes thou hast heard, report:I must depart to Elis.—Must thou go?
Dejected Timon then: what safety hereFor me remains? Barbarians will return;My countrymen, dishearten'd as before,Resort to caverns. Though the god hath sav'dHis shrine, the rest of Phocis lies a prey,Boeotia, Locris, Doris, to the foe.Yet what have I, O Aeschylus! to dread?I have no other child for savage forceTo violate: In Amarantha lost,My joy, my hope are vanish'd; and the hand,Which lays me breathless, will befriend me best.Th' Athenian here: Unmanly is despair,A noxious weed, whose growth, my Delphian host,Let courage wither. Phoebus hath denounc'dThe waste of Athens. Hopeful I forebode,That prouder walls and battlements will liftTheir heads for ages; and that eye of GreeceWith inextinguishable ray surpass
Its former lustre. Quit this dang'rous place,With us embarking: borrow help from time,Safe counsellor to wisdom. You, the raceOf holy Delphi, should the foe return,Again dispersing to your caves, relyOn your protecting god. Not vers'd aloneIn holy rites, in arms and council tried,A chief like Timon fame forbids to hideHis dignity in caverns.—Timon here:Thou shalt conduct me, thou my friendly star!Meantime selected messengers I sendThe needful barks at Cirrha to prepare.Now from the temple under Timon's roofAdmitted, vig'rous with refection dueOf rest and food, to Cirrha they proceedWith Artamanes. Ready are the barks,The gale propitious, calm the wat'ry plain:
When, like the feather'd sojourners, who leaveTheir late abode on winter's bleak approach,To wing their flight for climates more benign,These with extended canvas quit the port,And, doubling round Achaia, cut the mainTo sacred Pisa. On their way the harpOf Aeschylus, preluding to the strainWhich on his banks Alpheus was to hear,Relieves the sailor toiling at his oar,Enchants the wind retentive of the soundsWhich harmonize his breath. If round the keelOf sweet Arion dolphins ever play'd,Or blithsome Nereids to the pleasing moodOf Orpheus danc'd, while Argo plough'd the deep;They now had felt controulment as in bonds,Not on their pliant, azure-glossy finsDisporting light, but rigid with amazeAt this majestic muse. Yet sounding verse,In solemn cadence to the deep-ton'd lyre,
Which could the boist'rous mariner subdue,The ear of Timon, languid by despair,Rejects, attentive to his grief alone,Which sighs within. Society is pain,Ev'n with his friend. A solitary couchHe seeks; recumbent, not reposing, thereConsumes the hours in pertinacious woe,Which sheds no tear. If wearied nature sinks,His sleep is troubled; visions of the nightAppal his spirit; starting, he forsakesA thorny pillow; rushes on the deckWith lamentations to the midnight moon.Alarm'd, th' Athenian chief approaching seiz'dOn Timon's hand; with earnest looks enquir'dWhy thus complaining he disturbs the calm,From his own pillow chacing due repose?Ah! I have seen my daughter, he replies,Have seen her twice!—Where seen her? all distress'd
Th' Athenian questions.—On a rock she stood,A naked rock, the parent wild exclaims;Unloos'd her zone, dishevell'd was her hair;The ravisher was nigh. On sight of me,Who no assistance from the shore could reach,O father, father! I am sham'd, deflower'd,But here will end my sorrows and disgrace;She said, and plung'd precipitate. I sawHer body swallow'd by the greedy surge,Unwept, depriv'd of sepulture, to float.Illusion all! the bard consoling spake;The phantom offspring of distemper'd sleep.A second time, the frantic fire pursues,Did Amarantha meet my aking sight;Then, like an eastern concubine attir'd,Her head was blazon'd with Barbaric gems;With golden gloss her wanton garment wav'd:
With her despoiler hand in hand she walk'd,Disclaim'd her father, and her father's gods.Oh then I wish'd her on the waves again,To parch in winds, or sate some vulture's beak!The youthful captive Artamanes, rous'd,Stands nigh in gen'rous tears. To him the bard:Ingenuous Persian, check thy tears, and lendThy hand benign: committed to his couchHim watch and fuccour.—Hourly was perform'dThe pious office; noblest Delphians roundAssist in tears; while now the moonlight twiceDanc'd on the billows. On the second mornThey land in Elis. Fame had gone before,Promulgating the valour which aveng'dThe Delphian god, prophetic light to man,Ev'n more than Jove in Ammon's Libyan shrineOr Dodonaean groves. A shining carWaits on the shore; a herald there salutes
The warrior bard. Divine Athenian, hail!Hail, righteous captain of a righteous band!These olive crowns to thee and them I bear;So have the sage Hellanodics ordain'd,Who to their just tribunal through my voiceInvite thy presence. Aeschylus receivesThe victor's chaplet, and ascends the car.Along Alphēus to th' Olympian listsHe passes through spectators all array'dIn garlands too, and num'rous like the flow'rsEmbellishing the river's fragrant sides,Or like the pebbles in his murm'ring bed.Th' approach of Aeschylus is known. BetweenTwo rows of victors in their olive crownsHe o'er the sanded area greets the thrones,Where, grac'd with scepters magisterial, satTh' Elēan judges. Standing on the car,To them, uprising from their seats, he spake:If to have fought for Delphi and her godDeserve this chaplet, what superior praiseTo him is due, who voluntary diedFor Lacedaemon? But he claims no moreThan emulation from the sons of Greece,Like him to save their countries and their laws.He hath his honours in the bless'd abodes;From him I come deputed; hear in meLeonidas. A vision, as of gods,To me, late slumb'ring on Ilissus, rose;In semblance rose Leonidas, begirtWith all the virtuous partners in his fate.Before me earth divided; through the cleftA gushing radiance dimm'd the eye of noon.In structure all of diamond, self-pois'd,Amid redundant light, a chariot hungTriumphal. Twelve transparent horses breath'dBeams from their nostrils, dancing beams of dayShook from their manes. In lineaments of man,
Chang'd to immortal, with a shape enlarg'd,A stature lengthen'd, there the mighty soulOf Sparta's king apparent shone. His woundsShot forth a starlike splendour. Round in carsTriumphal too arrang'd, the stately formsOf those whom virtue led to share his doom,And consecrate Thermopylae to fame.To me these words the glorious shape address'd:Go to the sage Hellanodics, the justElēan judges of Olympian palms:In that wide concourse celebrate my death.Let my example gen'ral Greece inspireTo face her danger; let the Spartan shieldProtect th' Athenians, else I died in vain.Attention mute th' Hellanodics command:The thick'ning crowd is hush'd. The bard proceeds,While inspiration swells his copious breast,Flames in his eye, and thunders from his voice.Parnassian Phoebus he invok'd, the pow'rOf prophecy and song. His aid is dueIn celebration of the man who heardThe oracle from Delphi, and obey'd."A king deriv'd from Hercules must die"For Lacedaemon." Who obedient heard?Leonidas: he left his household gods,His wife belov'd, his offspring; at the gateOf Greece, Thermopylae, he fought, he fell:With him what heroes? Alpheus, Maron bled,There Agis, there Dioneces, the seer,Megistias, bold Diomedon, the youthOf Dithyrambus, Thespia's hoary chief,Demophilus; for you they all expir'd:Rise, Greeks, revenge their fall! in that revengeYour laws, your manners, and religion save.You who aspire to these Olympic wreaths,The brightest guerdon to a Grecian brow,Yet will you linger, till Barbaric arms
Annihilate th' Olympiad? Not to dieLeonidas invites; no, Greeks, to live!Surmounting foes enervate by the dreadHis death impress'd, to fill your cup of lifeWith virtuous glory, to enjoy your hopesIn peace, in years and merit then matureBe his companions in eternal bliss.Such was the substance; but in swelling phraseAt large, full tide of poesy and zeal,Flow'd his high-ton'd, enthusiastic song.End of the First Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the SECOND.TH' inspiring measures close. To arms, to arms,Innumerable mouths concurrent sound;To arms, to arms, reply the pillar'd islesOf Jove's Olympian temple: down his banksTo distant Neptune glad Alphēus waftsThe glorious clamour. Through th' assembly vastMeantime an elevated form is seen,With gracious gesture, animating look,Approaching: now before th' Elean thrones
Of solemn judgment he majestic stands,Known for the man by Themis plac'd in rankAbove his fellow mortals; archon onceOf Athens, now an exile: him the chiefAmong the grave Hellanodics address'd:Hail, Aristides! On th' Olympian gamesThy presence throws new dignity: what crownCan they provide to equal thy desert?While others court the prize of strength and skill,Activity and valour; in the listsOf virtue only Aristides strives.With him on earth competitor is none;Him Jove, sole perfect judge of gods and men,Can recompense alone. He scornful viewsAmbitious heroes, who assume the namesOf thunder-bearers, vanquishers of towns,And ravagers of kingdoms: vain attemptIn feeble man to imitate in pow'r
Th' inimitable gods! On thee he castsAn eye delighted; thee, by ev'ry tongueProclaim'd the just; thee, emulating heav'n,Where mortals may, in goodness. Yet our voiceShall, what we can, decree dispraise to thoseWhose envy wrong'd that sacred head of thine.Forbear that censure, Aristides spake:Though liberty may err through jealous care,That jealous care far oft'ner saves a stateThan injures private worth. That I forgaveMy condemnation, be my witness, Jove!Whom I, departing from my native soil,Implor'd that Athens ne'er might feel the lossOf Aristides. To confirm that pray'rI have employ'd my exile; not in questOf splendid refuge in the courts of kings,But through each city with unwearied stepsHave pass'd, exhorting, stimulating Greece
To bold defence. I gladly am forestall'dHere by a noble countryman, whose armAt Marathon was fam'd, whose Attic laysImmortalize the brave. I now invoke,Not with less fervour, though in humbler phrase,The patriots there triumphant e'en in death,The manes of Leonidas, of allWhose gen'rous blood new-spilt in freedom's cause,Thermopylae beholds, to spread abroadTheir glorious spirit, and exalt your mindsAbove the sense of danger. Now the wealOf gen'ral Greece a gen'ral effort claims.March to the plain, ye Doric warriors! mountYour decks; th' Athenians with united armsSupport, no longer in that isthmian fenceYour trust reposing. Were the wall of brass,Were adamant the rampart, if the pow'rOf Athens, once extinguish'd, leave your coasts
Defenceless, soon to Pelops' Isle the foe,Like death, a thousand avenues will find.He ceas'd: A second acclamation rendsThe sky; again th' Olympian temple groansIn replication, and Alphēan banksReverberate the sound. The Attic bardMeantime, o'er-spent with labour of the mindAnd voice loud straining, to the tranquil porchOf Jove is lightly borne; nor knows the hands,Benevolent and pious, which sustainHis languid burden; till these friendly wordsIn tones remember'd dissipate his trance.Doth Aeschylus forget me? O recalMelissa's brother, and Oïleus' son,Whose Locrian hinds at one auspicious hourAssisted thy bold mariners to hurlTh' Oetaean ruins on Barbarian heads.
See Meliboeus off'ring to thy lipThe stream's refreshing moisture.—Soon restor'd,Th' Athenian thus: Illustrious Medon, hail!How fares Melissa, how thy native land?She rests, I hope, on Oeta still secure,Returns the Locrian. When Laconia's kingWas slain, and I, commanded to retreat,Charg'd with a solemn notice to her state,That he expir'd obedient to the laws;My life, devoted to avenge his blood,I sav'd. O'erpow'ring Xerxes soon reduc'dThe Locrians, Dorians, ev'ry northern Greek.In time my father's treasure I remov'd,Which with a hundred followers I boreTo Lacedaemon. There indiff'rence coldI found to all except of Pelops' Isle;Attention sole to build an isthmian wall:Pausanias, guardian to the minor king,
Son of divine Leonidas, disdainsOur just complaint: The Ephori confineTo this contracted region all their care,Save Aëmnestus. Gen'rous oft he mourn'd;In vain his torpid colleagues he reprov'd.Disgusted there, I join'd these solemn games,Where in contention of the warlike spearI prov'd a victor. Olive-bound, my headOn future fields its freedom shall maintain;Else, with my late preserver's fate in view,Shall dying roll this chaplet in the dust.Repair with me to Athens, cries the bard.Sage is that counsel, Aristides nearSubjoins: time presses; Aeschylus, embark:Aegina's hospitable round suppliesMy place of rest.—Now swift th' Athenian band,With Medon's, seek their Delphian barks again;While Aristides holds an inland course,
Still to his country meditating good,Of his own wrongs forgetful. As he roam'dFrom state to state, his eloquence instill'dThe love of freedom, horror at her loss,Unchanging hatred to monarchal sway,With concord, valour, fortitude, and zealFor Greece in danger. From his wonted seatIn heav'n, so Phoebus, patient and resign'd,An exile wander'd on the earth below;Beneficent and helpful, there diffus'dHis light of science; with salubrious skillImparted health, and taught the varied useOf lenient roots and plants. The Delphian keelsMeantime are loosen'd from Elēan sands,With sails outstretch'd for Athens. On his couchStill Timon lies despairing; near him watchThe chiefs humane: in kind officious careThe Persian captive from his forehead wipesThe dews of anguish. With a sudden startHim now the Delphian, erring, thus bespoke:Oh Alexander! thou hast lost, my son,Thy dear betroth'd, the land of Phocis lostHer noblest virgin! Reach my arms—I seeThe ravisher before me: though he frowns,Begirt with savage multitudes, my swordShall reach his barb'rous heart. Here Medon turnsTo Aeschylus: The sight of Delphi's chief,So nobly excellent, so honour'd, lov'd,By all resorting to consult his god,A sight once grateful, pierces now my soulWith agony. How oft hath music sooth'dDistemper'd bosoms! Let thy tuneful chords,Medicinally sweet, apply their aid.To him the bard: My harmony his earBut late rejected. Meliboeus, tryThe softer sounds which Pan hath taught the swains.A modulation by Melissa taughtI will essay, th' obedient swain replies.He said, and lightly touch'd his warbling flute.Like fountains rilling, or mellifluous notesOf birds, a soft and lulling flow attun'dThe ambient air. At first th' afflicted manPaus'd in attention, soon a trickling tearBedew'd his beard; the remedy was chang'dTo pain, and thus he recommenc'd his moan.Thou, Amarantha, too couldst wake the soulOf music, melting in thy parent's ear,Refining joyful seasons, or the hoursOf care beguiling. In a foreign climeHang up thy harp, sad captive! Let thy handForget her skill, nor charm Barbarian minds.But hark! I hear the ruffian. Slave! he calls,Resume thy harp: Some chosen hymn of Greece,Such as delighted Phoebus, chaunt to me,Me now thy god. O Alexander, fly,Redeem thy love. Apollo, who couldst hurl
Parnassian summits on a host of foes,Make me thy instrument of wrath! My nervesConvert to pierceless adamant; my lancePoint with thy father's lightning! Me thy priest,Sprung from an old, heroic, sacred line,Thou shouldst avenge. But vengeance is too late;My daughter yields: a minstrel to her lord,To her deflow'rer, with obsequious artThe Grecian chords she prostitutes, and smilesTo see my suff'rings!—During this distress,With canvas press'd, the squadron bounds alongBy Coryphasium, by Messene's gulphIn Nestor's Pylian kingdom, by the peakOf Taenarus, projecting o'er a cave,Night's gloomy chamber, fabled to descendLow as Plutonian regions. Thrice the mornSerenely smil'd, ere Malea's top their sailsO'ershades, Laconian promontory bleak,The residence of storms. Five distant masts
Are now descried; when Aeschylus bespakeThe Locrian chief: Not friendly are those decks;Our navy, since Thermopylae was forc'd,To Salamis retiring, leaves the foesAt large to range the sea. Thy counsel give;To some Laconian harbour shall we steer,Or wait their coming? Here Oïleus' son:Thou art my leader; thee propitious MarsOn land and main with equal pow'rs endues:How can I counsel, stranger to the waves?At thy commandment to retreat, or fight,Behold me ready.—Then by Mars, repliesThe warrior bard, as no resistless forceBears down against us, yet insulting hoistsA threat'ning signal, Delphians, rest the oar;Provide your arms; Athenians, Locrians, arm!This said, his pinnace, launch'd in haste, convey'dHis orders round to form th' embattled line.
Six were the vessels; Lo! a stately barkIn regal pendants leads th' opponent van.As when a vernal sun's precarious beamIs intercepted by a sudden cloud,Whose turgid folds are overcharg'd with hail;Some palace, broad, impenetrably roof'd,Defies the clatt'ring, ineffectual drift,Which harmless melts away—so flew a show'rOf missive arms, of arrows, javelins, darts,With pebbles whirling from the forceful sling,On Grecian helms and implicated shields;But innocently fell. Now side to sideThe chieftains grappled, and gigantic deathTo either deck outstretch'd his purple feet.Malignant art no engine hath devis'dTo man destructive like his own fell handIn serried fight. But slaughter now beganTo pause in wonder, while the Asian chief,Whose blazon'd armour beam'd with gold, engag'd
Cecropia's hardy vet'ran foot to foot,With falchion falchion, shield encount'ring shield.So, in the season when lascivious heatBurns in their veins, two branching-headed stags,Of all the herd competitors for sway,Long with entangled horns persist in strife,Nor yield, nor vanquish: stand in gaze the rest,Expecting which by conquest shall assumeThe mastery of all. Now Timon, rous'dWith Meliboeus, and the captive youth,Starts from his pillow: they attain the poop,Which instant boarded from an eastern shipBy hostile arms is held. Brave Medon quitsHis former station; Aeschylus he leavesA firm defender there: his falchion keenAloft he waves. As some tremendous shark,Who with voracious jaws resistless foamsAlong the main, and finny tribes devours,Or drives before him on the sun-bright waves,
Where late secure they wanton'd—Medon's might,Prevailing thus, the steerage heaps with dead;Though not in time victorious to retainUnhappy Timon, Meliboeus good,And Artamanes, not unwilling borneWith them away to join his friends again.Two Delphian vessels their auxiliar beaksPresent. More furious had the contest glow'dIn ev'ry quarter; when o'er Malean cliffsThe wind began to howl, the troubled skyTo flash sulphureous, menacing a storm,Such as Saturnia on the Dardan fleet,Or Neptune's rage for Polyphemus blindDash'd on Laërtes' much enduring son.The squadrons separate; To the shelt'ring leeOf Malea steer the Grecians; while their foesExpatiate o'er the roomy sea, to shunThe local tumults of that stormy shore,And hold a distant course. O'er Timon's fate
Th' Athenian now finds leisure to lamentWith Medon, Medon with responsive griefFor Meliboeus. By return of dawnThe waters calm'd invite the vigorous oarsTo recommence their progress. Coasting downLaconia's sea-beat verge, they wear the day;Then resting moor in Cynosura's port.From Aeschylus in sighs these accents broke:Here Aesculapius by his pow'rful art,Which dar'd revive departed breath in man,Offending Pluto, thunder-pierc'd by Jove,Lodg'd his own clay in Cynosura's mold.O now to immortality preferr'd,Kind god of med'cine! wouldst thou hear my suit,Thou shouldst restore Leonidas, to warmUnfeeling Sparta; then thy Delphian sireThe menac'd doom of Athens would revoke,Nor I besprinkle with indignant tears
Laconia's shore. O Locrian guest, I call'dThy welcome feet to Athens: thou mayst view(For so the oracle to me denounc'd)Her tow'rs in dust.—Minerva's tow'rs to fallHath Phoebus doom'd? the Locrian chief exclaim'd;I, who have lost my country, yet can findA tear for Athens: I attest the gods,As in one vessel, Aeschylus, we steerTogether now, thy fortune I will share;And down her stream, howe'er the tempest roar,With thee embark'd, will never quit thy side.The tragic bard unbends his mournful brow,Thus answ'ring: Gen'rous Medon, I confess,Approaching nearer to my seat of birth,I dropp'd a tear of anguish; nature weptAt sad forebodings of destruction there.But know, a true Athenian ne'er desponds:Abandon'd by allies, condemn'd by heav'n
To see their city burnt, that gallant raceWill yet assert their liberty; will saveEv'n faithless Sparta, and thy home redeem.This said, they slept, till morning gives her signTo weigh the anchors, and unfurl the sails.Aurora's third appearance tips with light,Of roseate tincture, spacious walls and tow'rsOf no ignoble city, rising clearFrom shading mists to view. The poet then:Lo! Medon, fair Troezene; rich her soil,Her people gen'rous, to Cecropia's stateInviolably faithful. See that isleWhich fronts the port; redundant in delightsOf art and nature, though of circuit small,Calauria shews her verdant round of wood.Here disembarking, with devotion pureWe must invoke the trident-bearing god.
This isle from Phoebus Neptune in exchangeFor Delphi took. Thrice holy is the soil,Deserving rev'rence, by that pow'r belov'd,Who shar'd a third of ancient Saturn's reign,His son a brother to Olympian Jove.Here shall we greet some wonder of her sex,The sacerdotal maid. Troezene's lawsOne of her noblest daughters in her budEstablish here presiding, here confin'dTo priestly functions, till the genial godOf marriage hence redeem her, grown matureFor care less rigid, and a tend'rer tie.The heroes land, where opening to their sightAn elevation of the ground, attir'dIn flow'r-enamell'd turf, display'd the faneOf structure vast in marble: brass the gatesRefulgence cast; a peristyle sustain'dThe massy roof; huge columns on their heads
The crisped foliage of acanthus bore,And high o'erlook'd th' impenetrable shadeWhich screen'd the island round. Perennial springsSupplied melodious currents through the woods,In artificial beds of pearly conchsAlong the sea-beat margin cull'd by nymphs,The temple's chaste attendants. Unrestrain'dHere flow'd the native waters; there confin'dBy marble fountains, win th' enchanted eyeTo shady-skirted lawns, to op'ning glades,Or canopies of verdure: all the fountsWere grac'd by guardian images of gods,The train of Neptune.—Lo! the gate is thrownAbroad; the priestess, lovely in her shapeAs virgin Thetis to the nuptial armsOf Peleus led, more blooming than the flow'rsBeneath her decent step, descends the slope:A matron staid behind her solemn treads;Close to her side, in radiant arms, a youth
Who like a brother of the Graces moves.His head, uncas'd, discovers auburn locksCurl'd thick, not flowing: his sustaining handShe, rosy-finger'd, to her own admits.He seem'd Apollo, not with martial firesSuch as on Titan's race he darted keen,But with th' enamour'd aspect which he woreWhen Clymene he won, or Daphne woo'd:She Cynthia, not a huntress, when the chaceOf rugged boars hath flush'd her eager cheek,But gently stooping from an argent cloud,Illumining mount Latmus, while she view'dHer lov'd Endymion, by her magic pow'rEntranc'd to slumber.—Aeschylus approach'd,To whom the youth: Great bard and warrior, hail!Whose valiant deeds on Artemisium's flood,In that first conflict with Barbarian fleets,I strove to copy: there was all my praise.Me Troezen's leader, from my post remote,
Thou see'st: forbear to wonder, and attend.Thy Athens now is desolate—relaxThat anxious brow—her constancy, her zealFor gen'ral freedom, elevate her nameBeyond all triumphs. Her discerning chief,Themistocles, interpreting the wordsOf Pythian Phoebus, prov'd that ships alone,The fleets of Athens, were the wooden wallsOf refuge. All persuaded, fires and sons,With mothers, daughters, cheerfully forsookTheir native roofs. Lo! Salamis o'erflowsWith your illustrious people; through her townsAegina swarms; to multitudes myselfHave been conductor; in Troezenian homes,By cordial invitation, they reside.To each a daily stipend by a lawThey find allotted, schools with teachers fill'd,That not unletter'd from Troezene's wallsThe sons of learned Athens may depart,
When victory to come rebuilds her tow'rs.With thee behold me ready to embarkFor Salamis again, where anchor'd liesThe whole confederated fleet. I leaveMy Ariphilia, this my dear betroth'd,To fight my country's battles; but return,I trust in Mars, more worthy of her love:To her and Neptune I but now consign'dThe most ennobled of Athenian dames.Ha! see on yonder beach the form divineOf Aristides, newly wafted o'erFrom Troezen: thither, not unbid, he cameFrom his late virtuous progress, in our boundsThrough willing minds sage counsel to diffuse,His own exterminated friends console.Cleander finish'd. Soon th' arrival knownOf Aristides from the temple call'dThe Attic dames, from ev'ry purlieu near,
Who with their children in assembly throngAround him. Silent tears confess his lossTo them and Athens. His benignant moldBy sympathy had melted into grief;If wisdom, ever present in his soul,Had not his long-tried constancy upheldTo their behoof. Environ'd by the troopOf lovely mourners, stood the godlike manLike some tall cedar, in a garden plac'dWhere glowing tufts of flow'rs and florid plantsOnce bloom'd around; now, sear'd by scorching blasts,In faded colours pine. In look, in phraseHumane he spake: Be comforted, and hearMy voice applaud Themistocles, my foe,Whose counsels have preserv'd you. But what praiseIs yours, O glories of the tender sex!Who brave the floods, without a murmur leaveYour native, dear abodes for public good!Ye ornaments of Greece, the pride and boastOf happy fathers, husbands, brothers, sons!As yet unseen, Euphemia from the restImpatient stepp'd, his mother. At her sight,The best, the greatest of mankind inclinesBefore the authress of his being, lowAs some celestial to the rev'rend formOf Cybele, progenitrix of gods.Her aged arms extending, she began:Thy moderation aggravates the crimeOf Athens. Son, remember, when thou bad'stOur household gods farewel, thy parting pray'r;That Athens never might regret the lossOf Aristides. Righteous man! then firstThe righteous pow'rs denied a pray'r of thine;Who with inflicted vengeance for thy wrongHave sorely taught Athenians to lamentIn thee their safety banish'd.—Mother, cease,He quick replied; controul presumptuous thoughts;Let such uncomfortable words no more
Be heard by these already plung'd in woe:It is Laconia, who her aid withholds,Cecropian tribes afflicts. But, noble dames,In this asylum sojourning a while,Trust your own merits, and a guardian god;The sons of Athens on his own domainHe will exalt by conquest, soon transportHer daughters back to liberty and peace:From him that grace continue to deserve,By resignation to his brother Jove,Who loves the patient.—As on lands adustBy hot solstitial rays, when genial clouds,In season due unbosoming their storesOf kindly rain, new dress the pasture brown;Again the flowrets on the meadows spring;O'er meadows, fresh in verdure, youthful steeds,Led by the parent females, joyous bound,The heifers gambol, kids and lambkins dance,The birds in dripping bow'rs their plumes repair,
And tune their choral, gratulating throats—So consolation from his blameless mouth,With looks benevolent, in soothing tonesRelieves dejection. Soft composure smoothsEach matron's forehead; virgins smile around;With sprightly feet the children beat the turf,Him as their father hail in shrill delight.Not so his own two daughters: infants young,A dying mother's pledge, Euphemia's charge,His side they leave not, clinging to his kneesLike woodbines sweet about some stately tree:He kiss'd, he bless'd them, but controul'd his tears.Now tow'rds the bay with Aeschylus he turns;Cleander follows. Ariphilia muteStands fix'd in tears; as Niobe, congeal'dBy grief to marble, through its oozing poresDistill'd sad moisture, trickling down unheard.On Sipylus the nymphs, by pity call'd,
The weeping rock environ'd; so the train,Who minister in Neptune's sacred dome,Inclose their priestess, whom her matron sageLeads from Cleander's oft reverted sight.End of the Second Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the THIRD.O'ER his own squadron soon Troezene's chiefHath reassum'd command; the rest embarkAboard the Delphian. Aeschylus then spake:To Salamis we hoist returning sails:Say, Aristides, shall my voice, of weightAmong the tribes, solicit thy recal?Our country wants that helpful hand of thine.No, Aristides answers, this againMight waken faction; let the monster sleep.
Themistocles directs united minds,In him confiding: not the stock reviv'dOf all Cecropia's heroes since her birth,Could like this union prop the Attic state.Brave too the son of Neocles, expert,Cool, politic; his talents will upholdThe public safety for his own renown.May he enjoy a glory so acquir'd!My secret counsels from Aegina's isleShall not be wanting: for my country's sake,Which I forgive, him, author of my wrongs,My utmost efforts shall advance to fame.The gulph Saronic now admits their keel.By Epidaurus coasting, they attainThe cape of high Spiraeum, which o'erlooksAegina. Guided by Aurora's light,Th' illustrious exile on that isle they land;Thence veering, steer for Salamis. These words
Now break from Medon; Silent have I gaz'dOn Aristides, shortly must beholdThemistocles; Athenian friend, explainBetween such men what cause produc'd their feuds.Their diff'rent merits, Aeschylus replied,Rais'd emulation in their younger days.A soldier's part they gallantly achiev'dIn the same rank at Marathon; I saw,Admir'd their valour. For distinction highIn pow'r and fame, Themistocles hath us'dHis num'rous virtues; Aristides walk'dIn virtuous paths, alone by virtue mov'd;For him his justice hath a title gain'dOf JUST. The son of Neocles, inflam'dBy envy, stirr'd the people's jealous fearAgainst his rival to assert a law,Where, by inscription of his name on shells,A citizen so potent, that his will
Seems only wanting to subvert the state,Is by concurrence of six thousand handsDoom'd for ten years to absence from their bounds,Without disgrace or mulct. Among the tribesThemistocles hath since obtain'd a swayWhich might incur the rigour of that law;Yet by the gods his influence supremeHe at this crisis gallantly employsTo save the public.—Lift thy wond'ring eyes!The whole confederated fleet of Greece,Four hundred gallies, bulwark all the roundOf Salamis: one animated massThat island shews; from swarms of either sex,And ev'ry age, dales, hillocks seem to heaveWith undulating motion.—His discourseClos'd with his voyage: on the furrow'd sandsOf Salamis the vessels rest their keels;Where living waters from a copious springDischarge their bubbling current. On a smooth,
But gently-shelving green, pavilions rose;One from the rest sequester'd, under shadeOf oaks above, was neighbour to the faneOf Telamonian Ajax, hero knownAt Troy: the Attic phalanx then he join'd,By Athens honour'd since with rites divine.This tent, by ensigns of command in frontAdorn'd, Themistocles possess'd: aloneHe now remain'd; artificer sublimeOf great expedients, in the greatest stormsWhich rock a state, he, politic and firm,In manly strife with fortune when she frown'd,Whene'er she smil'd her favour to secure—He now, to feed his enterprising soul,Successes past enumerating sat,Thus in a glow of thought: While others dream'dOf rest and safety permanent in Greece,I from the day of Marathon presag'd
The war begun, not finish'd; I, in time,Exhorted Athens to construct her fleet,A destin'd refuge; for the sail and oar,The shrouds and rudder, I her lusty youthPrepar'd; ere yet the Hellespont was bridg'd,I cur'd intestine feuds distracting Greece;When fate remov'd Leonidas from earth,My penetration, fathoming the depthsOf ocean, like futurity foresawLaconia's sloth; yet undismay'd I form'dThe mighty plan to save th' Athenian stateBy yielding Athens to Barbarian flames.That I might plead the mandates of a god,I won, by secret gifts, the Pythian maidAn oracle to render, which I fram'd;Th' interpretation to enforce, that shipsWere wooden walls, Minerva's priest I gain'dAmong the people to imprint beliefBy feign'd portents, and all religion's craft,
That to the sea their deity was fled,Th' Acropolis deserting. Thus at willThis restive, fierce democracy I swayFor their salvation, and my own behoofIn pow'r and lustre .... Interrupting hereHis eagle vanity in lofty soar,The warrior-poet and Oïleus' sonAppear. Serene and vacant he descendsAt once to affability and ease;As from his airy tow'r the lark, who strikesHeav'n's highest concave with his matin trill,His pinions shuts, and tranquil drops to earth.Of Aristides Aeschylus he knewThe friend approv'd; him courteous he salutes:Thy eloquence and arms, the gen'rous toilsOf Aristides too, have reach'd my earBy late intelligence. Thus far at leastYou have prevail'd; this navy is enlarg'd
By squadrons new from various Grecian states.Is not this Medon? Honour'd in thy sire,More in thy own deservings, my embraceAccept; accept the welcome of this tent.Myronides now joins him, mighty chief!The destin'd scourge of Thebes; Xanthippus, soonAt Mycale to conquer; in his handYoung Pericles, that future star of Greece;Then Cimon, fated on the land and mainTo gather palms in one triumphant day;Subaltern warriors to the prudent sonOf Neocles. Saluting these, he spake:My gallant fellow-citizens, you comeTo learn the issue of this day's debateIn gen'ral council. Wisely did we cedeTo Spartan Eurybiades command;The diff'rent squadrons to their native ports
Had else deserted. Irksome, I confess,This acquiescence; but occasion looksDisdainful back on him who lets her pass;You have embrac'd her. Yielding to the Greeks,You fix their station here, the num'rous foeIn narrow streights between Psyttalia's isleAnd Salamis to face. Can he possess,Who sees a treasure scatter'd on the ground,Unless he stoop? So prostrate in your sightLies Greece, that precious treasure. Can you ruleBefore you save? On union safety grows.Resigning now an empty name of pow'r,Your moderation, winning grateful states,Will to your own a real sway procureOf long duration. Lacedaemon's pride,Her best allies abandoning—a forceOf ten weak vessels sparing to a fleet,Where Attic hands unfurl two hundred sails—Shall pay hereafter retribution full
To you, Athenians, out of ashes rais'dFrom her to wrest ascendancy in Greece.Not sweetest music lulls the melting soulBeyond his artful eloquence, which soothesTheir warm, their injur'd virtue. They reply:To thee, not Sparta, cheerful we submit,Our leader sole; thou judge and act for all.Now to his frugal Attic meal they sat;Where Aeschylus and Medon, each in turnUnfolding amply his adventures, wonAttention: pleasing information charm'dDeluded time, till midnight prompted sleep.Thus, after labours past, the martial bardHis countrymen rejoin'd. The hostile ships,Which gave him battle under Malea's cape,
Veer'd for the streights Euboean, where the fleetOf Asia moor'd. Subsiding on their way,The wind grants leisure for the Persian chiefTo view the captives. Artamanes stepsBefore the rest: on sight of Caria's queen,Great Artemisia, who commanded there,His cheek, with recollection of his sireTo her so late perfidious, reddens warm.She first to him: Argestes could beholdMe worsted, long resisting adverse fateOn fam'd Thermopylae's disastrous field;My danger he enjoy'd: his rescued son,Whose growing merit wins observant eyes,I see with gladness; welcome to my deck!But who is he, disconsolate in mien?O rev'rend man of sorrows, lift thy head!From Artemisia no dishonour fear.He makes no answer—Artamanes, speak.The youth replies: His name is Timon, chiefAnd priest in Delphi; on our inroad there,My brother, Mithridates, snatch'd awayFrom his paternal breast a noble maid,An only child. His mind is darken'd sinceBy frenzy; my compassion his distressHath ever tended, fervent now imploresThou wouldst commit him to my grateful care:Myself am debtor to indulgent Greeks.In smiles the princess answer'd: Gen'rous youth!Couldst thou protect him, I would trust thy care;But those deform'd by ignominious deedsMay exercise in malice stronger pow'rThan thou in goodness: for the present layTh' unhappy Delphian on a bed of rest.Beside her waits Aronces, high in trust,A hoary senior, freedman of her sire.
On Meliboeus, on the queen, he fix'dAlternate looks; then earnest him address'd:O thou of noble frame, in lowly garb,Speak whence thou com'st, thy own, thy father's name.What region gave thee birth? Did nature print,Or some disaster, on thy cheek that mark?I am not curious from a slender cause.The swain replied: From nature I deriveThat mark; of parents, of my native seat,Within this breast no traces now survive;In childhood stol'n by pirates, I was sold(Heav'n there was gracious) to the best of men:Full thirty annual suns have since elaps'd.He oft appris'd me, that my infant lipsIn Grecian accents would repeat the namesOf Lygdamis and Dirce; so I styl'dMy sire and mother.—O imperial dame,
Thyself the seed of Lygdamis, exclaim'dThe ancient man. If circumstance be proof,He is thy brother, Haliartus, stol'nWithin that period from thy father's tow'rWash'd by the waves, that fair abode retir'd.Halicarnassus mourn'd the dire event.He is thy likeness. I, preferr'd to ruleThy father's household; I, whose faithful armsSo oft the infant Haliartus bore,So oft with eyes delighted have perus'dThat object dear, I never can forgetThat signal mark, coeval with his birth,Distinguishing thy brother.—Pensive, mute,Uncertain rests the queen.—He still proceeds:Behold thy son, Leander, melts in tears!It is the touch of nature hath unclos'dThat tender spring.—To him the regal dame:Old man, thou know'st I honour, I consideIn thy untainted faith. All strange events,Dress'd in affecting circumstance, exciteThese soft emotions; such in ev'ry breastShould rise, but not decide. Pure truth is builtNot on our passions; reason is her base.Him to accept my brother, needs more proof;But to his manly and ingenuous looksI render homage. Let him case his limbs.In Carian steel, and combat near my side;Let deeds illustrate an exalted mind;Then, whether kin or alien to my blood,He like a brother shall obtain regardFrom Artemisia.—Meliboeus here:Endear'd to heroes of Oïlean race,I claim with none alliance; I have liv'dWith them in joy, from ignorance been rais'dBy them to knowledge, from the lowly state
Which heav'n's deciding providence ordain'd,To their deserv'd regard, my utmost wish.To them restore me; I request no moreFrom deities or mortals. Case my limbsIn Carian armour splendid as thy own,Ne'er shalt thou see me combat near thy sideAgainst the Grecians. Place of birth, or bloodOf noblest dye in kindred, quite estrang'dBy time and fortune, I reject for Greece;Greece, my kind nurse, the guardian of my youth,Who for my tutors did her heroes lend.My dear affections all are center'd there,My gratitude, my duty.—By the handShe grasps the gallant captive, and proceeds:Thy sentiments are noble, they bespeakThe care of heroes; thy release my hopesForbid, my tend'rest wishes; to constrainThy presence here, while we assail thy friends,
I scorn. Aronces, launch a nimble skiff;On him attendant, reach Nicaea's walls,For him transport a suit of arms compelete;Nor let unhappy Timon want thy care.Thee, Greek or Carian, brother, friend, or soe,Whate'er thou prov'st hereafter, I will greetAgain, my heart so prompts me; I requireNo plighted word, no token; ere we meetOnce more at least, thou wilt not, I confide,Thou canst not harbour such a thought as flightFrom Artemisia.—Meliboeus look'dIntegrity; he felt too full for words,And sees her thoughtful and perplex'd retire.Aronces now on Artamanes calls;With him, and either captive, he embarks;Of Carian arms he lodges on the poopA rich-emblazon'd suit. The pinnace lightAlong the shore, from ev'ry foe secure,
Skims o'er the waters with distended sails,Swift as a vig'rous stag who hears no cryOf dogs or men, but o'er the champaign greenOr valley sweeps, to glory in his speedAnd branching antlers. On the form and portOf Meliboeus long Aronces fedHis eager eye, unsated with delight;At last he spake: My lord, Nicaea's fort,A garrison of Xerxes, will affordA refuge kind, till Caria's queen her sailOf visitation hoists; the setting sunWill see my lord safe landed in the cove.That splendid title thou dost ill bestowOn my condition, Meliboeus then.To whom Aronces: Oh thou art my lord,Thou art the son of Lygdamis! My heart,Old as I am, experienc'd in events,
Without a cause to such excess of joyWould ne'er mislead me.—Honest hearts, rejoin'dThe other, oft are credulous, and leadThe mind to error; art thou sure, my friend,That I am no impostor, who hath heardOf Lygdamis and Dyrce, and applyTheir names to falsehood?—Haliartus, no!Exclaims Aronces; I before me seeMy noble master, Lygdamis, restor'd;Such as he was when thou, his child, was lost.Oh! lend attention—lo! the winds are still,The sea unruffled, while my tongue beginsA tale which once with horror pierc'd my soul,ut in thy hearing rapt'rous I repeat:Halicarnassus gave thy father birth,Her most illustrious citizen; with twinsThy mother's bed was bless'd; thy sister one,That Artemisia, glory of her sex,
Bestow'd in marriage on the Carian king;Thou art the other. Oft thy sire abodeWithin a tow'r delightful, but remote,Wash'd by the billows; one disastrous day,As thou wast tripping on the silver sands,Thy nurse attending with some faithful slaves,A troop of pirates landed; all thy trainDefending thee were kill'd, or wounded sunkDisabled on the beach; with various spoil,From those unguarded borders, they convey'dAboard their vessels thee their richest prize.Aronces paus'd.—From Timon, listing by,This exclamation broke: My daughter tooMay be recover'd!—Artamanes here:Myself, redeem'd from capture, pledge my faithThat I will struggle to restore thy child.Night dropp'd her dusky veil; the pinnace gain'dNicaea, Locrian fortress, seated nighThermopylae; ensuing morn proclaims,By shouts and clangour, an approaching host.That gate of Greece, by Lacedaemon's kingSo well maintain'd, defenceless now admitsUncheck'd Barbarian inroads: thus a moundBy art constructed to restrain the sea,Or some huge river's course, neglected long,And unsustain'd by vigilance and care,Affords a passage new to whelming floods,Whose surface hides fertility in waste;Till some sagacious architect opposeTo nature's violence a skill divine,Prescribing where th' obedient wave shall flow.To his companions Artamanes spake,As in their sight, extended from a tow'r,Thermopylae in torrents from its mouth
Pours mingled nations: See Mardonius there,The son of Gobryas, author of this war,The flow'r of Asia's captains. At the timeWe first attack'd this pass, with num'rous bands,A distant range of Macedon and ThraceHe was detach'd to ravage and subdue,Triumphant now returning. Friends, farewel!Him I must follow. Timon, may the lightOf Mithra shine propitious on m daysAs I protect thy daughter, and restore,If fate so wills, her spotless to thy arms.These words, relumining with hope, compos'dThe clouded soul of Timon. Swift the youth,In vigour issuing through the portal, mix'dAmong his native friends: a blithsome steer,At op'ning dawn deliver'd from the stall,Thus o'er the flow'ry pasture bounding, joinsThe well-known herd. Mardonius him receiv'd,Foe to Argestes, cordial to his son,
Mardonius all-commanding, all in frame,In nervous limbs excelling, like that bullWho stemm'd the billows with his brawny chest,Who on his back of silver whiteness boreEuropa's precious weight to Cretan strands,Himself a god transform'd. New martial pow'rsAre here from Haemus, from Pangaean snows.A Greek in lineage, Alexander here,Young sov'reign o'er Barbarians, leads to warHis Macedonian troops. To Athens boundBy mutual hospitality, he lov'dThat gen'rous city; now, by force compell'd,He arms against her. But persuasive love,The charms and virtues of a Grecian fair,Will wake remembrance of his Grecian race,To better counsels turn his youthful mind.That Asia's king was now advanc'd to Thebes,Intelligence is brought; this known, a steedOf swiftest pace Mardonius mounts; command
To Tiridates delegates—Thy forceExtend o'er Locris, o'er the Phocian bounds,Our conquests new. This giv'n in charge, he speeds,With no companion but Argestes' son,Nor other guard than fifty horsemen light,To greet the king. The second morning shewsCadmean Thebes, whose citadel was rais'dBy stones descending from Cithaeron's hillSpontaneous, feign'd in fables to assumeA due arrangement in their mural bedAt sweet Amphion's lute; but truth records,That savage breasts by eloquence he tam'd,By his instructions humaniz'd, they feltThe harmony of laws and social ties.To him succeeded stern Agenor's son,Phoenician Cadmus, he who letters broughtFrom Tyre to Greece; yet ignorance o'erwhelm'dHis generation; barbarous of heart,Obtuse of mind they grew; the suries there,
There parricide and incest reign'd of old,Impiety and horror: more debas'd,They now for gold their liberty exchange;They court a tyrant, whose Barbaric hostFlames round their bulwarks, harrows up their plain,Lays waste their plenty, drinks Asopus dry,Their swift Ismenus, and Dircaean spring.End of the Third Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the FOURTH.THE Persian host in readiness was heldEre dawn; Aurora sees the signal given;Now trumpets, clarions, timbrels mix their sounds;Harsh dissonance of accents, in the shoutsOf nations gather'd from a hundred realms,Distract the sky. The king his march renewsIn all his state, collected to descendPrecipitate on Athens; like the birdOf Jove, who rising to the utmost soarOf his strong pinions, on the prey beneath
Directs his pond'rous fall. Five thousand horse,Caparison'd in streak'd or spotted skinsOf tygers, pards, and panthers, form'd the van;In quilted vests of cotton, azure dyed,With silver spangles deck'd, the tawny youthOf Indus rode; white quivers loosely cross'dTheir shoulders; not ungraceful in their handsWere bows of glist'ning cane; the ostrich lentHis snowy plumage to the tissued goldWhich bound their temples. Next a thousand steedsOf sable hue on argent trappings boreA thousand Persians, all select; in gold,Shap'd as pomegranates, rose their steely pointsAbove the truncheons; gilded were the shields,Of silver'd scales the corselets; wrought with gemsOf price, high-plum'd tiaras danc'd in light.In equal number, in resembling guise,A squadron follow'd; save their mail was gold,And thick with beryls edg'd their silver shields.In order next the Magi solemn trod.Pre-eminent was Mirzes; snowy whiteTheir vestments flow'd, majestically pure,Rejecting splendour; hymning as they mov'd,They sung of Cyrus, glorious in his ruleO'er Sardis rich, and Babylon the proud;Cambyses victor of Aegyptian Nile,Darius fortune-thron'd; but flatt'ry tun'dTheir swelling voice to magnify his son,The living monarch, whose stupendous pilesCombin'd the Orient and Hesperian worlds,Who pierc'd mount Athos, and o'erpower'd in fightLeonidas of Sparta. Then succeedTen coursers whiter than their native snowsOn wintry Media's fields; Nicaean breed,In shape to want no trappings, none they woreTo veil their beauty; docile they by chordsOf silk were led, the consecrated steedsOf Horomazes. Sacred too a car,
Constructed new of spoils from Grecian fanes,In splendour dazzling as the noontide throneOf cloudless Mithra, follow'd; link'd in reins,In traces brilliant overlaid with gems,Eight horses more of that surpassing raceThe precious burden drew; the drivers walk'd,None might ascend th' inviolable seat;On either side five hundred nobles march'dUncover'd. Now th' imperial standard wav'd;Of Sanders wood the pedestal, inscrib'dWith characters of magic, which the charmsOf Indian wizards wrought in orient pearl,Vain talisman of safety, was upheldBy twelve illustrious youths of Persian blood.Then came the king; in majesty of form,In beauty first of men, as first in pow'r,Contemplating the glory from his throneDiffus'd to millions round, himself he deem'dNot less than Mithra who illumes the world.
The sons of satraps with inverted spearsHis chariot wheels attend; in state their sires,The potentates of Asia, rode behind;Mardonius absent, of the gorgeous trainArgestes tower'd the foremost; following march'dA square battalion of a thousand spears,By Mithridates led, his eldest born;Him the lascivious father had depriv'dOf Amarantha; dangerous the flamesOf vengeance darted from his youthful eye.Th' immortal guard succeeded; in their vanMasistius, paragon of Asia's peers,In beauteous figure second to the king,Among the brave pre-eminent, more goodThan brave or beauteous; to Mardonius dear,His counsellor and friend, in Xerxes' courtLeft by that gen'ral, while in Thrace remote,To counterpoise Argestes. Tried in arms,In manners soft, though fearless on the plain,
Of tend'rest feelings, Mindarus, to loveA destin'd captive, near Masistius rank'd;Ariobarzanes next, whose barb'rous mienExemplified his fierceness. Last of horse,With Midias, pow'rful satrap, at their head,A chosen myriad clos'd the long array.From these were kept three hundred paces void;Promiscuous nations held their distant marchBeyond that limit; numberless they roll'd,In tumult like the fluctuating sands,Disturb'd and buoyant on the whirling breathOf hurricanes, which rend the Libyan wastes.To Thebes descending, soon Mardonius learn'dThat pioneers, with multitudes light-arm'd,Detach'd before the army, bent their courseTo Athens. On he speeds, rejecting food,Disdaining rest; till midnight Cynthia shewsA vaulted hollow in a mountain's side;
There in his clanging arms Mardonius throwsHis limbs for slight refreshment; by him liesArgestes' son; to pasture springing nigh,The troop dismiss'd their steeds, and slept around.To superstition prone from early ageWas Gobryas' son; o'erheated now by toil,Yet more by thirst unsated of renown,His soul partakes not with her wearied clayIn sleep repose; the cavern to her viewAppears in vast dimension to enlarge,The sides retire, th' ascending roof expands,All chang'd to crystal, where pellucid wallsExpose to sight the universe around.Thus did a dream invade the mighty breastOf that long matchless conqueror, who gaveItalia's clime a spoil to Punic Mars,When on the margin of Iberus layThe slumb'ring chief, and eagerly to birth
The vast conception of his pregnant mindWas struggling. Now Mardonius to himselfSeems roving o'er the metamorphos'd cave;Orbicular above, an op'ning broadAdmits a flood of light, and gentlest breathOf odorif'rous winds; amid the blaze,Full on the center of a pavement, spreadBeyond whate'er portentous Aegypt sawIn Thebes or Memphis, Fame, presiding there,Gigantic shape, an amethyst entire,Sits on a throne of adamant. On strengthOf pillars, each a topaz, leans the dome;The silver pavement's intervening spaceBetween the circling colonnade and wallWith pedestals of diamond is fill'd;The crystal circuit is comparted allIn niches verg'd with rubies. From that sceneThe gloom of night for ever to expel,Imagination's wanton skill in chains
Of pearl throughout the visionary hallSuspends carbuncles, gems of native light,Emitting splendour, such as tales portray,Where Fancy, winning sorceress, deludesTh' enchanted mind, rejecting reason's clue,To wander wild through fiction's pleasing maze.The oriental hero in his dreamFeels wonder waking; at his presence lifePervades the statue; Fame, slow-rising, soundsHer trumpet loud; a hundred golden gatesSpontaneous fly abroad; the shapes divine,In ev'ry age, in ev'ry climate sprung,Of all the worthies since recorded time,Ascend the lucid hall. Again she soundsA measure sweeter than the Dorian fluteOf Pan, or lyre of Phoebus; each assumesHis place allotted, there transform'd is fix'dAn adamantine statue; yet unfill'dOne niche remains. To Asia's gazing chief
The goddess then: That vacancy for thee,Illustrious son of Gobryas, I reserve.He thus exults: Bright being, dost thou grantTo Persia triumphs through my conqu'ring spear.He said: that moment through the sever'd earthShe sinks; the spacious fabric is dissolv'd;When he, upstarting in the narrow cave,Delivers quiek these accents: Be renownMy lot! O Fortune, unconcern'd I leaveThe rest to thee. Thus dauntless, ere his sleepWas quite dispers'd; but waken'd soon he feelsTh' imperfect vision heavy on his mindIn dubious gloom; then lightly with his footMoves Artamanes; up he springs; the troopPrepare the steeds; all mount; Aurora dawns.The swift forerunners of th' imperial campEre long Mardonius joins, where Athens-lifts
Her tow'rs in prospect. Unexpected seen,Their mighty chief with gen'ral, cordial shoutsThey greet; their multitude, their transport, clearHis heart from trouble. Soon Barbarian throngsWith shading standards through Cephissus wade,Who, had his fam'd divinity been true,His shallow stream in torrents would have swolnA while, to save the capital of Greece,Superb in structure, long-disputed prizeBetween Minerva and the god of seas,Of eloquence the parent, source of arts,Fair seat of freedom! Open are the gases,The dwellings mute, all desolate the streets,Save that domestic animals forlorn,In cries awak'ning pity, seem to callTheir masters home; while shrieking beaks of prey,Or birds obscene of night with heavy wings,The melancholy solitude affright.Is this the city whose presumption dar'dInvade the lord of Asia? sternly saidMardonius ent'ring; whither now are fledTh' audacious train, whose firebrands Sardis felt?Where'er you lurk, Athenians, if in sight,Soon shall you view your citadel in flames;Or, if retreated to a distant land,No distant land of refuge shall you findAgainst avenging Xerxes: yet I swearBy Horomazes, if thy gallant raceHave sacrific'd their country to contendWith mightier efforts on a future day,Them I will honour, though by honour forc'dI must destroy. Companions, now advance;Unnumber'd hands to overturn these wallsEmploy; not Xerxes through a common gateShall enter Athens; lay the ruins smooth,That this offending city may admit,
In all his state, her master with his hostIn full array. His order is obey'd.Through smooth Ismenus, and Asopus clear,The royal host in slow procession led,Their first encampment on a district lodge,Plataea's neighbour; that renown'd abodeOf noblest Greeks was desert. In his tentThe king by night requested audience grantsTo Leontiades, that colleague baseOf Anaxander, traitor like himselfTo Sparta's hero. Xerxes thus he warns:Now be the king reminded of the rageAgainst his father, which Plataea boreAt Marathon; that recently she brav'dHimself in Oeta's pass; nor Thespia foughtWith less distinguish'd rancour: be inform'd,The first is near, the other not remote;Thy vengeance both deserve. Destroy their fields,
Consume their dwellings; thy o'erflowing campMay spare a large detachment; I will goTheir willing guide. Masistius present spake:O monarch, live for ever in the heartsOf conquer'd nations, as of subjects born;Associate clemency with pow'r, and allMust yield obedience: thou art master here,Treat thy new vassals kindly.—In a frownArgestes: Shall the king with kindness treatInvet'rate foes and zealous friends alike?Shall undeserving Thespians, shall the raceOf fell Plataea, unprovok'd who stain'd,On Attic fields, her spear with Persian blood,To help detested Athens, shall they shareThe clemency of Xerxes, in despiteOf this our Theban host, who faithful givesSuch wholesome counsel? Sov'reign, when I broughtThy condescension late to Sparta's king,
Among the grim assembly in his tentDiomedon, Demophilus, I saw,With Dithyrambus, men preferring deathTo amity with thee, commanders allOf these malignant cities.—Xerxes here:Approving, Leontiades, thy wordsI hear; Masistius, thee my servant loves,Mardonius, always victor in my name;Yet learn at last, O satrap! who dost wearThe fullest honours, to partake with me,What I inherit from Darius, hateInflexible, inexpiable hateTo Athens, hate to her confed'rates all.Go, Theban, chuse what nations of our hostThou dost prefer; thyself appoint their chief.I chuse the Caspians, Sacians; name for chiefBrave Mithridates, great Argestes' heir,
Rejoins the traitor. These ferocious mostHe best approv'd, and Mithridates chose,Among the youth most vigorous and fellIn acts of blood. To hear Mardonius prais'd,Argestes, dreading his return, conceiv'dA pain, yet temper'd by a secret joyHe felt arise; who, rival of his son,Long wish'd him distant from the guarded roofWhere Timon's daughter was confin'd. Dismiss'dTo rest, all separate. They renew their marchBy day-spring; Leontiades, to wreakOn hapless Thespia and Plataea's wallsThe hate implacable of Thebes; the king,With equal rage, to spoil Minerva's reign.Her olive groves now Attica disclos'd,The fields where Ceres first her gifts bestow'd,The rocks whose marble crevices the beesWith sweetness stor'd; unparallel'd in art
Rose structures, growing on the stranger's eye,Where'er it roam'd delighted. On like Death,From his pale courser scatt'ring waste around,The regal homicide of nations pass'd,Unchaining all the furies of revengeOn this devoted country. Near the banksOf desolate Cephissus halting satThe king; retarding night's affrighted steeds,The conflagration wide of crumbling tow'rs,Of ruin'd temples, of the crackling groves,Of villages and towns, he thence enjoy'd,Thence on the manes of Darius call'd:Son of Hystaspes! if the dead can hear,Thou didst command thy servants to remindThy anger daily of th' Athenian race,Who insolently plough'd the eastern waves,Thy shores affronted with their hostile beaks,And burnt thy town of Sardis; at my call,
Ghost of my father! lift thy awful brow;Rememb'ring now th' Athenians, see thy sonOn their presumptuous heads retaliate flames:Depriv'd of burial, shall their bodies leavePale spectres here to wail their city fall'n,And wander through its ruins.—Closing hereHis barb'rous lips, the tyrant sought his couch.Thy summits now, Pentelicus, and thine,Haunt of sonorous bees, Hymettus sweet!Are ting'd with orient light. The Persian hostRenew their progress; Athens soon receivesTheir floating banners and extended ranksSmooth o'er the fosse, by mural ruins fill'd.As from a course of ravage, in her denOf high Cithaeron plung'd the monster SphinxHer multifarious form, preparing stillFor havoc new her fangs and talons dire;Till her enigma Laius' son resolv'd,Whence desperation cast her headlong down
The rocky steep; so, after thy careerOf devastation, Xerxes, rest awhileSecure in Athens, meditating thereFresh woes to men. Than Oedipus more wise,Th' interpreter of oracles is nigh;Soon will the son of Neocles expelThee from thy hold, by policy too deepFor thy barbarian council to explore.Before the Prytanaeum stops the car.Now savage bands inclose that rev'rend seatOf judgment; there Mardonius waits. The king,Pleas'd with his care, salutes him: Thou hast longSweat under harness in th' eternal snowsOf Macedon and Thracia, hast my nameThere dress'd in ample trophies; but thy speed,Preventing my arrival, is unknownTo wings of eagles, or the feet of stags.Mardonius answers: Ever live the kingTo find his servants zeal outstrip in speedThe swiftest eagle, or the fleetest stag!Descend, thou lord of Athens! destin'd soonTo universal sway.—They climb the steps;Alone Argestes follows. In the hallThese words of high import Mardonius spake:My liege, the season calls for quick resolves;By thee entrusted with supreme command,When thou art absent, to Phaleron's port,Late arsenal of Athens, all the shipsI order'd from Euboea; they belowLie well equipp'd and shelter'd, nor remoteThe whole united armament of GreeceAt Salamis. With Ariabignes great,Thy royal brother, and for merit nam'dThy ruling admiral, the kings of Tyre,Of Sidon, Caria's princess, and the rest,
I held a council; they concurr'd to fight,And by one effort terminate the war,All but the queen, from whose ingenuous mouthWill I, though differing, faithfully relateEach argument, each word—'Mardonius, tell'The king,' she said, 'what peril I foresee'From this attempt; his ships defeated leave'His host endanger'd; ever bold, the Greeks'Are desp'rate now; the want of sustenance'Will soon disperse them to their sev'ral homes;'The sea's entire dominion to the king'Will then be left; whole armies then embark'd'Through inlets free may pour on Pelops' Isle,'Whose coast I newly have explor'd with care.'Mardonius, thou art eager; do not trust'In multitude; full many in the fleet'Are false, are cowards. Let our sov'reign shun'Precipitation; short delay at least'Is safe; a naval combat lost, is bane.'A greater bane delay, Argestes here;Who reading artful in the royal eyeDetermination for a naval fight,His malice thus on Artemisia vents:My liege forgets that Caria's queen derivesHer blood from Grecian fountains; is it strangeShe should confine thy formidable hand,And so preserve her kindred?—Stern the king:Though I reject her counsel to forbearThe fight, none better will that fight sustainThan she, whose zeal, fidelity approv'd,And valour, none can equal but the sonOf Gobryas. Go, Mardonius, see the fleetPrepar'd by morning; let Argestes burnThe citadel and temples; I conferOn him that office.—Utt'ring this, he turn'dApart; forlorn Argestes hence presag'd
Decline of regal favour, cent'ring allIn Gobrya's son, who fiercely thus pursued:Thou hear'st the king; now hear a soldier's tone:Of old I know thee slanderer of worth;And I, distinguish'd by a late success,To envious eyes no welcome guest return.Thou canst traduce the absent, whom thy tongueWould flatter present. Not in Sufa's court,Amid the soft security of peace,We languish now; great Xerxes on the stageOf glorious war, amid the din of arms,Can hear thy coz'ning artifice no more.Oh that he ne'er had listen'd! Asia's lord,When to a Tyrian trafficker demean'd,He barter'd for his glory. By my sword,Leonidas, preferring fame to swayO'er proffer'd Greece, was noble! What thy part,Who tamely proff'ring wast with scorn dismiss'd?Go, burn the fanes! Destruction is thy joy.He said, departing swiftly; on his wayMeets Artamanes, meritorious youth,Who, not resembling an unworthy sire,Had fix'd th' esteem of that illustrious man.To him Mardonius: Brave Autarctus greetIn words like these—Exalted to the bedOf bright Sandauce, sister of thy king,Now is the season to approve thy worth.Collect ten thousand warriors on the strandWhich faces Salamis; an island near,Psyttalia nam'd, possess; ere long the foesAgainst her craggy border may be driven;Let spoils and captives signalize thy zeal.Thou, Artamanes, must attend him there,Nor let me want intelligence. Farewel!This mandate giv'n, the active chief proceedsWith steps impatient to Phaleron's port.End of the Fourth Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the FIFTH.THE sun was set; Autarctus and his band,In haste collected, through nocturnal shadesTo small Psyttalia pass'd a narrow frith.As on a desert forest, where at nightA branching oak some traveller hath climb'dTo couch securely; if the trunk besetBy famish'd wolves in herd, who thirst for blood,Pale morn discovers to his waking sight,His hair in terrour bristles, pants his breast
In doubt of safety; thus Aurora shew'dThe unexpected gleam of Persian arms,Which fill'd Psyttalia, while the Attic strand,With numbers equal to its sandy storesWas cover'd, and Phaleron's road with masts,A floating forest, crowded like the pines,Majestic daughters of the Pontic woods.Fair Athens burn'd in sight; embodied smokeRose mountainous, emitting pillar'd flames,Whose umber'd light the newly-dawning sunBut half eclips'd. At intervals are heardThe hollow sound of columns prostrate laid,The crash of levell'd walls, of sinking roofsIn massy ruin. Consternation coldBenumbs the Greek spectators, all aghastExcept th' Athenians, whose unshaken mindsTo this expected fate resign'd their homesFor independence. Gigantean rang'dFrom ship to ship Despair; she drives ashore
The timid leaders, changing late resolvesFor gen'rous combat into base retreat.To seek the shelter of their native portsThey clamour loud; the admiral convenesA council; him Themistocles address'd:Now Eurybiades, to whose commandI voluntary yielded, from thy charge,Not less for Athens than for gen'ral Greece,I claim a righteous and heroic part,The promis'd fight in these auspicious streights,Which, rend'ring vain the multitude of foes,Assure success. But separate this fleet,A hundred openings may Barbarians chuseTo Pelops' region; not on ev'ry spotAn isthmian wall is plac'd. Depriv'd of all,If to your succour we Athenians loseAll claim, ye Greeks, be valiant for yourselves!See Attica in flames, the temples raz'd,
The tombs defac'd, the venerable dustOf our forefathers soatter'd in the wind!Would you avoid calamities like these,To sound instruction lean; th' almighty godsWise counsels bless with prosperous events,To its own folly wilful blindness leave.Proud Adimantus, on his birth elate,The admiral of Corinth, envying longCecropia's name and pow'r, arose and spake:For public safety when in council meetMen who have countries, silence best becomesHim who hath none; shall such presume to vote,Too patient Spartan, nay to dictate here,Who cannot tell us they possess a home?For Attica in flames, her temples raz'd,Her tombs disfigur'd, for th' ignoble dustOf thy forefathers scatter'd in the wind,
Thou low-born son of Neocles, must GreeceHer welfare hazard on a single day,Which, unsuccessful, endless ruin brings?Cleander heard, Troezene's youthful chief;Warm was his bosom, eloquent his tongue,Strong-nerv'd his limbs, well exercis'd in arms;Preventing thus Themistocles, he spake:Though blood, Corinthian, be of noblest dye,Base-born the soul when folly is her sire.Absurdity and malice no replyDeserve from thee, Athenian! thee, more wise,More valiant, more distinguish'd in thyself,Than all the vaunted progeny of gods.Did you not mourn, ye deities, to seeA nation, you created with their soil,Forsake that ancient land? or not admireYour greatest work, the conduct of that man,
Who such a race from such endearing homes,Wives, husbands, elders, infants, maidens, youths,In gen'rous quest of liberty could lead?Do you not look indignant down to hearSuch venomous reproaches on his worth,A wrong to Greece? Her saviour him I call,As yet, I trust, his dictates will prevail.While he declaim'd, Themistocles, who scorn'dThe insolent Corinthian, sat and scann'dThe looks of all; his penetrating fightCould read the thoughts of men; the major partHe saw averse to battle, Sparta's chiefUncertain, cold, and slow. Affecting hereDecisive looks, and scorn of more debate,Thus brief he clos'd: Athenians still possessA city buoyant on two hundred keels.Thou, admiral of Sparta, frame thy choice;Fight, and Athenians shall thy arm sustain;
Retreat, Athenians shall retreat to shoresWhich bid them welcome, to Hesperian shores,For them by ancient oracles reserv'd,Safe from insulting foes, from false allies,And Eleutherian Jove will bless their flight:So said your own Leonidas, who diedFor public welfare. You that glorious deathMay render, Spartans, fruitless to yourselves.This said, he left the council; not to fly,But with his wonted policy compelThe Greeks to battle. At a secret coveHe held in constant readiness a skiff,In Persian colours mask'd; he there embark'dThe most entrusted of his household, charg'dWith these instructions: Now return my love,Sicinus, born a Persian, of my houseNot as a slave long habitant, but friend,My children's tutor, in my trust supreme.
To Xerxes' navy sail; accost her chiefIn words like these—Themistocles, who leadsAthenian squadrons, is the monarch's friend,Approv'd by this intelligence; the GreeksIn consternation shortly will resolveTo separate and fly; let Asia's fleetHer numbers round in diligence extend,Investing ev'ry passage; then, confus'd,This whole consederated force of GreeceWill sooner yield than fight, and Xerxes closeAt once so perilous a war.—He ceas'd.Meanwhile the council wasted precious hours,Till Eurybiades at length alarm'dLest all th' Athenians should retreat incens'd,Postpon'd the issue to th' ensuing day.Themistocles, retiring to his tent,There found his wife; his stratagem on wings
Of execution, left his mind serene;Relax'd in thought, he trifled with his boy,Young child, who playful on the mother's lap,Soon as of Xerxes earnest she enquir'd,With frowning graces on his brow of down,Clench'd fast his infant hands. The dame pursues:O that the Greeks would emulate this child,Clench fast their weapons, and confront the foe!Did we abandon our paternal homes,Our nuptial chambers, from the cradle snatchOur helpless babes? Did tender maidens joinUnanimous the cry, 'Embark, embark'For Salamis and freedom!' to beholdThe men debating (so the Attic wivesAre told) uncertain if to fight or serve?Who are the cowards, rather traitors, say?We will assail them, as the Trojan damesDid Polymestor, royal thief, who broke
The holiest ties for gold.—Take comfort, love;All shall be well, Themistocles replied.Yes, I in thee have comfort, she proceeds;Thou canst devise some artifice to urgeEv'n dastards on; Sicinus thou hast sent,I ask not whither.—In a smile her lord:With thy permission, then, the gods remainMy confidents: to ease thee, I proclaimThis boy the first of Greeks; he governs thee,Thou me, I Athens; who shall govern Greece,As I am sure to circumvent the foes.Retiring, seek the town; console the dames;Thy husband never was so high in hope.She pleas'd, departing, spake: To govern theeRequires an art which never woman knew,Nor man; most artful, thou controllest all,Yet call'st, nay often seem'st, thyself controll'd.She distant, thus he meditates alone:True, when I seem controll'd by others most,Then most assur'd my enterprize succeeds.O lib'ral nature! science, arts acquir'd,I little value; while thy light suppliesProfuse invention, let capricious chanceWith obstacles and dangers gird me round,I can surmount them all; nor peace, nor war,Nor all the swift vicissitudes of time,E'er gave emergency a birth too strongFor me to govern. On this crisis hangsMy future greatness; whether joy or griefShall close the term of being, none foreknow;My penetrating spirit I will trustThus far prophetic; for a time, at least,I will possess authority and pow'rTo fix a name enduring like the sun.Thus, in his own strong faculties secure,To rest he tranquil sunk, and slept till dawn;
Then early rose. Advancing from the shore,A manly figure he observes, the faceWrapt in a mantle; as dividing cloudsReveal th' unmuffled sun, the mantle castAside discovers the majestic frontOf Aristides, who the silence breaks:Dissensions past, as puerile and vain,Now to forget, and nobly strive who bestShall serve his country, Aristides warnsHis ancient foe Themistocles. I hearThou giv'st the best of councils, which the GreeksReject, through mean solicitude to fly;Weak men! throughout these narrow seas the foeIs station'd now, preventing all escape.Themistocles, though covetous of fame,Though envying pow'r in others, was not bredIn horrid deserts, not with savage milkOf tigers nurs'd, nor bore a ruthless heart.He thus replied: With gratitude this foeAccepts thy welcome news, thy proffer'd aid,Thy noble challenge; in this glorious raceBe all our strife each other to surpass.First know my inmost secrets; if the streightsAre all invested with Barbarian ships,The act is mine; of our intended flightI through Sicinus have appris'd the foes;Of his success thee messenger I hail.The exile then: Such policy denotesThemistocles; I praise, the Greeks have causeTo bless, thy conduct; teach me now what taskI can achieve; to labour, to adviseWith thee commanding, solely to enjoyThe secret pleasure of preserving Greece,Is my pursuit; the glory all be thine.Before the council shew that honour'd face,Rejoins the chief; report thy tidings there.
To preparation for immediate fightExhort; such notice they would slight in me,In thee all men believe.—This said, they mov'd.Them on their way Myronides approach'd,Xanthippus, Cimon, Aeschylus, and allThe captains, fixing reverential eyesOn Aristides; this the wary sonOf Neocles remark'd; he gains the townOf Salamis, the council there is met;To them th' illustrious exile he presents,At whose appearance all th' assembly rise,Save Adimantus; fast by envy bound,He sits morose; illib'ral then the word,As Aristides was in act to speak,Thus takes: Boeotia, Attica reduc'd,The Dorians, Locrians, you already know;To me this morn intelligence arriv'd,That Thespia, that Platea were in flames,
All Phocis conquer'd; thus alone of GreeceThe Isle of Pelops unsubdued remains.For what is lost, ye Grecians, must we faceSuch mightier numbers, while barbarian hateLurks in Psyttalia, watching for the wrecksOf our defeated navy? Shall we pauseNow at the Isthmus with united forceTo save a precious remnant? Landing there,Your sailors turn to soldiers, oars to spears;The only bulwark you have left, defend.Then Aristides: Ignominious flightNecessity forbids; Aegina's shoreLast night I left; from knowledge I report.The hostile navy bars at either mouthThe narrow streight between Psyttalia's IsleAnd Salamis, where lie your anchor'd ships.But shall the Greeks be terrified? What moreCan they solicit of propitious heav'n,
Than such deluded enemies to face,Who trust in numbers, yet provoke the fightWhere multitude is fruitless?—Closing here,The unassuming exile straight retir'd.Cleander ent'ring heard; while Corinth's chief,Blind with malignity and pride, pursued:Her strength must Greece for Attica destroy'dWaste on the credit of a single tongue,From Athens banish'd? Swift Cleander spake:Is there in Greece who doubts that righteous tongue,Save Adimantus? To suspect the truthOf that illustrious exile, were to proveOurselves both false and timid. But enoughOf altercation; from the fleet I come,The words of Aristides I confirm;Prepare to fight; no passage have our shipsBut through embattled foes.—The council rose.In this tremendous season, thronging roundTh' accomplish'd son of Neocles, their hopesIn his unerring conduct all repose.Thus on Olympus round their father JoveThe deities collected, when the warOf earth's gigantic offspring menac'd heav'n,In his omnipotence of arm and mindConfiding. Eurybiades supremeIn title, ev'ry leader speeds to actWhat great Themistocles suggests; himself,In all expedients copious, seeks his wife,Whom he accosts, encircled where she stoodWith Attic dames: Timothea, now rejoice!The Greeks will fight; to-morrow's sun will giveA glorious day of liberty to Greece.Assemble thou the women; let the dawnBehold you spread the Salaminian beach;In your selected ornaments attir'd,As when superb processions to the gods
Your presence graces, with your children standEncompass'd; cull your fairest daughters, rangeThem in the front; alluring be their dress,Their beauties half discover'd, half conceal'd;As when you practise on a lover's eye,Through that soft portal to invade the heart;So shall the faithful husband from his wifeCatch fire, the father from his blooming race,The youthful warrior from the maid he loves:Your looks will sharpen our vindictive swords.In all the grace of polish'd Athens thusHis charge pronouncing, with a kind embraceHe quits her bosom, nor th' encircling damesWithout respectful admonition leavesTo aid his consort. Grateful in itselfA task she soon begins, which pleases moreAs pleasing him. A meadow fresh in green,Between the sea-beat margin and the walls,
Which bore the island's celebrated name,Extended large; there oft the Attic fairIn bevies met; Themistocles the groundTo them allotted, that communion soft,Or pastime, sweetly cheating, might relieveThe sad remembrance of their native homes.Here at Timothea's summons they conven'dIn multitude beyond the daisies, strewnThick o'er the verdure from the lap of spring,When most profuse. The wives, the mothers hereOf present heroes, there in bud are seenThe future mothers of immortal sons,Of Socrates, of Plato, who to birthHad never sprung if Xerxes had prevail'd,Or would have liv'd Barbarians. On a mountTimothea plac'd, her graceful lips unclos'd:Ye wives, ye mothers, and ye fair betroth'd,Your husbands, sons, and suitors claim that aid
You have to give, and never can so well.A signal day of liberty to GreeceExpect to-morrow; of the glorious sceneBecome spectators; in a bridal dress,Ye wives, encompass'd with your tender babes,Ye rev'rend matrons in your sumptuous robes,As when superb processions to the godsYour presence graces; but ye future brides,Now maids, let all th' allurement of attireEnhance your beauties to th' enamour'd eye:So from the face he loves shall ev'ry youthCatch fire, with animating passion lookOn her, and conquer. Thus Cecropia's maids,Who left their country rather than abideImpure compulsion to Barbarian beds,Or ply the foreign loom with servile hands,Shall live to see their hymeneal morn;Bless'd in heroic husbands, shall transmitTo late posterity the Attic name.
And you, whose exemplary steps beganOur glorious emigration, you shall seeYour lords, your sons, in triumph to your homesReturn, ye matrons—Or with them will die,If fortune frown, Laodice aloud;For this I hold a poniard; ere endureA Persian yoke, will pierce this female heart.Enthusiastic ardour seems to changeTheir sex; with manlike firmness all consentTo meet Timothea there by early dawnIn chosen raiment, and with weapons arm'd,As chance should furnish. Thus Timothea sway'd,The emulator of her husband's art,But ne'er beyond immaculate intent;At her suggestion interpos'd her friendLaodice, the consort young and fairOf bold Aminias, train'd by naval Mars,From the same bed with Aeschylus deriv'd.Troezene's leader, passing by, admir'dThe gen'rous flame, but secretly rejoic'dIn Ariphilia at Calauria safe;He to thy tent, Themistocles, was bound.Thee to Sicinus list'ning, just return'dFrom his successful course, Cleander found,Thee of thy dear Timothea first inform'd,While thou didst smile applause. The youth pursued:From Aristides I deputed come;He will adventure from Psyttalia's isleThis night to chace the foe, if thou concurIn help and counsel: bands of Attic youth,Superfluous force excluded from the fleet,With ready arms the enterprize demand;Them, with his troop, Oïlean Medon joins.A noble Grecian, sage, experienc'd, brave,Returns the chief; my answer is concise:
Sicinus, fly! their pinnaces and skiffsCommand th' Athenian vessels to supplyAt Aristides' call; th' attempt is wise,Becoming such a soldier; thou remainWith him, to bring me tidings of success.Swift as a stone from Balearic slings,Sicinus hastens to th' Athenian fleet;Cleander light th' important order bearsTo Aristides, whose exalted voiceCollects the banding youth. So gen'rous houndsThe huntsman's call obey; with ringing pealsTheir throats in tune delight Aurora's ear;They pant impatient for the scented field,Devour in thought the victims of their speed,Nor dread the rav'nous wolf, nor tusky boar,Nor lion, king of beasts. The exile feelsReturning warmth, like some neglected steedOf noblest temper, from his wonted haunts
Who long hath languish'd in the lazy stall;Call'd forth, he paws, he snuffs th' enliv'ning air,His strength he proffers in a cheerful neighTo scour the vale, to mount the shelving hill,Or dash from thickets close the sprinkling dew.He thus to Medon: Of Psyttalia's shoreThat eastern flat contains the Persian chief,Known by his standard; with four thousand youthsMake thy impression there; the western endOur foes neglect, a high and craggy part;But nature there through perforated rockHath left a passage, with its mouth aboveConceal'd in bushes; this, to me well known,I will possess; thence rushing, will surroundThe unsuspecting Persian. Darkness falls;Let all embark; at midnight ply the oar.They hear and march; allotted seats they takeAboard the skiffs Sicinus had prepar'd,
Impatient waiting, but impatience keepsHer peace. The second watch is now elaps'd,That baneful season, mark'd in legends old,When death-controlling sorcery compell'dUnwilling spirits back to mortal clayEntomb'd, when dire Thessalian charmers call'dDown from her orb the pallid queen of night,And hell's tremendous avenues unclos'd;To Asia's mothers now of real bane,Who soon must wail ten thousand slaughter'd sons.The boats in order move; full-fac'd the moonExtends the shadows of a thousand mastsAcross the mirror of cerulean floods,Which feel no ruffling wind. A western courseWith his division Aristides steers,The Locrian eastward; by whose dashing oarsA guard is rous'd, not timely to obstructHis firm descent, yet ready on the strandTo give him battle. Medon's spear by fate
Is wielded; Locrians and Athenians sweepThe foes before them; numbers fresh maintainUnceasing conflict, till on ev'ry sideHis reinforcement Aristides pours,And turns the fight to carnage: by his armBefore a tent of stately structure sinksAutarctus brave in death. The twilight breaksOn heaps of slaughter; not a Persian livesBut Artamanes, from whose youthful browThe beaver sever'd by th' auspicious steelOf Medon, shew'd a well-remember'd face;The Locrian swift embrac'd him, and began:Deserve my kindness by some grateful newsOf Meliboeus and the Delphian priest;Not Aeschylus in pity shall exceedMy care in this thy second captive state.His grateful news the Persian thus repeats:Nicaea, fort of Locris, them contains;
Though pris'ners, happy in the guardian careOf Artemisia. What disastrous sight!Autarctus there lies prostrate in his blood.Oh, I must throw me at the victor's feet!He went, by Medon introduc'd, to kneel;Forbid by Aristides, he began:My own compassion to solicit yours,Without disgrace might bend a satrap's knee;I have a tale of sorrow to unfold,Might soften hearts less humaniz'd and justThan yours, O gen'rous Grecians! In that tentThe widow'd wife of this late envied prince,Young, royal matron—twenty annual sunsShe hath not told—three infants ... At these wordsThe righteous man of Athens stays to hearNo more; he gains the tent, he enters, viewsSandauce, silent in majestic woe,
With her three children in their eastern vestsOf gems and gold; urbanity forbidsTo interrupt the silence of her grief;Sicinus, waiting nigh, he thus enjoins:Thou, born a Persian, from a ghastly stageOf massacre and terrour these transportTo thy own lord, Themistocles; the spoilsAre his, not mine. Could words of comfort healCalamity thus sudden and severe,I would instruct thy tongue; but mute respectIs all thy pow'r can give, or she receive.Apprise the gen'ral that Psyttalia's coastI will maintain with Medon, from the wrecksTo save our friends, our enemies destroy.He then withdraws; Athenians he commandsAutarctus' body to remove from sight;When her pavilion now Sandauce leaves,
Preceded by Sicinus. On the groundShe bends her aspect, not a tear she dropsTo ease her swelling heart; by eunuchs led,Her infants follow; while a troop of slaves,With folded arms across their heaving breasts,The sad procession close. To Medon hereSpake Artamanes: O humane! permitMe to attend this princess, and consoleAt least, companion of her woes, bewailA royal woman from Darius sprung.Him not a moment now his friend detains;At this affecting season he defersEnquiry more of Meliboeus, knownSafe in Nicaea; Persia's youth departs;The mournful train for Salamis embark.End of the Fifth Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the SIXTH.BRIGHT pow'r, whose presence wakens on the faceOf nature all her beauties, gilds the floods,The crags and forests, vine-clad hills and fields,Where Ceres, Pan, and Bacchus in thy beamsRejoice; O Sun! thou o'er Athenian tow'rs,The citadel and fanes in ruin huge,Dost rising now illuminate a sceneMore new, more wondrous, to thy piercing eye,Than ever time disclos'd. Phaleron's wave
Presents three thousand barks in pendants rich;Spectators, clust'ring like Hymettian bees,Hang on the burden'd shrouds, the bending yards,The reeling masts; the whole Cecropian strand,Far as Elousis, seat of mystic rites,Is throng'd with millions, male and female raceOf Asia and of Libya, rank'd on foot,On horses, camels, cars. Aegaleos tall,Half down his long declivity where spreadsA mossy level, on a throne of goldDisplays the king environ'd by his courtIn oriental pomp; the hill behind,By warriors cover'd, like some trophy hugeAscends in varied arms and banners clad;Below the monarch's feet th' immortal guard,Line under line, erect their gaudy spears;Th' arrangement, shelving downward to the beach,Is edg'd by chosen horse. With blazing steelOf Attic arms encircled, from the deep
Psyttalia lifts her surface to the sight,Like Ariadne's heav'n-bespangling crown,A wreath of stars; beyond, in dread array,The Grecian fleet, four hundred gallies, fillThe Salaminian streights; barbarian prowsIn two divisions point to either mouthSix hundred brazen beaks of tow'r-like ships,Unwieldy bulks; the gently-swelling soilOf Salamis, rich island, bounds the view.Along her silver-sanded verge array'd,The men at arms exalt their naval spearsOf length terrific. All the tender sex,Rank'd by Timothea, from a green ascentLook down in beauteous order on their sires,Their husbands, lovers, brothers, sons, prepar'dTo mount the rolling deck. The younger damesIn bridal robes are clad; the matrons sageIn solemn raiment, worn on sacred days;But white in vesture like their maiden breasts,
Where Zephyr plays, uplifting with his breathThe loosely-waving folds, a chosen lineOf Attic graces in the front is plac'd;From each fair head the tresses fall, entwin'dWith newly-gather'd flowrets; chaplets gayThe snowy hand sustains; the native curls,O'ershading half, augment their pow'rful charms;While Venus, temper'd by Minerva, fillsTheir eyes with ardour, pointing ev'ry glanceTo animate, not soften. From on highHer large controlling orbs Timothea rolls,Supassing all in stature, not unlikeIn majesty of shape the wife of Jove,Presiding o'er the empyreal fair.Below, her consort in resplendent armsStands near an altar; there the victim bleeds,The entrails burn; the fervent priest invokesThe Eleutherian pow'rs. Sicinus comes,Sandauce follows; and in sumptuous vests,
Like infant Castor and his brother fair,Two boys; a girl like Helen, ere she threwDelicious poison from her fatal eyes,But tripp'd in blameless childhood o'er the meadsOf sweet Amyclae, her maternal seat:Nor less with beauty was Sandauce grac'dThan Helen's mother, Leda, who enthrall'dTh' Olympian god. A starting look the priestCast on the children; eager by the handThemistocles he grasp'd, and thus aloud:Accept this omen! At th' auspicious sightOf these young captives, from the off'ring burstUnwonted light; Fate's volume is unroll'd,Where victory is written in their bloodTo Bacchus, styl'd Devourer, on this isle,Amid surrounding gloom, a temple hoarBy time remains; to Bacchus I devoteThese splendid victims; while his altar smokes,
With added force thy prow shall pierce the foe,And conquest sit triumphant on thy mast.So spake religious lips; the people heard,Believing heard:—To Bacchus, Bacchus giveThe splendid victims, hoarse acclaim resounds.Myronides, Xanthippus, Cimon good,Brave Aeschylus, each leader is unmann'dBy horror, save the cool, sagacious sonOf Neocles; the prophet he accosts:Wise, Euphrantides, are thy holy words!To that propitious god these children bear;Due time apply from each Barbarian stainTo purify their limbs; attentive watchThe signal rais'd for onset; then employThy pious knife to win the grace of heav'n.The chiefs amaz'd, the priest applauding look'd.A young, a beauteous mother at this doom
Of her dear babes is present. Not her locksShe tore, nor beat in agony her breast,Nor shriek'd in frenzy; frozen, mute, she stands,Like Niobe just changing into stone,Ere yet sad moisture had a passage foundTo flow, the emblem of maternal grief:At length the rigour of her tender limbsDissolving, Artamanes bears awayHer fainting burden, while th' inhuman seerTo slaughter leads her infants. Ev'ry eyeOn them is turn'd. Themistocles, unmark'dBy others, beck'ning draws Sicinus nigh,In secret thus commission'd: Chuse a bandFrom my entrusted menials; swift o'ertake,Like an assistant join this holy man;Not dead, but living, shall these infant headsAvail the Grecians. When the direful grove,Impenetrably dark'ning, black with night,That antiquated seat of horrid rites,
You reach, bid Euphrantides, in my name,This impious, fruitless homicide forbear;If he refuse, his savage zeal restrainBy force.—This said, his disencumber'd thoughtsFor instant fight prepare; with matchless artTo rouse the tend'rest passions of the soulIn aid of duty, from the altar's height,His voice persuasive, audible, and smooth,To battle thus his countrymen inflames:Ye pious sons of Athens, on that slopeBehold your mothers! husbands, fathers, seeYour wives and race! before such objects dear,Such precious lives defending, you must wieldThe pond'rous naval spear; ye gallant youths,Look on those lovely maids, your destin'd brides,Who of their pride have disarray'd the meadsTo bind your temples with triumphal wreaths;Can you do less than conquer in their sight,
Or conquer'd perish? Women ne'er deserv'dSo much from men; yet what their present claim?That by your prowess their maternal seatThey may revisit; that Cecropia's gatesMay yield them entrance to their own abodes,There meritorious to reside in peace,Who cheerful, who magnanimous, those homesTo hostile flames, their tender limbs resign'dTo all the hardships of this crowded spot,For preservation of the Attic name,Laws, rites, and manners. Do your women askToo much, along their native streets to moveWith grateful chaplets for Minerva's shrine,To view th' august acropolis again,And in procession celebrate your deeds?Ye men of Athens! shall those blooming budsOf innocence and beauty, who discloseTheir snowy charms by chastity reserv'dFor your embraces, shall those spotless maids
Abide compulsion to Barbarian beds?Their Attic arts and talents be debas'dIn Persian bondage? Shall Cephissian banks,Callirhoë's fountain, and Ilissus pure,Shall sweet Hymettus never hear againTheir graceful step rebounding from the turf,With you companions in the choral dance,Enamour'd youths, who court their nuptial hands?A gen'ral paean intercepts his voice;On ringing shields the spears in cadence beat;While notes more soft, but, issued from such lips,Far more inspiring, to the martial songUnnumber'd daughters of Cecropia join.Such interruption pleas'd the artful chief,Who said no more. Descending, swift he caughtThe favourable moment; he embark'd,All ardent follow'd; on his deck conven'd,Myronides, Xanthippus, Cimon bold,Aminias, Aeschylus, he thus exhorts:My brave associates, publish o'er the fleet,That I have won the Asian Greeks, whom forceNot choice against us ranges, to retainTheir weapons sheath'd, unting'd with kindred blood.Not less magnanimous, and more inflam'd,Mardonius too ascends the stately deckOf Ariabignes; there each leader, call'dTo hear the royal mandate, he address'd:Behold your king, inclos'd by watchful scribes,Unfolding volumes like the rolls of fate!The brave, the fearful, character'd will standBy name, by lineage there; his searching eyeWill note your actions, to dispense rewardsOf wealth and rank, or punishment and shameIrrevocably doom. But see a spoilBeyond the pow'r of Xerxes to bestow,By your own prowess singly to be won,
Those beauteous women; emblems they of Greece,Shew what a country you are come to share.Can victory be doubtful in this cause?Who can be slow when riches, honours, fame,His sov'reign's smile, and beauty, are the prize?Now lift the signal for immediate fight.He spake applauded; in his rapid skiffWas wafted back to Xerxes, who enthron'dHigh on Aegaleos anxious sat to viewA scene which nature never yet display'd,Nor fancy feign'd. The theatre was Greece,Mankind spectators; equal to that stageThemistocles, great actor! by the pow'rOf fiction present in his teeming soul,Blends confidence with courage, on the GreeksImposing firm belief in heav'nly aid.I see, I see divine Eleusis shootA spiry flame auspicious tow'rds the fleet.
I see the bless'd Aeacidae; the ghostsOf Telamon and Peleus, Ajax there,There bright Achilles buoyant on the gale,Stretch from Aegina their propitious hands.I see a woman! It is Pallas! Hark!She calls! How long, insensate men, your prowsWill you keep back, and victory suspend?He gives the signal. With impetuous heatOf zeal and valour, urging sails and oars,Th' Athenians dash the waters, which disturb'd,Combine their murmur with unnumber'd shouts;The gallies rush along like gliding clouds,That utter hollow thunder as they sweepA distant ridge of hills. The crowded linesOf Xerxes' navy, in the streights confus'd,Through their own weight and multitude ill steer'd,Are pierc'd by diff'rent squadrons, which their chiefs,Each with his tribe, to dreadful onset led.
Th' unerring skill of Pallas seem'd to form,Then guide their just arrangement. None surpass'dThe effort bold of Aeschylus; two shipsOf large construction, boast of naval Tyre,His well-directed beak, o'erlaid with brass,Transpierces; Attic Neptune whelms his floodsO'er either found'ring bulk. Three more, by flightWreck'd on Psyttalia, yield their victim crewsTo Aristides; vigilant and direAgainst the ravager of Greece he stood,Like that Hesperian dragon, wakeful guardTo Atlantēan fruit. Th' intrepid sonOf Neocles, disdaining meaner spoilThan Asia's king-born admiral, with sailsOutspread to fresh'ning breezes, swiftly steer'dBy Ariabignes, crashing as he pass'dThe triple tire of oars; then grappling, pour'dHis fierce assailants on the splendid poop.To this attack the gallant prince oppos'd
His royal person; three Athenians bleedBeneath him; but Themistocles he meets.Seed of Darius, Ariabignes fallsIn Xerxes' view, by that unrivall'd chiefWhose arm, whose conduct, Destiny that dayObey'd, while fortune steady on her wheelLook'd smiling down. The regal flag descends,The democratic standard is uprear'd,Where that proud name of Eleutheria shinesIn characters of silver. Xerxes feelsA thrilling horror, such as pierc'd the soulOf pale Belshazzar, last on Ninus' throne,When in the pleasures of his festive boardHe saw the hand portentous on the wallOf Babylon's high palace write his doom,With great Assyria's downfal. Caria's queenNot long continues in a distant post,Where blood-stain'd billows on her active oarsDash thick-adhering foam; tremendous sight
To Adimantus, who before her fliesWith his dismay'd Corinthians! She suspendsPursuit; her sov'reign's banner to redeemAdvances; furious in her passage sendsTwo ships to perish in the green abyssWith all their numbers; this her sov'reign sees,Exclaiming loud, my women fight like men,The men like women. Fruitless yet her skill,Her courage vain; Themistocles was there;Cilicians, Cyprians shunn'd his tow'ring flagOn Ariabignes' mast. The efforts jointOf gallant Troezen and Aegina brokeTh' Aegyptian line, whose chief-commanding deckPresents a warrior to Cleander's eye,A warrior bright in gold, for valour moreConspicuous still than radiancy of arms.Cleander him assails; now front to front,Each on his grappled gunnel firm maintainsA fight still dubious, when their pointed beaks
Auxiliar Aeschylus and Cimon strikeDeep in the hostile ship, whose found'ring weight,Swift from her grapples loosen'd by the shock,Th' affrighted master on Psyttalia drivesA prey to Medon. Then th' Aegyptians fly,Phoenicians, fam'd on oriental waves,Resign the day. Myronides in chace,Xanthippus, Cimon, bold Aminias gor'dThe shatter'd planks; the undefended decksRan purple. Boist'rous hurricanes, which sweepIn blasts unknown to European climesThe western world remote, had nature call'dTheir furies hither, so with wrecks and deadHad strewn the floods, disfigur'd thus the strands.Behold Cleander from achievements highBears down with all Troezene's conq'ring lineOn Artemisia: yet she stops awhile,In pious care to save the floating corse
Of Ariabignes; this perform'd, retreats;With her last effort whelming, as she steer'd,One Grecian more beneath devouring waves,Retreats illustrious. So in trails of lightTo night's embrace departs the golden sun,Still in remembrance shining; none believeHis rays impair'd, none doubt his rise againIn wonted splendour to emblaze the sky.Laconian Eurybiades engag'dSecure of conquest; his division heldThe eastern streights, where loose Pamphylians spreadA timid canvass, Hellespontine Greeks,Ionians, Dorians, and Aeolians rear'dUnwilling standards. A Phoenician crew,Cast on the strand, approach th' imperial throne,Accusing these of treachery. By chanceA bold Ionian, active in the fight,
To Xerxes true, that moment in his kenBears down an Attic ship.—Aloud the king:Scribes, write the name of that Ionic chief,His town, his lineage. Guards, surround these slaves,Who, fugitive themselves, traduce the brave;Cut off their heads: the order is perform'd.A favour'd lord, expressing in his lookA sign of pity, to partake their doomThe tyrant wild commands. Argestes' heartAdmits a secret joy at Persia's foil;He trusts that, blind by fear, th' uncertain princeTo him his wonted favour would restore,Would crush Mardonius, author of the war,Beneath his royal vengeance; or that chief,By adverse fate oppress'd, his sway resign.But as the winds or thunders never shookDeep-rooted Aetna, nor the pregnant cloudsDischarg'd a flood extinguishing his fires,
Which inexhausted boil the surging massOf fumy sulphur; so this grim eventShook not Mardonius, in whose bosom glow'dHis courage still unquench'd, despising chanceWith all her band of evils. In himselfCollected, on calamity he foundsA new, heroic structure in his mind,A plan of glory forms to conquer GreeceBy his own prowess, or by death atoneFor his unprosp'rous counsels. Xerxes now,Amid the wrecks and slaughter in his sight,Distracted vents his disappointed pride:Have I not sever'd from the side of ThraceMount Athos? bridg'd the Hellespont? Go, fillYon sea; construct a causeway broad and firm;As o'er a plain my army shall advanceTo overwhelm th' Athenians in their isle.He rises; back to Athens he repairs.Sequester'd, languid, him Mardonius finds,Deliv'ring bold this soliderly address:Be not discourag'd, sov'reign of the world!Not oars, not sails and timber, can decideThy enterprize sublime. In shifting strife,By winds and billows govern'd, may contendThe sons of traffic; on the solid plainThe gen'rous steed and soldier; they aloneThy glory must establish, where no swellOf fickle floods, nor breath of casual gales,Assist the skilful coward, and controul,By nature's wanton but resistless might,The brave man's arm. Unaided by her hand,Not one of these light mariners will faceThy regal presence at the Isthmian fenceTo that small part of yet unconquer'd GreeceThe land of Pelops. Seek the Spartans there;
There let the slain Leonidas reviveWith all his warriors whom thy pow'r destroy'd;A second time their gen'rous blood shall dyeThe sword of Asia. Sons of those who toreTh' Assyrian, Lydian scepters from their kings,Thy Medes and Persians, whose triumphant armsFrom distant shores of Hellespont have tam'dSuch martial nations, have thy trophies rais'dIn Athens, bold aggressor; they shall plantBefore thy sight, on fam'd Eurota's shore,Th' imperial standard, and repair the shameOf that uncertain flutt'ring naval flag,The sport of winds. The monarch's look betray'dThat to expose his person was the leastOf his resolves. Mardonius pierc'd his thoughts,And thus in manly policy pursued:If Susa, long forlorn, at length may claimThe royal presence; if the gracious thought
Of his return inspire my sov'reign's breastThroughout his empire to rekindle joy;Let no dishonour on thy Persians fall,Thy Medes; not they accomplices in flightWith vile Aegyptians, with Cilicians base,Pamphylians, Cyprians. Let not Greece derideA baffled effort in a gallant raceWho under Cyrus triumph'd, whom to fameDarius led, and thou with recent wreaths,O conqueror of Athens! hast adorn'd.Since they are blameless, though thy will decreeThy own return, and wisely would secureSuperfluous millions in their native homes,Before chill winter in his barren armsConstrain the genial earth; yet leave behindBut thirty myriads of selected bandsTo my command, I pledge my head that GreeceShall soon be Persia's vassal. Xerxes pleas'd,Concealing yet that pleasure, artful thus:Deliberation to thy counsel dueShall be devoted; call the Carian queen.She then was landed; through Cecropia's streetsA solemn bier she follow'd, where the corseOf Ariabignes lay. Mardonius met,And thus address'd her: Meritorious dame,Of all the myriads whom retreat hath sav'd,Hail! crown'd with honour! Xerxes thro' my voiceRequires thy counsel to decide on mine.I add no more; thy wisdom, candour, faithI trust; without a murmur will submitTo thy decision, but to thine alone.My care shall tend that clay, among the deadPerhaps the only glorious.—She departs.He seeks the Magi, greeted in these words:Receive this body, all which now remainsOf Ariabignes; let no dirge deplore
Him as unhappy; Horomazes smilesOn such a death; your lamentations ventOn human nature, humbled and debas'dBy cowards, traitors, who surviv'd this day,Ne'er to outlive their shame. Ye vet'ran bandsOf Medes and Persians, who surround in tearsThese honour'd reliques; warriors who subduedThe banks of Nile, where Hyperanthes fought,And late with me through Macedon and ThraceSwept like a whirlwind; change your grief to rage,To confidence that, unresisted still,You on the plain recov'ring what by seaIs lost, avenging this illustrious dead,From this enthrall'd metropolis of GreeceShall carry devastation, sword, and flamesTo Lacedaemon, now your only foe.The native Medes and Persians at his wordsAre fir'd, in strength, in courage, not unlike
Their brave commander, who in scorn beheldTh' inferior herds of nations. Now the sunGlows on the ocean. To his tent retiresMardonius; sternly in his wounded soulThe late disgrace of Xerxes he revolves,Yet soothes his anguish by enliv'ning hopeOf glory. Thus the tawny king of beastsWho o'er Numidian wastes hath lost a dayIn fruitless chace, of wonted food depriv'd,Growls in his den; but meditates a range,Enlarg'd and ceaseless, through unbounded woods,To glut his empty maw. Her charge perform'd,Before him sudden Artemisia stands.As Cynthia steps unveil'd from sable cloudsOn some benighted traveller, who beatsA path untried, but persevering firmWith undiminish'd vigour, well deservesHer succ'ring light,—the queen in cheering smilesAccosts the hero: I have seen the king,
Have heard thy counsel, have approv'd, confirm'd.Thy spirit, son of Gobryas, I applaud.Thou, not discourag'd by our foul defeat,From this unwieldy multitude the braveWouldst separate, and boldly at their headThy life adventure. Xerxes may assumeA doubtful aspect. Counsel given by thee,By me approv'd, Argestes may opposeWith all his malice. Only thou suppressThe fiery sparks which animate thy blood;In patience wait; thy dictates will prevail,Our common vengeance too that traitor feel,Whom I saw lurking near the king's retreat.Farewel.—She leaves him happy in her voiceOf approbation, happier in her eye,Which spoke for his prosperity a wish;That eye, enlight'ning her majestic faceWith added lustre, from his grateful senseOf her transcendent talents thus applied
To his behoof. His manly bosom feels,Beyond a veneration of her worth,Beyond a friendship to her friendship due,Desire of her society in war,Perhaps in peace. Participated thoughtsWith her, united counsels, he esteemsA gain to both. His high-aspiring soulEnjoys the thought, nor entertains a shadeOf jealousy or envy at her fame.He ruminates: Observing her advice,I shall succeed. Then starting—Earth and heaven!Where is Masistius? Oh ungen'rous heart!Which on the scent of its ambitious chaceForgot that best of counsellors and guides,Friend of my infant, youthful, manly age!If he be lost!—Oh ominous the thought!Masistius lost!—My fortune, hopes, and joys,My virtues are no more!—He rushes wild
Abroad; commands a gen'ral search; himselfDown to the port precipitates his course.The son of Gobryas and the Carian queenWere thus remov'd. Argestes in that hourObtain'd access to Xerxes. Cold with fear,By fortune tam'd, tormented still by pride,Th' uncertain king to him their counsel told;When thus Argestes, feigning wonder, spake:Dost thou appoint Mardonius king in Greece?O liberal prince! what servant in thy trainWould not confront all danger to possessAn empire, which the Hellespont aloneWill bound? Already Macedonia's lord,Young Alexander, all the Thracian chiefs,Like humble vassals to Mardonius bend.Why should the king himself not conquer Greece,Now more than half reduc'd? Complete the work
Appointed; choak the Salaminian floods;O'erwhelm th' Athenians in their isle, and reignThyself supreme. The monarch starts, and wildIn look, commands Argestes to pursueTh' impracticable toil with all the host;Then, stretch'd along, in vain solicits rest.End of the Sixth Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the SEVENTH.MEANTIME while Venus from her Colian dome,Which o'er Phaleron cast a holy shade,Beheld the shatter'd fleet of Xerxes driv'nTo refuge there precarious; from pursuitRecall'd, the Greeks, observant of their laws,Applied their pious labour to collectTheir floating dead, and send with honours dueSuch glorious manes to the blest abodes.With artful assiduity remain'd
Themistocles presiding, so to courtReligion's favour. From the solemn toil,Accomplish'd now, to Salaminian strandsHe veers; the slain are landed; then his deckHimself forsakes. As Neptune, when the winds,His ministers of anger to o'erwhelmThe pride of daring mortals, have fulfill'dHis stern behests, and shook the vast profound,At length composing his afflicted reign,Serene from sated vengeance seeks the armsOf Amphitrite, watching his returnWith soft impatience in her placid grotAmidst encircling Nereids; so the chiefTo his Timothea in triumphant paceAdvances. She that day had never leftThe beach; surrounded by Athenian fair,She rushes forward to his wish'd embrace.He stops; defil'd by slaughter, robs his heartOf such delights, and elegantly thus:O all-surpassing woman, do not dyeThat lovely bosom in Barbarian gore;The blood of Ariabignes, not my own,Encrusts thy husband's cuirass. She replies:Since not thy own, but hostile crimson stainsThy manly chest, Timothea will partakeThe honourable dye. O man divine!Thus for the public with a public kissThee I salute, thee saviour of all Greece,Thee scourge of Asia; thus will ev'ry wifeHer husband; sisters, daughters thus infoldTheir brothers, sires; their tender hands like mine,Like mine their panting breasts, in transport bearThese glorious marks of victory. BeholdThose damsels pure, whose maidenly reserveForbids such rapture; they in smiles, in tearsOf gratitude and gladness, on the headsOf gallant youths triumphal garlands place.Laodice is nigh; she quits th' embraceOf her Aminias, and accosts the chief:Think'st thou, O son of Neocles, the damesOf Athens shrink to see Barbarian blood,Who would have spilt their own, had fortune frown'd;Had you, our slaughter'd husbands, left your wivesNo other choice than servitude or death?Fair dame, united to the bravest chief,In smiles he answers, fortune more benignPreserv'd those husbands for the happiest lot,Society with you. In holy brineOf Neptune's flood permit them now to lave,That love in bridal decency may greetAthenian wives. Ye men of Athens, voteThat ev'ry youth and ev'ry maid betroth'dTo-night be wedded. This the gen'ral voiceConfirms a law. His winning words dispers'd
Th' obedient fair; each warrior in the deepImmers'd his limbs, while Phoebe's argent wheelsTheir track pursuing through unclouded skies,Diffuse around serenity and light.To his Timothea's mansion soon repair'dThemistocles; Sicinus there he found,Who earnest thus address'd him: Thrice I hailMy lord victorious; from thy servant's lipsNow hear a tale to melt the stoniest heartsOf all but Euphrantides, yet with joyReward compassion—To the sable grove,Where yew and cypress veil'd the hoary wallsOf homicidal Bacchus, swift I ledMy choice companions; to the seer I toldThy pleasure; he indignant heard, and forc'dThe victims forward to the fane abhorr'd.I follow'd careful, still in patient hopeThat he, though slow, would uncompell'd submit
To thy commanding will; we enter'd all;Sandauce there at length her silence broke,Whom from her infants none so fell to part.O house of great Darius! where will endThy woes? How many of thy sons are fall'n!Sad Ariana, sacrifice to love!Thou sleep'st; thy wretched sister lives to seeHer children butcher'd—On the pavement dampShe threw her limbs, she clasp'd her lovely babes;They shudd'ring view Sandauce in distress;Too young to know their danger, they bewailTheir mother, not themselves. The captive youth,Still sedulous and tender, from the spot,Where as in shackles of despair she lay,Essay'd in vain to raise her. Now the seer,Who in my look determination saw,Approach'd the loathsome idol, foul by age,In fell presumption utt'ring thus his wrath:These victims, Bacchus, did my voice devoteTo thy neglected altar; of thy spoilThemistocles defrauds thee; on his headLet fall thy vengeance, not on mine, stern god!This heard, the willing captives I remov'dFrom that grim seat of terror to these wallsOf hospitality. Sicinus clos'd,When Aristides enter'd. Hail, he said,Well hast thou done, Themistocles! beholdMe come attendant on illustrious dead,Whom on Psyttalia cast I bring to shareThe public funeral honours.—I saluteThee too, the son of Neocles returns;Our noble strife to serve the public bestWe both have well commenc'd. Prepare thee nowTo give thy counsel on my new deviceFor better service still. Our climate holdsAll Asia now, her princes, wealth, and arms;
I can detain her, till consuming timeBy famine, sword and pestilence, exhaustHer strength, and cover Greece with Persian graves.Too high thy ardour mounts, replies the sage;Forbear to think of strength'ning such a pow'rBy desperation. To the feeble bruteNecessity gives courage. Such a hostOf men and steeds innum'rous on our fields,By nature's stimulating wants compell'dTo fight for life, might blast our budding hopes.Ah! rather some new stratagem deviseTo send the Persians back; let famine, want,Let pestilence pursue their tedious flight,Depriv'd of succour from their vanquish'd fleet,Which do thou chace and bury in the waves.Farewell! my post demands me. Since their foil,I have observ'd the enemies employ'dIn wild attempts to fill the streight profoundBetween Psyttalia and th' Athenian shore.He gone, these thoughts Themistocles revolves:I will adopt his counsel, safe for Greece,Nor less for me; his banishment prolong'dWill discontent the people, and repeal'dPlace him commander in th' Athenian campTo rival me. Discouraging the warBy land, confining to the sea our strength,I shall secure pre-eminence. From thoughtTo action turn'd, Sicinus he bespake:Before my presence all the captives bring.As Bacchus, not Devourer, in a smileOf heav'nly sweetness, proffer'd soft reliefTo Ariadne, when forlorn she sat,Her fate deploring on the Naxian rock;So gracious, so consoling were the looksThemistocles assum'd, in soothing phraseAccosting thus Sandauce: Thou shalt prove,So shall thy royal house, afflicted fair!
A cordial friend in me. Sicinus, haste;Equip the bark which eastern colours dress,That, ere the moon forsake her lucid path,Thou mayst transport this princess to the king,Her infant train, and this ingenuous youth,With my best greetings. Say, the Athenian chief,Themistocles, these pledges of his truthAnd friendship sends; them rescued I restore,Him next will save. His Hellespontine bridgeThe Greeks vindictive menace to destroy,An enterprize of horror; this my pow'r,My dictates singly can and shall impede,Till he in safety hath regain'd his throne.Sandauce answers: O thou gen'rous Greek,To thee, to thine, may fortune ne'er be cold.But I, partaker of imperial pomp,In ease, in safety nurtur'd, who have deem'dMy state above the sorrows which torment
Inferior mortals, when my soul reflectsOn this new lesson by misfortune taught,Reflects how lately on a field of blood,Young as I am, I saw my husband fall,My children doom'd to sacrifice, myselfTo endless bondage, had not heav'n achiev'dThis marvel of compassion in a foe,I, (O forgive me!) I suspect the lotOf all, ev'n thine. O prosp'rous, godlike man,May Horomazes from thy head avertVicissitudes like mine! may envious fateNe'er bring Sandauce's gratitude to proof!Thou never want the pity thou hast shewn!She ceas'd; she wept. When Artamanes spake:Her debt Sandauce can discharge aloneBy grateful tears; but I can promise more.In Persian thraldom lies a beauteous Greek,Nam'd Amarantha, Delphian Timon's child;
For that bright maid's redemption I am pledg'dTo her afflicted sire. Thy goodness shower'dOn this excelling princess, shall augmentMy zeal the obligation to repayBy Amarantha's freedom; till that hourOf retribution to thy virtues comes,We will proclaim them; nations shall admireThemistocles, and ev'ry heart abhorInhuman Euphrantides. Now return'dSicinus; him they follow'd. On her breastThe lovely mother hush'd her female babe;But cold with horror at remembrance deepOf her unmatch'd calamities that day,She feebly falter'd o'er the sandy beach;While Artamanes led in either handThe tripping boys. Themistocles remain'dIn these reflections, flowing from this proofOf fortune's changes: Few in Athens longSustain their greatness—but to muse on ills
Before they come, both time and thought I waste;Content at present that esteem procur'd,By this fair Persian, in her brother's court,May prove a gain. Timothea now approach'd;His hand affectionate she press'd and spake:How sudden thou my hospitable caresOf their endearing object hast depriv'd!In woe how graceful is that eastern dame!How young a mother! On a widow'd bedHow early cast by fortune! Thou hast sentSicinus with her; ever-watchful man,Some new contrivance thou dost bring to birth;Thou smil'st in silence; listen then to me.Since Aristides on this isle hath shewnThat face rever'd, when banish'd, his recalThe men of Athens, nay the women wish.This by Aminias to th' assembled tribes,Laodice informs me, will be mov'd;
In this expect Myronides the brave,Xanthippus, Cimon, Aeschylus will join.—So will thy husband, interpos'd the chief;I will forestall them, not to others leaveSuch merit with our people.—She rejoin'd:All will applaud thee. Now, my anxious lord,The second watch its measure hath consum'd;The moon descends, the sprightly birds are still;Dead sleep hath laid the soldier on his shield;The active sailor slumbers; all forgetThe hardships, rage, and tumult of the day;All but thyself reposing. Shall that mindContinue ranging o'er the field of thought,In pregnancy exhaustless, till the larkSalute the day-spring with his early song?Till thou unresting, unrefresh'd, resumeThe statesman's troubles, and the soldier's toils?Be counsell'd; oft the thunder-bearing godTo Juno listens; thou my voice obey.He hears; serene conducts her to repose.As Jove on Ida, by Saturnia charm'd,Confess'd a rapture never felt before,While lucid dew of odours from a cloudOf gold distill'd around him; from the turfBeneath his feet while hyacinths upsprung,The unctuous lotos, and the crocus gay,To grace his secret tabernacle thereOf love celestial; so the Attic chiefTo his Timothea, in her chamber pure,With bridal honours deck'd, perfum'd with flow'rs,Whate'er the meads of Salamis supplied,His tender flame in winning language breath'd:Whoe'er had whisper'd on our nuptial dayThat I should view thee, in a time remoteFrom that sweet aera, with superior joy,I should have held him ignorant of love.What is the cause, Timothea, that I feel
My bosom pierc'd by transport yet unknown?That eastern fair, deliver'd from distress,Appearing then the fairest of her sex,Thou dost exceed. Timothea smiling spake:O thou artificer of sweetest wiles,Wouldst thou seduce me into vain belief,That I exceed Sandauce's youthful charms?But wouldst thou know, my husband (solemn hereShe modulates her accents), wouldst thou knowWhy thou survey'st me with uncommon joy?It is the conscience of a noble deed,Of gather'd trophies never match'd before,Creates this change. The perils of this dayWere new to Athens, to thy race, and me;Thy sword hath rescued all, increas'd thy fame,Thy heart exalted; with increas'd delight,Thro' that bright medium of a happy mind,Thou look'st on ev'ry object—sure on me
Not less than others. Artless were these words,By nature prompted, nature's noblest fire.They ceas'd discourse. Her loftiness of mind,His valour, talents, policy, to loveSubside. Perhaps the first of human pairs,Who in the bless'd Assyrian garden met,Were not more happy in their first embrace,Than fair Timothea and her conqu'ring lord!A pleasing stillness on the water sleeps;The land is hush'd; from either host proceedsNo sound, no murmur. With his precious chargeEmbark'd, Sicinus gently steers along;The dip of oars in unison awakeWithout alarming silence; while the moon,From her descending, horizontal car,Shoots lambent silver on the humid bladesWhich cleave the curling slood. On carpets soft
Sandauce's babes devoid of sorrow lie,In sweet oblivious innocence compos'dTo smiling slumber. But the mother's breastAdmits no consolation; when they skimPsyttalia's frith, at memory severeOf that disast'rous isle, she sudden sinksA lifeless image in the watchful armsOf Artamanes, who had studied wellHer sorrows, knew each tender thought and care,Humanity his tutor. Swift he callsSicinus: Friendly pilot, stay thy course;We must not leave Autarctus in his goreBehind, lest grief incurable resideIn this fair breast, perhaps eternal shadeIn these extinguish'd eyes. Sicinus feelsA sympathizing pain, of Persian stockHimself a branch, in Attic soil matur'd;He stops the bark and lands. The Asian tentsWere still erect, whence Aristides comes
In steel accoutred, to salute the dawn,Then breaking. Him Sicinus humbly greets,Requests, obtains the body, which convey'dOn board he careful on the deck bespreadsWith canvass new. Impell'd by active strokesOf oars resum'd, the bounding vessel gainsPhaleron's haven. Artemisia there,Whose vigilance, augmented by defeat,Had kenn'd the bark while distant, now arrestsHer further progress; but no sooner hearsThe sad intelligence Sicinus gives,Than swift descending where Sandauce lay,That mourning fair in friendly strains accosts:O lift thy head, thou daughter of a king!Our sov'reign's sister, sister to the manMy soul rever'd, to Hyperanthes good,The flow'r of Asia's princes! In thy woesI sharing cordial, cordially rejoice
In thy redemption. Leave this doleful keel;Think of thy duty to approach the king;Thy other cares entrust to me.—She said;They row to shore. To Xerxes, then retir'd,The queen conducts Sandauce and her train.The princess thus to him amaz'd began:A widow'd sister, late a wretched slave,With these three orphans just redeem'd from death,Sandauce greets her brother; but her tongueWould be disloyal to obtrude her tale,Her tedious tale of sorrows on his ear.The preservation of her king demandsHis first attention; that attention grantTo him who comes deputed by a Greek,Thy friend, my guardian, saviour of those babes;Oh listen! thy salvation from his lipsReceive. Fast bound by terror was the mouthOf Xerxes.—Then Sicinus: He who ranks
Among the Greeks superior in command,In talents, prudence, policy, and arms,Themistocles, these pledges of his truthAnd friendship sends; them rescued he restores;Thee next will save. Thy Hellespontine bridgeThe Greeks vindictive menace to destroy;An enterprize of horror, which his pow'r,His dictates singly can and will impede,Till thou in safety hast regain'd thy throne.All from his presence straight the king commands,Save Artemisia; her in broken tonesAddresses: Queen of Caria, singly wiseAmong my council, pity, not upbraidThy master, suff'ring by his rash neglectOf thy sage voice unutterable pangs.He paus'd in torture. Prudent, she replied:Without a cause the lord of nations droops;
Mardonius well hath counsel'd thy retreat,Who undertakes to finish, what his swordHath well begun thro' Macedon and Thrace,This mighty war. Thy servant may succeed;In whose behalf? His master's: Thou wilt reapHis fruits of glory; if Mardonius fail,He the disgrace. Thy march commence by dawn;Appoint the fleet's departure swift this night,To guard with force collected and repair'dThe Hellespontine bridge; with grace acceptThe proffer'd service of th' Athenian chief;Load his returning messenger with giftsOf royal price, and, O my gracious lord!Fraternal kindness on Sandauce show'r.Her gallant lord hath perish'd in thy cause,Herself been menac'd by a barb'rous priestTo see her children sacrific'd; a doomThemistocles withstood, and set them free.As when a timid child perceives a cloudObscure the sky, and hears the thunder's peal,He weeps, he trembles, but the cloud dispers'd,The clamour ceasing, and the sun restor'd,His wonted sport resumes, forgetting fear;So chang'd the monarch. Artemisia, go,He said; the satraps instantly convene;Th' Athenian messenger, Argestes' son,Again before us with Sandauce call;Ne'er will I deviate from thy counsels more.First to Sicinus ent'ring he began:Say to thy sender, I accept well pleas'dHis service pass'd and proffers; thou return;To him ten golden talents thou shalt bear.Thee from the depths of sorrow shall the king,Sandauce, raise; demand a present boon;Thou canst not ask what Xerxes will refuse.By gratitude surmounting grief inspir'd,Mov'd to retaliate kindness in the shapeHerself had prov'd, the gen'rous suppliant thus:In Persian thraldom is a Grecian maidOf Delphian lineage, Amarantha nam'd;Her I demand of Xerxes, that my handA captive daughter to a tender sireMay render back; from bondage free his head,Now in Nicaea, and thus far my debtOf gratitude discharge. In transport here,Admiring such perfection of the heart,Spake Artamanes: Ever live the king!There is a captive whom the princess nam'd—Fly thou in search of this requested slave,Son of Argestes, interrupts the king;Let none withold her from Sandauce's pow'r.The female train before the cumb'rous host
Shall move by dawn for Thessaly, there joinThe rest of Asia's dames behind us leftOn our late march; the guard, ten thousand horse,Thou, Artamanes, shalt command.—He said;They all retir'd. A pensive grief o'ercastsSandauce, moving with her children slow,By slaves attended, to the vacant tentAutarctus late possess'd. Argestes' sonObserves her anguish, penetrates her thoughts,In guarded words then proffers this relief:O fairest princess, whose external formBut half displays thy excellence of mind,Wilt thou forgive thy servant, if he feelsWith thee a present sorrow, which the heartFobids the tongue to name? Sandauce, trustMy pious service, and those thoughts compose.She, weeping, looks assent; he speeds away,But meets the body of Autarctus borne
By Artemisia's soldiers. She at first,With care conceal'd, had order'd from the barkHis precious reliques; these the noble youthWith equal care delivers to that skill,Which with Sabaean gums, and scented growthsOf bless'd Arabia, purifies the clayDepriv'd of life, and Time's consuming breathRepels. A regal car he next provides,In full apparel of funereal pomp.End of the Seventh Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the EIGHTH.THE satraps now and leaders, at the callOf Artemisia, were collected roundTheir monarch. Seated on his throne, he spake:Ye princes, satraps, heed our fix'd decree.Our native Asia wants her king; by mornTo Susa we return, but leave behindIn Greece Mardonius, and a chosen hostOf thirty myriads. With command supreme,With our imperial equipage and state,
Him we invest; to him submission payAs to our presence. Artemisia, bearOur sov'reign pleasure to the naval chiefs,That all abandon, e'er the dawn return,Phaleron's port, and hoist their sails to guardThe Hellespont. But thou, entrusted queen,Thy own tried squadron to Spercheos bring;Whence thou must waft to Ephesus a chargeOf high import, the children of thy king.He ceas'd. A stranger, cas'd in steel, approach'd,In look ferocious, limbs and shape robust,Of stature huge; the satraps look'd amaz'd,As were th' immortals, when, th' Olympian steepAscending, grim Briareus first produc'dHis mountain-bulk, and spread his hundred hands,Auxiliary to Jove. The warrior stood,Unbending, far as nature would permit,His rugged brow; when, crouching to the king,
O Xerxes, live for ever, he began:I am Euboean Demonax, the princeOf Oreus late, who earth and water sent,Acknowledging thy empire; from my throneBy curs'd Themistocles expell'd, I join'dThy shelt'ring fleet; at Salamis I fought.An aid of troops and treasure can replaceMe thy true vassal, who will soon reduceThe granary of Athens to thy sway,Euboea, fertile, populous, and rich.The monarch thus: Mardonius, thou hast heard;Begin to use thy plenitude of pow'r;Reject or favour at thy will this pray'r.Mardonius then: My sov'reign liege, the truthFlows from his lips; twelve thousand of thy host,With Mindarus commanding, and of goldA hundred talents, would be well bestow'd
On this important Greek. The king assents;He rises; all disperse. Mardonius nowAccosts the queen, descending to the port:Alas! how uncontrollable the willOf Xerxes! must thou leave me? Since the dayOf Salamis, my best belov'd of friends,Masistius, whether by the waves devour'd,Or slain, or captive, to my search is lost.Foe to inaction, though compos'd and wise,Of courage prone to perilous attempts,He would embark; permitted by the king,Against my warm remonstrance would partakeThe naval conflict. Drooping, while I doubtHis preservation, must I further loseThy fellowship, auspicious, generous queen!Yet stop, a moment listen. On the marchTo Athens first, reposing in a cave,I had a dream, perhaps a vision saw,
To me presaging glory—but successWas wrap'd in clouded mystery. My heartTeems with ill-boding thoughts, yet shall not faint;At least impart thy wishes ere thou sail'st,Thy last instructions! Fortunate thy voice,Benign to me; repeat one parting strain!If I successful to thy presence bringThe palms of conquest, say, accomplish'd queen,Thou wilt accept them with a gracious hand;If unsuccessful I the forfeit payOf this frail being, as becomes the brave,Say, thou wilt praise Mardonius. Sage and graveShe answers: First, despair not to regainThe good Masistius; at the worst endure,That common lot, the death of dearest friends,With patience; long thy courage I have prais'd,Now moderate the flame against a foeNot less discreet, than disciplin'd and bold;Nor let the gloom of superstition awe
Thy noble ardour. On the sharpest sword,The strongest arm, on prudence, martial skill,Not dreams and visions, looks the goddess Fame.If Artemisia's wishes can avail,Be sure to prosper, prosp'ring here to soarAbove the flight of Cyrus.—She departs.Behind her, like the sinking globe of day,She leaves a trail of radiance on his soul;But, to protect him from returning shade,Her light should ne'er forsake him, never set.O'er gen'rous cares not thus Argestes broods;Within his tent he meditates conceal'd;By struggling pride tormented, thus he strivesTo sooth her pangs: I see my pow'r eclips'd;Mardonius governs. Pow'r, thou fleeting gleam,Thee I possess no longer; why regret,When Amarantha's beauty can exchangeThy thorns for lilies? To my own domain
I will transport her; Sipylus hath flow'rsTo drop perfumes in Amarantha's walk;Pactolus, Hermus, my subjected streams,Shall furnish gold; her gems shall India sendTo deck that form, and I in pleasure's foldsForget ambition, stranger to the peaceWhich honour yields. Libidinous in thought,The statesman thus would cheat his baffled pride;Accurs'd of men! who borrow'd from one viceHis med'cine for another (both deformHis ravag'd bosom in alternate strife)Flagitious parent! rivalling in loveHis eldest born! prepost'rous passion, bigWith horror! while the youngest, lov'd by all,By Xerxes favour'd, to Mardonius dear,He held in detestation for his worth,Nor knew the comfort of a virtuous child.With diff'rent thoughts that sleepless youth employ'dThe night, serenely happy in the charge
Humanity impos'd. Before the dawnHis band is arm'd, Sandauce in her car,Among innumerable fair the chiefIn state and woe. Tears trickle at the sightOf great Autarctus in his fun'ral pompDown ev'ry cheek; a solemn sadness reigns;So oft Aurora, sable-suited, leadsA train of clouds, dissolving as they passIn silent show'rs. Through Attica's waste fields,Through half Boeotia, ere his ev'ning clos'd,The second sun conducts them to the gatesOf antient Thebes. They enter; they ascendThe citadel; they find commanding there,New from the ruins of unpeopled towns,Fierce Mithridates. With a kind embrace,To him the gentle Artamanes thus:Hail! brother: twice a captive since we lastAt Delphi parted, I would gladly know
Thy fortune. Tell me, where that beauteous maid,Whom thou didst carry from the Delphian walls?The grim Barbarian spoiler, quick reply'd:Curs'd be her name, her beauty, which could meltA heart like mine! Accurs'd my father's lust,Which seiz'd my captive! Guarded by a troopOf jealous eunuchs, and attendants arm'd,Her in this citadel he still detains.If I refign her, may Plataea's tow'rs,May Thespia's hostile walls by me o'erthrown,A second time to brave me rise from dust.Oh! unbecoming strife, the brother cry'd,Which startles nature! Thanks to Heav'n, the kingHath now decided Amarantha's fate;Her to his royal sister he hath giv'n,A promis'd boon. Sandauce, by the foeRestor'd to freedom, will requite that grace,By rend'ring up this damsel to her sire,
Himself a pris'ner in Nicaea's fort,Then both release from bondage. Further know,In Thebes to morrow Xerxes will appearOn his retreat to Susa. I conductThis train of eastern dames. By rising dawnTo her protection will the princess takeThe Delphian maiden, then proceed. These wordsSting Mithridates; an atrocious deedHe meditates, but artful thus conceals:Not to my father, to the king I yield.This said, they parted. Mithridates heldThe town; his brother's squadrons lay encamp'dWithout the walls. The citadel contain'dA fane of Juno, there Sandauce rests.To Oedipus devoted was a dome,Which Artamanes enter'd, while his heartRan cold and shudder'd at a brother fell,And treach'rous sire, competitors in love;
Abominable strife! His eyes he castO'er all the structure, lighted by the gleamsOf tapers blue attending; he surveys,Insculptur'd round, the horrors which befelThe house of Laius; there th' ill-fated sonHis father slays; incestuous there ascendsHis mother's chamber; daughters he begets,His sisters, sons his brothers; blameless he,A man of virtues by despair oppress'd,Rends forth his eyeballs, on the pavement dash'd.There sev'n dire captains, leagu'd by horrid oathsWhich startled Heav'n, are figur'd; down to HellAmphiarāus on his martial car,Through earth's dividing entrails, there descends;Here Capaneus, blaspheming Jove, expiresAmid vindictive lightnings; mangled there,Eteocles and Polynices fall,Each other's victim to fraternal hate.Full of these hideous images the youth
Reclines disturb'd, unvisited by sleep,Till awful midnight; broken slumber, addsTo his disquiet. In a thrilling dreamThe eyeless ghost of Oedipus ascends;The vacant sockets, where the orbs of sightOnce beam'd, are bleeding fresh; a Stygian pallInfolds the wither'd, pale, sepulchral form;The arms are stretch'd abroad: Forever ThebesMust thou to horror be the guilty stage!It said, and vanish'd. By the phantom wak'd,Or by a sudden clash of mingling swords,With skrieks and tumult, Artamanes rose,Unsheath'd his sabre, grip'd his target fast,And issued swift. Before his startled eyesA beauteous woman, of majestic form,In garb disorder'd, and with ringlets fall'n,Sustains aloft a poinard newly drawnFrom Mithridates' heart, who, sinking, breathesHis last beneath her feet. So Phoebe pierc'd
Orion; so the groaning earth receiv'dHis giant bulk, which insolently dar'dAttempt that child immaculate of JoveWith violence of love. Now spake the fair:If to defend her chastity and fameBecomes a woman, self approv'd at leastI stand, great Timon's daughter, from a lineHeroic sprung, in holy Delphi born;If to have slain a ruffian be a crimeAmong the Persians, give me instant death,Such as becomes my dignity and sex.Her words, her looks, impress'd on ev'ry heartAmaze, and tam'd the savages combin'dWith Mithridates in his impious act.So when, majestic on the choral scene,Her tragic pomp Melpomene displays,In awe profound she hushes rudest minds,
While terror humbles tyrants. Gather'd roundWere numbers now; a thousand torches blaz'd;Sandauce last, environ'd by her guard,Approach'd alarm'd. A wounded eunuch stepp'dBefore the princess; I will cloath in truthMy voice, he said. Argestes to my careEntrusted Amarantha; from that lord,Solicitations, threat'nings, gifts she spurn'd,While I admir'd: Sure virtue hath a rayTo strike the meanest eye. To-night his sonAssail'd our dwelling; with my fellow slaves,All butcher'd, I defended long my charge,By Mithridates from the mansion forc'd;Her chastity the noble maid hath sav'd,Her poniard stretch'd the ravisher in blood.To Artamanes, weeping o'er the corse,Sandauce then: To thy consoling wordsI oft have listen'd, listen thou to mine;
Forgive the maid; illustrious is her deedFor every maid to imitate. With me,Come Amarantha; thou art mine; not longShalt so continue; at Nicaea's fortI will restore thee to a joyful sire,And both to freedom. Morning breaks; the cars,The troops attend; the royal dame renewsHer progress; seated at her footstool weeps,In speechless gratitude, the Delphian fair.By public duty Artamanes rous'd,Not long remains. This last farewell he sighs:Oh! early fall'n! Oh! cut from proudest hopes!Thee, Horomazes, may a brother's tearsFor him propitiate! he hath none to shed.These silent ruins to our father shew,Thou faithful eunuch. May he feel like me!His steed he mounts, and rapidly o'ertakesThe squadrons, op'ning on Cadmean plains.Now Amarantha lifts her grateful head,Intent to speak; but, heavy on the frontOf her protectress, heavier in her breastSat grief, each sense devouring, and her frameEnfeebling; which, too delicately wrought,Endures not ev'n remembrance of distressSo new, so strange in her exalted state,To youth untry'd by evils. She forgetsHer late benignant act, till chance directsHer eye to Amarantha; when her heart,Sooth'd by the conscience of a gen'rous deed,Her faded cheeks relumines with a smile.Then spake the prudent virgin: Persian queen,(Sure such thou art) what marvellous eventGave thee a knowledge of my sire, his place
Of residence, and my disastrous fate?Sense of thy goodness, from my breast would chaceThe memory of troubles, if alas!I did not see thy countenance o'ercast.If thou repent thee, of thy favour deemMe undeserving, send me to abideThe punishment ordain'd by Persian laws;But if thy sorrows are thy own, unmix'dWith my misfortunes, let assiduous zeal,Let tenderest service of my grateful handStrive to relieve the burdens which oppressMy benefactress. In the captive's handSandauce drops her own; in sighs replies:O! by thy aspect of superior moldTo all I e'er beheld of regal race,Resembling me in fortune, lend an ear;My soul conceives a melancholy wishThat thou shouldst hear my story, I to thine
Alternate listen. Mournful converse soonBetween these fairest in their native climesBegan, continued; sev'n diurnal roundsThe sun perform'd, till intercourse of grief,Communicated sighs, unite their mindsIn tender friendship. Diff'rent yet their lots;On Amarantha's cheek the bloom revives;A joyful sire, perhaps a dear betroth'd,Her fortune promis'd. In Sandauce's trainA husband follow'd on his fun'ral bier;Her fleeting hue a sickly paleness taints,Which Artamanes with a sad'ning eyeObserves, portent of malady. Now roseThe eighth sad morn, revealing to their sightNicaea's neighb'ring gate. Sandauce thenTo Artamanes: Take this virtuous maid;To her my promise, to her father thineFulfill; conduct her. Amarantha dear,From thee I part, rejoicing in thy joy;
Amid thy comforts in a sire's embrace,Or bliss more tender with a destin'd spouse,Forget not me. Autarchus near the tombOf Ariana by these widow'd handsDeposited—She stops; the weaken'd pow'rsOf health relax, nor furnish sound to grief:Mute too is Delphi's maid. The Persian youth,To leave a moment in her sick'ning stateThe princess, feels a struggle, but resolvesIn rapid haste her mandate to obey.Nicaea's gate he enters; Timon soonHe finds: receive thy daughter, swift he spake;Receive thy freedom from the bounteous handOf Xerxes' sister; but a short farewellMy urgent cares allow; to set thee freeAt thy own time I hasten to enjoinThe chief commander here. He said, and turn'dPrecipitate away, unheard, unmark'd
By Timon, who no other voice nor formThan Amarantha's heeds. In Carian steelNow Meliboeus from the gymnic school,Where he was daily exercis'd in arms,Approach'd; to him in transport Timon spake:Behold my daughter!—Instant from the portAppears Aronces, who proclaims the newsOf Artemisia landed. She had leftPhaleron; station'd in the Malian bay,She waits the king's arrival, not remoteNow with his army; all advance to meetThe Carian queen; when sudden clouds of dustThe sky envelop; loud the hollow soundOf trampling hoofs is heard. The portal pass'dBy Artamanes fac'd the southern sun;An entrance eastward rudely is possess'dBy Caspian horsemen, in the hairy skinsOf goats all horrid; round their brawny loins
From shaggy belts keen cimeters depend;Well-furnish'd quivers rattle on their backs.Now fifty grim-fac'd savages dismountTo seize on Amarantha. Then his armNew-train'd to battle Meliboeus proves;With native strength, agility and fire,He springs, confronts the Caspians; from the firstHe lops the ruffian hand; by diff'rent woundsFive more lie prostrate. As a vessel new,Compact and strong, impetuous from the dockIn her first launch divides the troubled waves,On either side recoiling, till the weightOf reuniting waters stops her course,And beats her lofty ribs; so valour drivesThe warrior on, till rallying numbers join'd,Arrest his progress; fearless yet he standsA while defensive. Timon from the deadLifts two forsaken cimeters; both handsHis indignation arms; he sends to hell
Three miscreants gasping at his daughter's feet.With aiding Thefeus, so Pirithous heap'dWith centaurs slain the Lapithaean hall,When in flagitious tumult they deform'dThe nuptial banquet, and his fair espous'dWith violation menac'd. But the eyeOf Amarantha mark'd th' unequal fight;Her poniard drawn, the only succour left,She holds intrepid, resolute on death,No second thraldom; when th' auspicious sightOf Caria's queen revives her fainting hopes.Stern Artemisia, rapid on the callOf vigilant Aronces, now approach'dIn awful tone the Caspians: Sheath your blades,Ye fierce in look, not courage, or this arm(Her falchion here she waves) shall hide these streetsWith your vile carrion. Despicable herdOf rebels, led by what presumptuous fiend
Dare you invade a fortress of your king,Ev'n in my presence, he perhaps in sight?They hear; they pause. Inclos'd by thick'ning guards,In multitude confiding, urg'd by lust,Which lends a courage new, Argestes fell,Inciting loud his ruffians to persist,Strikes her indignant eye. What wrath, what hopesOf just, of long-sought vengeance swell her breast!As when the mother of a lion brood,From wonted chace returning, sees a wolf,Or treach'rous tiger stealing towards her den,Who in her absence would securely preyOn her defenceless whelps, her eyeballs rollIn fire, she rushes on th' insidious foeWith fangs resistless; he contends in vain,His chest she rends asunder, and his heartDevours unsated; so incens'd the queen,
Begirt by Carians terrible in war,To each Barbarian terrible who sawTheir high exploits on Salaminian waves,Rush'd on Argestes; Meliboeus braveMarch'd by her side a second, whom the godOf arms might rank among his foremost sons.The Caspians shrunk; by desperation bold,The satrap spurr'd his courser on the queen,And whirl'd a javelin shiv'ring on her shield;She on the forehead smote the restiff horse,Who, rearing, hurl'd his rider to the ground,Then points her dreadful weapon tow'rds the breastOf her detested foe, intent to pierceThe trait'rous heart. This invocation firstShe solemn utters: Manes of the brave!Whom he devoted on the Malian fieldsUnpitied victims of his hate to me,To you, my subjects, this malignant headI immolate. Hence satrap, once the chief
In pow'r and state, in vice and falsehood chief,Seek Rhadamanthus; tell him, while he frownsOn his tribunal, Themis to my handHer sword resign'd to cut thy treason short.Her vengeance levels now the mortal blow,When dignity restrains her. Rise, she said,Thou criminal, unworthy by this armTo die; preserve him, Carians, to abideThe ignominous lot, by justice doom'dTo common villains. Meliboeus, changeThy name; I clasp thee Haliartus now,My brother, prov'd by gallant deeds; at leastNo evidence but virtue I requireFor nobler union than congenial birth,By friendship's sacred ties to call thee mine.She scarce had finish'd, when a second troopOf horsemen through the southern portal spread
New terror. In their front a splendid chief,Who wears a regal circle; round he castsA searching eye, impatient soon beholdsBright Amarantha, where she stands besetBy Caspians, strangers to their leader's fate,Persisting still in pertinacious strifeAgainst Aronces, and her manly sire;Then swift as sulph'rous ether, when its flameDivides a knotted oak or cleaves a tow'r,Flies on the ruffians: Do ye lift, he cries,Your hands profane against the destin'd queenOf Macedon? a carnage wide he spreadsBeneath his trampling steed and pond'rous blade.Dismounting victor, he unclasps his helm,Her dear betroth'd to Amarantha shewsIn Alexander, Macedonia's king.Ne'er yet so comely, so endearing look'dA lover; rescu'd from Barbarian spoilShe meets his arms, while Timon weeps in joy.With Meliboeus, from a stage of blood,The Carian queen approach'd, while thus the kingHis servent soul was opening: Oh! my love,My Amarantha! my affianc'd love!I feel, but cannot paint, my sorrows past,My present joys. The day, the appointed dayTo solemnize our nuptial rites was nigh,I left my kingdom, flew to Delphi's walls;Thou wast not there. What horror, when I heardThou wast a captive! by what barb'rous handNone could inform me; thence from march to marchI track'd the Persians; tidings of thy fateNo tongue could tell; through Attica I rang'd,Boeotia, Phocis, Doris; Locris stillWas left to search. Disconsolate I join'dThe royal camp last ev'ning; there I heardOf Mithridates by thy virtue slain;At Thebes, of curs'd Argestes, who had heldThee pris'ner there; of thy departure thence
With kind Sandauce to Nicaea's fort;But further told, that base Argestes ledThe Caspian horse forerunners of the host,Alarm'd, my troop I gather'd, I pursu'd,Am come to save thee, nor one hour withholdThe full protection of my nuptial hand.Th' illustrious virgin answer'd in a figh:O Alexander, I am thine, thou mineBy sacred vows; yet thou a foe to Greece!Then Artemisia: Noble maid, I praiseThat zeal for Greece, thy country; but forbearAt this momentous crisis to combineThy preservation with a public care;Thou need'st protection both of rank and pow'r.Few can resist the lustre of thy form,Which, left unguarded thro' the lawless courseOf war, might light, in others less deprav'd
Than foul Argestes and his barb'rous son,New flames to burst in violence again.She ceases; Timon ratifies her words.A mother's office now the queen performsIn preparation for connubial rites;Nor old Aronces, nor th' acknowledg'd heirOf Lygdamis are slow. With human bloodImpure, the streets are cleans'd, the slain remov'd;Flow'rs pluck'd for chaplets, nuptial torches burn,The altars smoke with odours, sternest heartsGrow mild, Bellona's furies sleep forgot,Her fifes and clarions soften to delightThe ear of Hymen; joy concludes the day.End of the Eighth Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the NINTH.SOFT rose the morn, and still; the azure floodIn gentle volumes, undisturb'd with tides,But heav'd by zephyrs, glaz'd the pebbled shore;When Caria's princess, visiting the beachWith Haliartus, and her son belov'd,Her bosom thus disclos'd: O brother! friendIn danger tried, not yet are Asia's woesComplete; to Greece new trophies I forbode.Oh! soon transported o'er these hostile waves,May Artemisia rest her wearied head
At length in peace, and thou, so late redeem'd,With her partake the blessing! Ah! thy looksReject the proffer—yet some rev'rence bearTo Artemisia, some fraternal love.How shall I plead? will haughty Greece admitThee to her honours, thee in humblest state,Tho' meriting the highest, known so long?Halicarnassus, an illustrious town,Among her noblest citizens will rankThe son avow'd of Lygdamis. O castA kindred eye on this my orphan boy!Who must become his guardian, who supplyMy care, should fate precipitate my doom?Tears down the beard of Haliartus flow'd,Afflicted, tho' determin'd. On his handLeander hung; the captivating mienOf Meliboeus had at once allur'dThe tender youth to entertain belief
In old Aronces, when he first proclaim'dThe swain true son of Lygdamis. These wordsFrom Haliartus broke: Thy birth, thy name,Thy virtues, queen, I rev'rence; of thy bloodAcknowledg'd, more ennobled in thy praise,I feel my elevation; but thy earApproving lend. Three suns are now elaps'dSince gen'rous Medon, by a faithful mouth,Convey'd his promise to redeem my head,Exchang'd for splendid captives, by his armIn fight acquir'd; I hourly watch to hailHis peaceful mast, perhaps yon distant keelContains his person. To forsake this friend,Whose kindness bless'd my former humble state,Friend of my childhood, youth, and ripen'd years,Would be an act, O thou of purest fame,To plunge thy brother in the lowest depthOf human baseness, baseness of the mind,Thy long-lost brother, found too soon a stain
To Lygdamis and thee. Concluding here,He eyes the vessel bounding to the port,With branches green of olive on her head,Her poop, and mast; the Carian sailors hailThe fair, pacific signal. On the beachThe warrior leaps, when Haliartus cries,I see my patron! with expanded armsFlies to embrace him. Medon stops, and speaks:In splendid mail is Meliboeus cas'd?Are these not Persian standards flying round?Art thou enroll'd an enemy to Greece?No, interpos'd the queen, behold him free,To thee, to Greece unchang'd, in arms my gift;He is my brother, brother to the queenOf Caria. Medon here: Immortal pow'rs!Do I survey the wonder of her sex,That heroine of Asia, who alone,
While now the fate of empire balanc'd hangs,Contributes virtue to the Persian scale?My friend to such a sister I resign.Ah! never, never, Haliartus cried,Shalt thou resign me; nor th' Oïlean houseWill I forsake; in that belov'd abodeI was too happy for aspiring thoughts.First to redeem thy Locris I devoteThese arms; will perish there before thy foes,If such my fate, if victor in thy ranks,Hang in thy mansion my reposing shield,There make my home. Yet often will I courtThy welcome, princess, on the Carian shoreTo worship still thy virtue, on thy sonStill pour the blessings of parental love.The Carian queen subjoins: I must approve,To such clear honour yield; bring Timon, call
The king; Time presses, we must all depart;A sacred Delphian too from bondage freedThou shalt receive, O Medon. Swift the chiefTo disembark his captives gave command;Five was their number; one beyond the restIn stature tower'd, his armour was unspoil'd,Though rich in burnish'd gold, emboss'd with gemsOf starry light; his dignity and formThe victors rev'renc'd. Medon to the queen:These Aristides, at my efforts pleas'd,Gave to my choice from numbers; an exchangeFor Meliboeus and the Delphian priestThese I design'd; my friends thy bounty frees;Take these unransom'd from a grateful hand.O lib'ral man! the Carian princess here:Thou dost produce Masistius; virtuous lord!How will Mardonius in thy sight rejoice,
How lift his hopes! To her Masistius bow'd,To Medon spake: O Grecian! if a thoughtTo die thy debtor could debase my soul,I should deserve till death all human woes.Demand, obtain; to Asia I am dear,Lov'd by Mardonius, honour'd by the king,I cannot ask what either would refuseTo him who gave me liberty and life.Thou canst, rejoins the chief, obtain a graceTo me of precious worth, to Xerxes none;Nor golden stores nor gems attract my eye;I have a sister, dearer than the minesOf Ind, or wealth of Susa, who residesA priestess pure, on that Oetaean ridgeWhich overlooks Thermopylae, her nameMelissa; there an ancient fane is plac'd,No splendid seat oracular, enrich'dBy proud donations, but a mossy pile,
Where ev'ry Grecian hath from age to ageAdor'd the muses. Lift thy hand to swear,Thou wilt implore of Xerxes a decree,Irrevocable like a Median law,Forbidding all to climb that holy crag.To him Masistius: Not the Delian isle,By Persians held inviolate of old,Shall boast of safety like Melissa's hill;For my performance, lo! I lift my handTo Horomazes. Thou, return'd, saluteAthenian Aristides in my name;From me, his captive in that direful hourOf carnage round Psyttalia's bloody strand,Say, that my thankful tongue will never ceaseExtolling his beneficence and thine.To him far more than liberty and lifeI owe; in bondage precious were the hours,With him the hours of converse, who enlarg'd,
Illum'd my heart and mind; his captive freed,I go a wiser, and a better man.Now with his consort Macedonia's king,And Timon were in sight; a sad'ning lookFair Amarantha mute on Timon fix'd,On her the father: We must part, he said;Alas! too many of thy father's daysCaptivity hath wasted, sorrow moreDeploring thee, my child, while other Greeks,Erecting brilliant trophies, have obtain'dEternal praise. Thee, Amarantha, found,Thee wedded, happy in thy choice and mine,I quit, my tarnish'd honours to retrieve.She then: In him a husband I avowFelicity unstain'd; in him allyTo Persia's tyrant I am left unbless'd.Malignant fortune still pursues thy child;
Before me holds a consort and a sireIn adverse ranks contending. He rejoins:I know thee, daughter, like the manliest GreekThe wrongs of Greece resenting, but thy heartKeep in subjection to a tender spouseOf constancy approv'd, whose house with mine,From eldest times, by mutual tokens pass'dIn sacred hospitality is link'd.Thy pow'r of beauty never for thyselfEmploy, be all compliance; use that charm,As kind occasion whispers, in behalfOf Greece alone; by counsel sweetly breath'd,Diffuse remembrance of his Grecian bloodThro' Alexander's heart. While these converseApart, the keels are launch'd; now all embark;Aboard his vessel Medon leads the sonOf Lygdamis with Timon; on her ownImperial deck th' attentive queen dispos'd
The Macedonian with his beauteous bride,And Persians freed by Medon, chief of theseMasistius merits her peculiar care;Confin'd, Argestes trembles at his doomFrom Xerxes' ire. Along thy rocky verge,Thermopylae, with sails and shrouds relax'd,Smooth glide the Carian gallies thro' a calm,Which o'er the Malian surface sleeps unmov'd,Unless by measur'd strokes of sounding oars,Or foam-besilver'd prows. A royal guard,Preceding Xerxes, through that dreaded passWere then advancing, not in order'd pomp,As on his march to Athens; now behindThe regal chariot panic fear impell'dOn its encumber'd wheels disorder'd throngs,As if Leonidas had ris'n and shookThe snaky shield of Gorgon, or his sword,Stain'd with Psyttalian havoc, o'er their headsThe living arm of Aristides wav'd.
On sight of Oeta Carian's queen relatesTo her illustrious passengers the deedsWhich signaliz'd that rock, nor leaves untoldThe fate of Teribazus, nor the woundOf Ariana, victims both to love.Now, where Spercheos from his spumy jawsA tribute large delivers to the bay,They land; Mardonius, passing tow'rds a tentMagnificent, erected for the king,Arriv'd but newly, on his way perceivesMasistius; transport locks his tongue; he flies,Hangs on his friend, unutterable joyHis tears alone discover. More compos'd,Though not less cordial, with a close embrace,First spake the late redeem'd: Receive thy friend,Whom wreck'd and captive on Psyttalia's isle,An Attic leader, Aristides nam'd,Restores unspoil'd, unransom'd, undisgrac'd!Mardonius quick: Thy unexpected sight,By an Athenian all unsought restor'd,Presages all the good my warmest hopesCould e'er suggest; the omen I enjoy;For this shall Athens, to my friendship won,Possess her laws, her freedom, with increaseOf rich dominion. Artemisia then:Behold, the king of Macedon, his wifeIn Amarantha. Wond'ring at her form,Exclaims the Persian hero; of one crimeI now acquit Argestes and his son;What ice of virtue could resist that face!Again the queen: For other crimes my shipDetains Argestes; him before the kingTo charge, immediate audience we demand.Mardonius guides them to the royal tent.With half his chiefs the monarch anxious sat,
His swift departure by the break of dawnArranging. Amarantha, in her shapeA deity, among them sudden spreadsA blaze of beauty, like the sun at noonIn dazzling state amidst an ether blueOf torrid climates: admiration loudWounds her offended ear. She thus began:What you admire, ye Persians, O that Heav'nHad ne'er conferr'd! the cause of woe to me,Of guilt in others; then a maiden handHad ne'er been dipp'd in slaughter, nor these eyesSurvey'd the pavement of Nicaea strewnWith subjects made rebellious by my fate,Thy subjects, monarch. With a Caspian troopArgestes forc'd thy castle me to seize,Th' affianc'd bride of Macedonia's king,Me, to Sandauce giv'n a royal boon,Me, then in freedom by the gracious will
Of thy imperial sister. Help, unhop'dFrom Artemisia, from my husband came;Me they preserv'd, Argestes pris'ner bringTo undergo thy justice. Caria's queenWith Macedon's indignant prince confirmThis accusation. On his own retreatSecure to Susa Xerxes all intent,Turns to Mardonius: thou be judge, he said;Take to thyself the forfeits of this crime.The king commands his servant shall be judge,Mardonius answer'd; chief among my foesHath been Argestes, therefore must not dieBy my decree. Let Cyra, fort remoteOn Iaxartes hide his banish'd head;That care to Artemisia I commit;His satrapy, his treasure and domainTo Artamanes his remaining son,Thy meritorious vassal, I ordain.This judgment pass'd, a murmur nigh the tent,Denouncing an ambassador, is heard;Ambassador of Sparta. Soon appearsThe manly frame of Aemnestus bold,Surpassing all his countrymen in arms,An Ephorus in office, function high;Whose jealous vigilance imprison'd kingsUnjust, or impious, or assuming pow'rUnwarranted by laws. No train attends;He asks for Xerxes, when Mardonius stern:Before the future sov'reign of the world,With princes round him, single dost thou bringAn embassy from Sparta? Spartans holdOne man with one sufficient in discourse,Cry'd Aemnestus. Xerxes interpos'd:Reveal thy errand, stranger: He reply'd.Admonish'd by an oracle, the state
Of Lacedaemon, and the race divineThere dwelling, sprung from Hercules, demandOf thee atonement for a slaughter'd king,Leonidas, whom multitude oppress'd,While he defended Greece; whate'er thou giv'stI will accept. The monarch to his cheekA shew of laughter calls; awhile is mute;Then, breaking silence, to Mardonius points.They shall receive th' atonement they deserveFrom him: Thou hear'st, Mardonius. Then, with looksOf scorn and menace: Yes, the Spartan said,Thee I accept my victim to appeaseLeonidas; disdainful then his footHe turns away, nor fears th' unnumber'd guard.Meantime the royal progeny is broughtTo Artemisia; urgent time requires,Their Father's fears the embarkation press
For Ephesus that night. Them down the beachMardonius follows, and the Carian queenIn secret thus addresses: Didst thou markThat Spartan's threat'ning words and haughty mien?An oracle suggested this demand,Strange and mysterious. On the martial fieldHim I can single from Laconian ranks,Audacious challenger! but something moreBehind the veil of destiny may lurkUnseen by me. Mardonius, she replied;Look only where no mystery can lurk,On ev'ry manly duty; nothing darkO'ershades the track of virtue; plain her path;But superstition chosen for a guide,Misleads the best and wisest. Think no moreOf this, an object like that passing cloudBefore the moon, who shortly will unfoldHer wonted brightness. Prudent thy designTo gain th' Athenians; to that noble race
Be large in proffers, in performance true;Purchase but their neutrality, thy swordWill, in despight of oracles, reduceThe rest of Greece. This utter'd, she embarks.He seeks his tent, and finds Masistius there,Whose honour, mindful of a promise pledg'd,Requests protection for Melissa's fane.Him in his arms the son of Gobrias clasp'd,Thus fervent answ'ring: Xerxes will renewHis rapid march to-morrow; pow'r supremeHe leaves with me, which instant shall be urg'dTo render firm the promise of my friend.Now lend thy counsel on the copious rollOf Asia's host; assist me to selectThe thirty myriads giv'n to my command.They sat till dayspring; then the camp is mov'd;Then Amarantha, from her husband's tent
Ascends a car, and traverses the vale,By fluent crystal of Spercheos lav'd,To join Sandauce. On her way she meetsArtuchus, guardian of the Persian fair;The satrap gazes, courtesy entranc'dForgets awhile her function. Thus, at length,He greets the queen: Fair stranger, who dost riseA second dayspring to th' astonish'd eye,Accept my service; whither tends thy course?Whom dost thou seek? and gracious tell thy name.In rosy blushes, like Aurora still,She graceful thus: Of Macedonia's kingI am th' espous'd; my patroness I seek,Sandauce, issue of th' imperial house.Artuchus answer'd: Yesternoon beheldHer languid steps approach this vale of woe.Thou, beauteous princess, to Sandauce known,
Thou must have heard of Ariana's fate;Sandauce now is mourning at her tomb,A grave preparing for Autarctus slain.Mayst thou suspend despair! Not distant flowsThe fount of sorrow, so we styl'd the place,Frequented oft by Ariana's grief;There oft her head disconsolate she hungTo feed incessant anguish, ne'er disclos'dUnless in sighing whispers to the stream;Her last abode is there. The myrtles shedTheir odours round, the virgin roses bloom;I there have caus'd a monument to rise,That passing strangers may her name revere,And weep her fortune; from her early graveMay learn, how Heav'n is jealous of its boons,Not long to flourish, where they most excel.A marble mansion new erected nighHer faithful slaves inhabit; who attuneTo thrilling lutes a daily fun'ral song.
He leads, he stops. On gently-moving airSweet measures glide; this melancholy dirge,To melting chords, by sorrow touch'd, is heard.Cropp'd is the rose of beauty in her bud,Bright virtue's purest mansion is defac'd;Like Mithra's beams her silken tresses shoneIn lustre gentle as a vernal morn;Her eye reveal'd the beauties of her mind;The slave, the captive, in her light rejoic'd.Lament, ye daughters of Choaspes, wail,Ye Cissian maids, your paragon is lost!Once like the fresh-blown lily in the vale,In Susa fair, in radiancy of bloomLike summer glowing, till consuming loveDeform'd her graces; then her hue she chang'dTo lilies pining in decay, but keptThe smile of kindness on her wasted cheek.Lament, ye daughters of Choaspes, wail,Ye Cissian maids, your paragon is lost!O ray of wisdom, eye of virtue, form'dTo spread superior light, the dazzling brandOf love malign obscur'd thy eagle sight;Thy vital flames are vanish'd, ours remain,As lamps to endless mourning in thy tomb,Till we rejoin thee in a land of bliss.Lament, ye daughters of Choaspes, wail,Ye Cissian maids, your paragon is lost!The song concludes. Sandauce from a bankOf turf uprises, resting on her slaves;A pallid visage, and a fainting step,She brings before the sepulchre and spake:O Ariana! listen from thy tomb,To me in woe thy sister, as in blood!
By diff'rent fortunes both were doom'd to wasteAn early bloom in sorrow; O admitAutarctus first a neighbour to thy clay,Me next, who feel my vital thread unwind.O Heav'n! my humble spirit would submitTo thy afflicting hand—but ev'ry fountOf health is dry'd; my frame enfeebled sinksBeneath its trial. When the inhuman priestCondemn'd my children to his cruel knife,The freezing sheers of fate that moment cutMy heart-strings; never have they heal'd again;Decay'd and wither'd in the flower of life,My strength deserts my patience: tender friendsProvide another grave.—For whom? bursts forthEmathia's queen, and threw her clasping armsAround the princess; whose discolour'd hueIn warm affection flushes at the sightOf Amarantha, as a languid rose,Shrunk by the rigour of nocturnal frosts,
A while reviving at the tepid raysOf wintry Phoebus, glows. For me, she sigh'd,For me, that bed of endless rest is made.Com'st thou, neglectful of thy nuptial bliss,To poor Sandauce's burial! soon the hour,When of the sun these sickly eyes must takeTheir last farewel, may call thy friendly handTo close their curtains in eternal night!These words the Grecian fair, in sorrow try'd,In constancy unshaken, swift return'd:Thou shalt not die, avoid this mournful spot,Thou hast accomplish'd all thy duty here;Let other duties, wak'ning in thy breast,Strive with despair; transported in my arms,To Alexander's capital resort.Thou shalt not die; returning health, allur'dBy Amarantha's love and tender care,
Again shall bless her patroness, renewHer youth in bloom, in vigour, ne'er to leaveHer infants doubly orphans. At their nameThe princess faints, too sensitive a plant,Which on the lightest touch contracts the leaves,And seems to wither in the fold of death.Her lovely weight Artuchus to his tentConveys; a litter gentle, as it moves,Receives her soon; her children by her side,In Macedonian chariots are dispos'd,Her female slaves and eunuchs. Now appearsEmathia's prince to guard his matchless bride;In arms complete, resembling Mars, he rulesThe fiery courser. Artamanes swiftThis royal mandate to Artuchus bears:The king, O satrap, hath begun his march;Delay not thine with all thy precious charge.To Artamanes then, the Grecian queen:Let me request thee in Sandauce's nameTo visit yonder fount, of sorrow call'd,There see th' unfinish'd obsequies perform'd,To great Autarctus due. Her languid headWith me a while at Aegae will repose,My consort's royal seat; and, gentle youth,If justice whisper to thy feeling heart,That well I sav'd my innocence and fame,Thou wilt be welcome to the Aegaean hall.This said, she mounts her chariot; not unpleas'd,He to accomplish her command proceeds.Artuchus now conducts the female train,Unhappy victims of ambition! These,A prey to famine, to congealing blastsFrom cold Olympus, from Bisaltio hills,And Rhodope, snow-vested, were condemn'd,
With that innumerable host in flightUnform'd, unfurnish'd, scatter'd, to partakeOf miseries surpassing nature's help.On earth's unwholsome lap their tender limbsTo couch, to feed on grass, on bitter leaves,On noisome bark of trees, and swell the sceneBetween Spercheos and the distant shoresOf Hellespontine Sestos: real sceneOf death, beyond the massacre denounc'dBy that stern angel in the prophet's dream,When were assembled ev'ry fowl of preyFrom all the regions of the peopled air,At Heav'ns dread call, to banquet on the fleshOf princes, captains, and of mighty men.End of the Eighth Book.THE ATHENAID.BOOK the TENTH.NOW is the season, when Vertumnus leadsPomona's glowing charms through ripen'd grovesOf ruddy fruitage; now the loaden vineInvites the gath'ring hand, which treasures joyFor hoary winter in his turn to smile.An eastern course before autumnal galesTo Ephesus the Carian gallies bend;While Medon coasts by Locris, and deploresHer state of thraldom. Thrice Aurora shews
Her placid face; devourer of mankind,The sea, curls lightly in fallacious calms;To Medon then the wary master thus:My chief, the dang'rous equinox is nearWhose stormy breath each prudent sailor shuns,Secure in harbour; turbulent these streightsBetween Euboea and the Locrian shore;Fate lurks in eddies, threatens from the rocks;The continent is hostile; we must stretchAcross the passage to Euboea's isle,There wait in safety till the season rudeIts wonted violence hath spent. The chiefReplies: An island, Atalanté nam'd,Possess'd by Locrians, rises in thy view;There first thy shelter seek; perhaps the foeHath left that fragment of my native stateYet undestroy'd. Th' obedient rudder guides,The oars impel the well directed keel
Safe through an inlet op'ning to a coveFenc'd round by rising land. At once the sight,Caught by a lucid aperture of rock,Strays up the island; whence a living stream,Profuse and swift beneath a native arch,Repels encumb'ring sands. A slender skiff,Launch'd from the ship, pervades the sounding vault;With his companions Medon bounds ashore,Addressing Timon: Delphian guest, these steps,Rude hewn, attain the summit of this rock;Thence o'er the island may our wary ken,By some sure sign, discover if we treadA friendly soil, or hostile. They ascend.The topmost peak was chisell'd to displayMarine Palaemon, colossean form,In art not specious. Melicertes once,Him Ino, flying from th' infuriate swordOf Athamas her husband, down a cliff,Distracted mother, with herself immers'd
In ocean's salt-abyss. Their mortal stateNeptunian pity to immortal chang'd;From Ino she became Leucothea, chiefAmong the nymphs of Tethys; he that godBenign, presiding o'er the tranquil port,Palaemon, yielding refuge to the toilsOf mariners sea-worn. One mighty palmLean'd on a rudder, high the other heldA globe of light, far shooting through the dark,In rays auspicious to nocturnal keelsWhich plough the vex'd Euripus. Fair below,Her cap of verdure Atalanté spreads,Small as a region, as a pasture large,In gentle hollows vary'd, gentle swells,All intersected by unnumber'd tuftsOf trees fruit-laden. Bord'ring on the streights,Rich Locris, wide Boeotia, lift their woods,Their hills by Ceres lov'd, and cities fam'd;Here Opus, there Tanagra; Delium shews
Her proud Phoebean edifice, her portCapacious Aulis, whence a thousand barksWith Agamemnon sail'd; a lengthen'd rangeEuboea's rival opulence oppos'd,Queen of that frith; superb the structures riseOf Oreus, Chalcis, and the ruins vastOf sad Erotria, by Darius crush'd.The Locrian chief salutes the figur'd god:Still dost thou stand, Palaemon, to proclaimOïlean hospitality of old,Which carv'd thee here conspicuous, to befriendThe sailor night-perplex'd? Thou only signLeft of Oïlean greatness! wrapp'd in woeIs that distinguish'd house! Barbarians fillHer inmost chambers! O propitious god!If yet some remnant of the Locrian stateThou dost protect on Atalanté's shore,Before I leave her shall thy image smokeWith fattest victims! Timon quick subjoins:I see no hostile traces; numerous hindsAlong the meadows tend their flocks and herds;Let us, descending, and the crested helm,The spear, and shield, committing to our train,In peaceful guise salute a peaceful land.They hear, approving; lightly back they speed;Disarm'd, they follow an inviting path,Which cuts a shelving green. In sportive laugh,Before the threshold of a dwelling nigh,Appear young children; quickning then his pace,O Haliartus, Medon cries, I seeMy brother's offspring! They their uncle knew,Around him flock'd, announcing his approachIn screams of joy: Their sire, Leonteus, came.As Leda's mortal son in Pluto's valeReceiv'd his brother Pollux, who, from JoveDeriv'd, immortal, left the realms of day,
And half his own divinity resign'd,His dear-lov'd Castor to redeem from death;So rush'd Leonteus into Medon's arms,Thus utt'ring loud his transport: Dost thou comeTo me and these a saviour! When that cloudOf dire invasion overcast our land,For sev'n defenceless infants what remain'd?What for a tender mother? Instant flightPreserv'd us; still we unmolested breatheIn Atalanté; others like ourselvesResorted hither; barren winter soonWill blast the scanty produce of this isle,Pale famine waste our numbers; or, by wantCompell'd, this precious remnant of thy friends,These rising pillars of th' Oïlean houseMust yield to Xerxes—but the gods have sentIn thee a guardian. Summon all our friends,Elated Medon answers; ev'ry wantShall be supply'd, their valour in return
Is all I claim. Meantime, like watchful beesTo guard th' invaded hive, from ev'ry partThe Islanders assemble; but the nameOf Medon, once divulg'd, suppresses fear,And wond'ring gladness to his presence bringsTheir numbers. He, rememb'ring such a sceneLate in Calauria, where afflicted throngsAround his righteous friend of Athens press'd;Now in that tender circumstance himselfAmong his Locrians, conscious too of meansTo mitigate their suff'rings, melts in tearsOf joy. O countrymen belov'd! he cries,I now applaud my forecast, which secur'dThe whole Oïlean treasures; safe they lieAt Lacedaemon, whence expect reliefIn full abundance on your wants to flow.Amid his country's ruins Medon stillMay bless the gods; by your auspicious aid,Beyond my hopes discover'd, I may bring
No feeble standard to the Grecian camp,When Athens, now triumphant o'er the waves,With her deep phalanx in the field completesThe overthrow of Asia, and restoresDejected Locris. So to Israel's sons,Their little ones and wives, by deathful thirstAmid the parching wilderness oppress'd,Their legislator, with his lifted rod,Consoling spake, who, Heav'n intrusted, knewOne stroke would open watry veins of rock,And preservation from a flinty bedDraw copious down. Leonteus lead the way,Resum'd his brother: vers'd in arms, my youth,My prime, are strangers to the nuptial tie;Yet, in thy bliss delighting, I would greetA sister, auth'ress of this blooming troop.With all the clust'ring children at his sideHe pass'd the threshold, and their mother hail'd.Now o'er their heads the equinoctial gustsBegin to chace the clouds; by tempests torn,The hoarse Euripus sends a distant sound.Twelve days are spent in sweet domestic joy;Serenity returns. The master warns;Departing Medon reascends the bark,Whose rudder stems the celebrated frith,Where twice sev'n times the sun and stars beholdReciprocating floods. Three days are pass'dWhen Sunium, Attic promontory, shadesThe resting sail; Belbina thence they seekBy morn's new glance, and reach at dewy eve.Athenian too Belbina yields a portTo night-o'ertaken sailors in their courseBetween Cecropia and Troezene's walls.A squadron there is moor'd; Cleander there,Now ev'ry public duty well discharg'dDismiss'd him glorious to his native roof,Was disembark'd. Contemplating in thought
His Ariphilia, for the day's returnHe languish'd; ev'ry Nereid he invok'dTo speed his keel. Him Medon, landing, greets;To whom Cleander: On Calauria firstWe interchang'd embraces; now acceptA salutation doubly warm, O chief!By Aristides pris'd, his second boldIn high exploits, which signalize an isleObscure before, Psyttalia; be my guestThis night at least: He said; they pass'd aboardWith Haliartus and the Delphian seer.A gen'rous meal concluded, Medon spake:Troezenian chief, now give the mind repast;I have been absent long; when first the flightOf Asia's host and shatter'd fleet was known,From Salamis I hoisted sail. To hearOf Aristides and the laurell'd sonOf Neocles, to hear of all the brave,
Whose high achievements consecrate that day,From thy narration would delight my soul.Cleander then began: To council call'dBy Eurybiades, the leading GreeksA while debated, if their fleet combin'dShould sail to break the Hellespontine bridge?This he oppos'd; I readily had join'dTh' Athenian people, eager by themselvesWithout auxiliar Grecians, to pursueThe arrogant invader; but the tribes,In form assembled, with dissuasive words,Themistocles thus cool'd. I oft have seen,Have oftner heard, that vanquish'd men, constrain'dBy desperation, have their loss repair'dIn fight renew'd. Repelling such a cloudOf enemies from Greece, contented rest;The pow'r of gods and heroes, not our own,Achiev'd the deed; pursue not those who fly.
Resort to Athens; in their old abodesReplace your women, such obsequious wives,Such daughters; reinstate your native walls,Rebuild your ruin'd mansions; sow your fields,Prevent a dearth; by early spring unfurlYour active sails, then shake the eastern shores.He last propos'd, that exiles be recall'd.Loud acclamations rose; the honour'd nameOf Aristides thunder'd on the beach.O wise Athenians! Medon cordial here:O happy man, whose happiness is plac'dIn virtuous actions! happiest now a scopeIs giv'n unbounded to thy hand and heart!Proceed Cleander. He his tale renews:Th' Athenians launch their gallies, all embarkWith Aristides, chosen to that charge.
I set my ready canvass to performThe last kind office, from Calauria's isleAnd Troezen's walls to waft their wives and race,Left in our trust. Meantime the diff'rent chiefsMeet on the isthmus, summon'd to decideWho best had serv'd the public, who might claimThe highest honours. Every leader namesHimself the first, but all concurrent ownThemistocles the second. Envy stillPrevails; without decision they disperse,Each to his home. Themistocles incens'd,In eager quest of honours justly due,Withheld unjustly, not to Athens bendsHis hast'ning step, but Sparta ... Medon here:Not so would Aristides—but forgiveMy interrupting voice. The youth pursues:In Athens him I join'd, a people found,Whom fortune never by her frown depress'd,
Nor satisfied with favour. Active all,Laborious, cheerful, they persist in toil,To heave the hills of ruin from their streets,Without repining at their present loss,Intent on future greatness, to be rais'dOn persevering fortitude: The wordOf Aristides guides. Amidst a sceneOf desolation, decency providesThe fun'ral pomp for those illustrious slainAt Salamis; th' insculptur'd tomb I sawPreparing; they already have ordain'dA distant day to solemnize the rites;The mouth of Aristides they decreeTo celebrate the valiant, who have diedFor Athens. While Themistocles acceptsA foreign praise in Sparta, olive crowns,A car selected from the public store,A guard, three hundred citizens high-rank'd,Him through their tracts are chosen to attend,
Excess of rev'rence, by that rigid stateNe'er shewn before. To small Troezene's wallsTo-morrow I return with less renown,With less desert, perhaps to purer bliss.My Ariphilia calls her soldier homeTo give her nuptial hand. My welcome guestYou I invite; the season rude of MarsIs clos'd; new combats will the spring supply;Th' autumnal remnant, winter hov'ring near,Let us possess in peace. Then Timon spake:Young chief, I praise thee; be a husband soon,Be soon a parent; thou wilt bear thy shieldWith constancy redoubled. If defenceOf our forefathers, sleeping in their tombs,So oft unsheaths our swords, more strongly sureTh' endearing, living objects of our loveMust animate the gen'rous, good, and brave.I am unworthy of that praise, in smilesSubjoins the Locrian; but thou know'st, my friend,I have a brother, of a copious streamThe source, he, call'd to battle, shall maintainOïlean fame. Cleander, I am boundTo Lacedaemon; treasure there I left,Which, well exchang'd for nature's foodful gifts,I would transport to Atalanté's shore,Seat of that brother; who, Leonteus nam'd,With brave companions there in refuge lies,A future aid to Greece. A list'ning earCleander yields, while Medon's lips unwindThe varied series of events befall'nHimself and Timon, Amarantha fair,The Carian queen, and Meliboeus chang'dTo Haliartus. By th' immortal godsWe will not sep'rate, fervent cries the youth;My Ariphilia, who is wise and good,Will entertain society like yours,
As Aethiopia, in Maeonian song,Receives to pure and hospitable roofsHer visitants from heav'n. Let youth advise,Not inexperienc'd, but o'er land and seaTo early action train'd; retaining allYour narrative heart-piercing, I perceiveYour wants, and feel impatience to befriend;My lightest keel to Salamis shall bearThy orders, Timon, for the Delphian barks,There left behind you, in Troezene's portTo join you straight. His counsel they accept.The moon is rising, Salamis not far;The will of Timon to his Delphian trainIs swiftly borne. The squadron next proceeds,Passing Troezene by, whose gen'rous chiefAccompanies to shore his Locrian guestAt Cynosura. Spartan is this port,He said; with fifty followers speed thy way;
Commit no treasure to the faithless winds;By land return to find thy ready barks,Well-fill'd from Troezen's stores. They part; he sailsTo joyful welcome on his native shores.When now, unveiling slowly, as she rolls,Her brother's light the moon reflected full,Auspicious period for connubial rites,From Lacedaemon hast'ning, Medon gainsTroezene's ramparts; him Cleander choseHis paranymph to lead the bridal stepsOf Ariphilia. To Calauria's vergeHe pass'd; beneath a nuptial chaplet gayHe wore his crisped hair; of purest whiteA tunic wrapp'd his sinewy chest and loins,A glowing mantle, new in Tyrian dye,Fell down his shoulders. Up the shelving lawnThe high Neptunian structure he attains,Where with her parents Ariphilia waits
Attir'd in roses like her hue, herselfAs Flora fair, or Venus at her birth,When from the ocean with unrifl'd charmsThe virgin goddess sprung. Yet, far unlikeA maid sequester'd from the public eye,She, early train'd in dignity and state,In sanctity of manners to attractA nation's rev'rence, to th' advancing chiefIn sweet composure unreluctant yieldsHer bridal hand, who down the vaulted isle,Where echo joins the hymeneal song,Conducts the fair; before the costly shrine,Perfum'd with incense, and with garlands deck'd,Presents her charms, and thus in manly pray'r:My patron god, from Salamis I come,One of thy naval sons, erecting thereThy recent trophies; let me hence conveyWith thy concurrent smile this precious prize,
Thy sacerdotal virgin. I returnTo thee a pious votary, to herA constant lover; on thy servants pourThy nuptial blessing. Yet, earth-shaking god,Not bound in sloth thy warrior shall repose,Nor languishing obscure in sweetest blissDesert thy glory. Soon as wintry stormsThy nod controls, and vernal breezes courtThe unfurling canvass, my unweary'd helmShall cleave thy floods, till each Barbarian coastAcknowledge thy supremacy, and bowTo Grecian Neptune. Credulous the train,Surrounding, in religious rapture seeThe colossean image of their godSmile on their hero, meriting the smilesOf deities and mortals. Fortune addsHer casual favour; on Cleander's mastTo perch, a pair of turtle doves she sendsFrom Neptune's temple. To his vessel crown'd
With Hymen's wreaths, bestrewn with herbs and flow'rs,Exhaling fragrance, down the slope he guidesHis Ariphilia, priestess now no more.So Hermes, guardian of the Graces, leadsTheir chief, Aglaia, o'er th' Olympian hall,Warn'd by the muses, in preluding strains,The dance on heav'n's bright pavement to begin,And charm the festive gods. The flood repass'd,They, as Troezenian institutes require,The fane of young Hippolytus approach,That victim pure to chastity, who leftOld Theseus childless. From the youthful headsOf both their hair is sever'd, on his shrineTheir maiden off'ring laid. They next ascendAn awful structure, sacred to the Fates,There grateful own that goodness which decreedTheir happy union. To the Graces lastTheir vows are paid, divinities benign,Whom Ariphilia fervent thus invokes:O goddesses, who all its sweetness shedOn human life! whate'er is beauteous here,Illustrious, happy, to your favour owesIts whole endearment; wanting you, our deedsAre cold and joyless. In my husband's eyePreserve me lovely, not in form alone,But that supreme of graces in my sex,Complacency of love. She pray'd; her lookReveal'd, that heav'n would ratify her pray'r.Now in her father's dwelling they remainTill dusky ev'ning. On a bridal car,Constructed rich, the paranymph then seatsThe blooming fair; one side Cleander fills,The other Medon, she between them rides,By torches clear preceded. Lively soundsThe ceremonial music; soon they reachThe bridegroom's mansion; there a feast receivesUnnumber'd friends; the nuptial dance and song
Are now concluded. To her fragrant couchA joyful mother lights the blushing bride;Cleander follows; in the chamber shut,He leaves the guests exulting to reviveTheir song to Hymen, and renew the dance.Three days succeeding were to gymnic featsDevoted; Medon's warlike spear obtainsA second chaplet; Haliartus wonThe wrestler's prize; to hurl the massy diskNone match'd the skill of Timon, still robust,Tho' rev'rend threads of silver had begunTo streak his locks of sable. Southern galesNow call on Medon's laden fleet to sail,Ere winter frowns. With Timon at his side,And Haliartus, in this gentle phraseHis noble host and hostess fair he greets:May ev'ry joy kind wishes can devise,Or language utter, hospitable pair,
Be yours for ever! may a num'rous raceIn virtue grow by your parental care!—With sev'n dear pledges of connubial loveI left a brother, watching my returnIn Atalanté, small, exhausted isle,Which needs my instant succour. Gen'rous friend,To thee I trust my treasure, thou dischargeThe claim of Troezen for th' abundant storesWhich load our vessels; for a time farewell,The vernal sun will see our love renew'd,And swords combin'd against Mardonius bold.He said: the lovely Ariphilia weeps;Cleander sighs, but speeds his parting guests.End of the Tenth Book.
