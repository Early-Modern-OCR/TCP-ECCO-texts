MDCCXXVIII.[Price 1s. 6 d.]To the Right Honourable the
Countess of HERTFORD.MADAM,I HAVE always observed
that, in Addresses of
this Nature, the general
Taste of the World demands
ingenious Turns of Wit, and

disguised artful Periods, instead of
an open Sincerity of Sentiment flowing
in a plain Expression. From
what secret Impatience of the justest
Praise, when bestowed on Others,
this often proceeds, rather than a
pretended Delicacy, is beyond my
Purpose here to enquire. But as nothing
is more foreign to the Disposition
of a Soul sincerely pleased
with the Contemplation of what is
beautiful, and excellent, than Wit and
Turn; I have too much Respect for
your Ladyship's Character, either to
touch it in that gay, trifling Manner,
or venture on a particular Detail

of those truly amiable Qualities of
which it is composed. A Mind exalted,
pure, and elegant, a Heart
overflowing with Humanity, and the
whole Train of Virtues thence derived,
that give a pleasing Spirit to
Conversation, an engaging Simplicity
to the Manners, and form the Life
to Harmony, are rather to be felt,
and silently admired, than expressed.
I have attempted, in the following
Poem, to paint some of the most
tender Beauties, and delicate Appearances
of Nature; how much in vain,
your Ladyship's Taste will, I am
afraid, but too soon discover: Yet

would it still be a much easier Task
to find Expression for all that Variety
of Colour, Form, and Fragrance,
which enrich the Season I
describe, than to speak the many
nameless Graces, and Native Riches
of a Mind capable so much at once
to relish Solitude, and adorn Society.
To whom then could these
Sheets be more properly inscribed
than to You, MADAM, whose Influence
in the World can give them
the Protection they want, while
your fine Imagination, and intimate
Acquaintance with Rural Nature, will
recommend them with the greatest

Advantage to your favourable Notice?
Happy! if I have hit any
of those Images, and correspondent
Sentiments, your calm Evening
Walks, in the most delightful
Retirement, have oft inspired. I
could add too, that as this Poem
grew up under your Encouragement,
it has therefore a natural
Claim to your Patronage. Should
You read it with Approbation, it's
Musick shall not droop; and should
it have the good Fortune to deserve
your Smiles, it's Roses shall
not wither. But, where the Subject
is so tempting, lest I begin

my Poem before the Dedication is
ended, I here break short, and beg
Leave to subscribe my self, with
the highest Respect,MADAM,Your most Obedient,
Humble Servant,
JAMES THOMSON.ADVERTISEMENT.THAT the following Poem appears at present
in Publick, is not any way in Prejudice of
the Proposals I lately Published for Printing the
FOUR SEASONS, &c. by Subscription, but
at the Solicitation of some of my Friends who
had seen it in Manuscript, and the better to
carry on a Work I stand engaged to finish.
For Subscription is now at its last Gasp,
and the World seems to have got the better of
that many-headed Monster. However, those
Gentlemen and Ladies who have been, or
may hereafter be so good as to honour me
with their Names, shall have the Book next
Winter according to my Proposals: And if
it should, in any Degree, be judged worthy their
Encouragement, I have my best Reward.SPRING.
A
POEM.COME, gentle SPRING, Aetherial Mildness,
come,And from the Bosom of yon dropping Cloud,While Music wakes around, veil'd in a ShowerOf shadowing Roses, on our Plains descend.OH HERTFORD, fitted, or to shine in CourtsWith unaffected Grace, or walk the Plain,With Innocence, and Meditation join'dIn soft Assemblage, listen to my Song,
Which thy own Season paints, when Nature allIs blooming, and benevolent like Thee.AND see where surly WINTER passes off,Far to the North, and calls his ruffian Blasts;His Blasts obey, and quit the howling Hill,The shatter'd Forest, and the ravag'd Vale:While softer Gales succeed, at whose kind Touch,Dissolving Snows in sudden Torrents lost,The Mountains lift their green Heads to the Sky.As yet the trembling Year is unconfirm'd,And Winter oft at Eve resumes the Breeze,Chills the pale Morn, and bids his driving SleetsDeform the Day delightless; so that scarceThe Bittern knows his Time, with Bill ingulphtTo shake the sounding Marsh; or from the ShoreThe Plovers theirs, to scatter o'er the Heath,And sing their wild Notes to the listening Waste.At last from Aries rolls the bounteous Sun,And the bright Bull receives Him. Then no moreTh' expansive Atmosphere is cramp'd with Cold,But full of Life, and vivifying Soul,Lifts the light Clouds sublime, and spreads them thin,Fleecy, and white, o'er All-surrounding Heaven.FORTH fly the tepid Aires; and unconfin'd,Unbinding Earth, the moving Softness strays.Joyous th' impatient Husbandman perceivesRelenting Nature, and his lusty SteersDrives from their Stalls, to where the well-us'd PlowLies in the Furrow loosen'd from the Frost.There, unrefusing to the harness'd yoke,They lend their Shoulder, and begin their Toil,Chear'd by the simple Song, and soaring Lark.Mean-while incumbent o'er the shining ShareThe Master leans, removes th' obstructing Clay,Winds the whole Work, and side-long lays the Glebe.
WHITE thro' the neighbring Fields the Sower
stalks,With measur'd Step, and liberal throws the GrainInto the faithful Bosom of the Earth.The Harrow follows harsh, and shuts the Scene.BE gracious, Heaven! for now laborious ManHas done his Due. Ye fostering Breezes blow!Ye softening Dews, ye tender Showers descend!And temper all, thou influential Sun,Into the perfect Year! Nor, Ye who liveIn Luxury and Ease, in Pomp and Pride,Think these lost Themes unworthy of your Ear.'Twas such as these the Rural Maro sungTo the full Roman Court, in all it's heightOf Elegance and Taste. The sacred PlowEmploy'd the Kings and Fathers of Mankind,In antient Times. And Some, with whom compar'dYou're but the Beings of a Summer's Day,Have held the Scale of Justice, shook the Launce
Of mighty War, then With descending Hand,Unus'd to little Delicacies, feiz'dThe Plow, and greatly independant liv'd.YE generous Britons cultivate the Plow!And o'er your Hills, and long with-drawing Vales,Let Autumn spread his Treasures to the Sun,Luxuriant, and unbounded. As the Sea,Far thro' his azure, turbulent Extent,Your Empire owns, and from a thousand ShoresWafts all the Pomp of Life into your Ports,So with superior Boon may your rich Soil,Exuberant, Nature's better Blessings pourO'er every Land; the naked Nations cloath.And be th' exhaustless Granary of the World.NOR thro' the lenient Air alone, this ChangeDelicious breathes; the penetrative Sun,His Force deep-darting to the dark RetreatOf Vegetation, sets the steaming Power
At large, to wander o'er the vernant EarthIn various Hues, but chiefly Thee, gay Green!Thou smiling Nature's universal Robe!United Light and Shade! where the Sight dwellsWith growing Strength, and ever-new Delight!FROM the moist Meadow to the brown-brow'd Hill,Led by the Breeze, the vivid Verdure runs,And swells, and deepens to the cherish'd Eye.The Hawthorn whitens; and the juicy GrovesPut forth their Buds, unfolding by Degrees,Till the whole leafy Forest stands display'dIn full Luxuriance, to the sighing Gales,While the Deer rustle thro' the twining Brake,And the Birds sing conceal'd. At once array'dIn all the Colours of the flushing Year,By Nature's swift and secret-working Hand,The Garden glows, and fills the liberal AirWith lavish Fragrance; while the promis'd FruitLies yet a little Embrio, unperceiv'd,
Within it's Crimson Folds. Now from the TownBuried in Smoak, and Sleep, and noisome Damps,Oft let me wander o'er the dewy Fields,Where Freshness breathes, and dash the lucid DropsFrom the bent Bush, as thro' the fuming MazeOf Sweet-Briar Hedges I pursue my Walk;Or taste the Smell of Dairy; or ascendSome Eminence, Augusta, in thy Plains,And see the Country far-diffus'd aroundOne boundless Blush, one snow-empurpled ShowerOf mingled Blossoms, where the raptur'd EyeTravels from Joy to Joy, and, hid beneathThe fair Profusion, yellow Autumn spies.IF brush'd from Russian Wilds a cutting GaleRise not, and scatter from his foggy WingsThe bitter Mildew, or dry-blowing breatheUntimely Frost; before whose baleful Blast,The full-blown Spring thro' all her Foliage shrinks.Into a smutty, wide-dejected Waste.
For oft engender'd by the hazy North,Myriads on Myriads, Insect-Armies waftKeen in the poison'd Breeze; and wasteful eatThro' Buds, and Bark, even to the Heart of OakTheir eager Way. A feeble Race! scarce seen,Save to the prying Eye; yet Famine waitsOn their corrosive Course, and starves the Year.Sometimes o'er Cities as they steer their Flight,Where rising Vapour melts their Wings away,Gaz'd by th' astonish'd Crowd, the horrid ShowerDescends. And hence the skillful Farmer ChaffAnd blazing Straw before his Orchard burns,Till all involv'd in Smoak the latent FoeFrom every Cranny suffocated falls;Or Onions steaming hot beneath his TreesExposes, fatal to the frosty Tribe:Nor, from their friendly Task, the busy BillOf little trooping Birds instinctive scares.THESE are not idle Philosophic Dreams;Full Nature swarms with Life. Th' unfaithful Fen
In putrid Steams emits the living CloudOf Pestilence. Thro' subterranean Cells,Where searching Sun-Beams never found a Way,Earth animated heaves. The flowery LeafWants not it's soft Inhabitants. The Stone,Hard as it is, in every winding PoreHolds Multitudes. But chief the Forest-Boughs,Which dance unnumber'd to th' inspiring Breeze,The downy Orchard, and the melting PulpOf mellow Fruit the nameless Nations feedOf evanescent Insects. Where the PoolStands mantled o'er with Green, invisible,Amid the floating Verdure Millions stray.Each Liquid too, whether of acid Taste,Milky, or strong, with various Forms abounds.Nor is the lucid Stream, nor the pure Air,Tho' one transparent Vacancy they seem,Devoid of theirs. Even Animals subsistOn Animals, in infinite Descent;And all so fine adjusted, that the Loss
Of the least Species would disturb the whole.Stranger than this th' inspective Glass confirms,And to the Curious gives th' amazing ScenesOf lessning Life; by Wisdom kindly hidFrom Eye, and Ear of Man: for if at onceThe Worlds in Worlds enclos'd were push'd to Light,Seen by his sharpen'd Eye, and by his EarIntensely bended Heard, from the choice Cate,The freshest Viands, and the brightest Wines,He'd turn abhorrent, and in Dead of Night,When Silence sleeps o'er all, be stun'd with Noise.THE North-East spends his Rage, and now shut upWithin his Iron Caves, th' effusive SouthWarms the wide Air, and o'er the Void of HeavenBreathes the big Clouds with vernal Showers distent.At first a dusky Wreath they seem to rise,Scarce staining Aether; but by fast Degrees,In Heaps on Heaps, the doubling Vapour sailsAlong the loaded Sky, and mingling thickSits on th' Horizon round a settled Gloom.
Not such as wintry Storms on Mortals shedOppressing Life, but lovely, gentle, kind,And full of every Hope, and every Joy,The Wish of Nature. Gradual sinks the BreezeInto a perfect Calm; that not a BreathIs heard to quiver thro' the closing Woods,Or rustling turn the many-twinkling LeavesOf Aspin tall. Th' uncurling Floods, diffus'dIn glassy Breadth, seem thro' delusive LapseForgetful of their Course.'Tis Silence all,And pleasing Expectation. Herds and FlocksDrop the dry Sprig, and mute-imploring eyeThe falling Verdure. Hush'd in short SuspenseThe plumy People streak their Wings with Oil,And wait th' approaching Sign to strike at onceInto the general Choir. Ev'n Mountains, Vales,And Forests seem expansive to demandThe promis'd Sweetness, Man superior walksAmid the glad Creation, musing Praise,And looking lively Gratitude. At last
The Clouds consign their Treasures to the Fields,And, softly shking on the dimply PoolPrelusive Drops, let all their Moisture flowIn large Effusion o'er the freshen'd World.'Tis scarce to patter heard, the stealing Shower,By such as wander thro' the Forest-Walks,Beneath th' umbrageous Multitude of Leaves.But who would hold the Shade, while Heaven descendsIn universal Bounty, shedding Herbs,And Fruits, and Flowers, on Nature's ample Lap?Imagination fir'd prevents their Growth,And while the verdant Nutriment distills,Beholds the kindling Country colour round,THUS all Day long the full-distended CloudsIndulge their genial Stores, and well-showr'd EarthIs deep enrich'd with vegetable Life;Till, in the Western Sky, the downward SunLooks out illustrious from amid the FlushOf broken Clouds, gay-shifting to his Beam.
The rapid Radiance instantaneous strikesTh' illumin'd Mountain, thro' the Forest streams,Shakes on the Floods, and in a yellow Mist,Far-smoaking o'er th' interminable Plain,In twinkling Myriads lights the dewy Gems.Moist, bright, and green, the Landskip laughs around.Full swell the Woods; their every Musick wakes,Mix'd in wild Consort with the warbling BrooksIncreas'd, th' unnumber'd Bleatings of the Hills,The hollow Lows responsive from the Vales,Whence blending all the sweeten'd Zephir springs.Mean-time retracted from yon Eastern Cloud,Bestriding Earth, the grand aetherial BowShoots up immense! and every Hue unfolds,In fair Proportion, running from the Red,To where the Violet fades into the Sky.Here, mighty Newton, the dissolving CloudsAre, as they scatter round, thy numerous Prism,Untwisting to the Philosophic EyeThe various Twine os Light, by Thee pursu'd
Thro' all the mingling Maze. Not so the Swain,He wondering views the bright Enchantment bend,Delightful, o'er the radiant Fields, and runsTo catch the falling Glory, but amaz'dBeholds th' amusive Arch before him fly,Then vanish quite away. Still Night succeeds,A soften'd Shade; and saturated EarthAwaits the Morning Beam, to give again,Transmuted soon by Nature's Chymistry,The blooming Blessings of the former Day.THEN spring the living Herbs, profusely wildO'er all the deep-green Earth, beyond the PowerOf Botanist▪ to number up their Tribes;Whether he steals along the lonely DaleIn silent Search; or thro' the Forest, rankWith what the dull Incurious Weeds account,Bursts his blind Way; or climbs the Mountain-Rock,Fir'd by the nodding Verdure of its Brow.With such a liberal Hand has Nature slung
Their Seeds abroad, blown them about in Winds,Innumerous mix'd then with the nursing Mold,The moistening Current, and prolific Rain.BUT who their Virtues can declare? who pierceWith holy Eye into these secret StoresOf Life, and Health, and Joy? The Food of ManWhile yet he liv'd in Innocence, and toldA Length of golden Years, unflesh'd in Blood,A Stranger to the Savage Arts of Life,Death, Rapine, Carnage, Surfeit, and Disease,The Lord, and not the Tyrant of the World.THEN the glad Morning wak'd the gladden'd RaceOf uncorrupted Men, nor blush'd to seeThe Sluggard sleep beneath her sacred Beam.For their light Slumbers gently fum'd away,And up they rose as vigorous as the Sun,Or to the Culture of the willing Glebe,Or to the chearful Tendance of the Flock.
Mean-time the Song went round; and Dance, and Sport,Wisdom, and friendly Talk successive stoleTheir Hours away. While in the rosy ValeLove breath'd his Infant Sighs, from Anguish free,Fragrant with Bliss, and only wept for Joy.Nor yet injurious Act, nor surly DeedWas known among these happy Sons of Heaven;For Reason and Benevolence were Law.Harmonious Nature too look'd smiling on.Clean shone the Skies, cool'd with eternal Gales,And balmy Spirit all. The youthful SunShot his best Rays; and still the gracious CloudsDrop'd Fatness down; as o'er the swelling MeadThe Herds and Flocks commixing play'd secure.Which when, emergent from the gloomy Wood,The glaring Lyon saw, his horrid HeartWas meeken'd, and he join'd his sullen Joy.For Musick held the whole in perfect Peace:Soft sigh'd the Flute; the tender Voice was heardWarbling the joyous Heart; the Woodlands round
Apply'd their Quire; and Winds and Waters flow'dIn Consonance.—Such were these Prime of Days.THIS to the Poets gave the golden Age;When, as they sung in Allegoric Phraze,The Sailor-Pine had not the Nations yetIn Commerce mix'd; for every Country teem'dWith every Thing. Spontaneous Harvests wav'dStill in a Sea of yellow Plenty round.The Forest was the Vineyard, where untaughtTo climb, unprun'd, and wild, the juicy GrapeBurst into Floods of Wine. The knotted OakShook from his Boughs the long transparent StreamsOf Honey, creeping thro' the matted Grass.Th' uncultivated Thorn a ruddy ShowerOf Fruitage shed, on such as sat below,In blooming Ease, and from brown Labour free,Save what the copious Gathering, grateful, gave.The Rivers foam'd with Nectar; or diffuse,Silent, and soft, the milky Maze devolv'd.
Nor had the spongy, full-expanded FleeceYet drunk the Tyrian Die. The stately RamShone thro' the Mead, in native Purple clad,Or milder Saffron; and the dancing LmbThe vivid Crimson to the Sun disclos'd.Nothing had Power to hurt; the savage Soul,Yet untransfus'd  the Tyger's Heart,Burn'd not his Bowels, nor his gamesome PawDrove on the fleecy Partners of his Play:While from the flowery Brake the Serpent roll'dHis fairer Spires, and play'd his pointless Tongue.BUT now what-e'er these gaudy Fables meant,And the white Minutes that they shadow'd out,Are found no more amid these Iron Times,These Dregs of Life! in which the Human MindHas lost that Harmony ineffable,Which forms the Soul of Happiness; and allIs off the Poise within; the Passions allHave burst their Bounds; and Reason half extinct,
Or impotent, or else approving, seesThe foul Disorder. Anger storms at large,Without an equal Cause; and fell RevengeSupports the falling Rage. Close Envy bitesWith venom'd Tooth; while weak, unmanly Fear,Full of frail Fancies, loosens every Power.Even Love itself is Bitterness of Soul,A pleasing Anguish pining at the Heart.Hope sickens with Extravagance; and Grief,Of Life impatient, into Madness swells,Or in dead Silence wastes the weeping Hours.These, and a thousand new Emotions more,That from their Mixture spring, distract the MindWith endless Tumult. Whence resulting riseThe selfish Thought, a listless Inconcern,Cold, and averting from our Neighbour's Good;Then dark Disgust, and Malice, winding Wiles,Sneaking Deceit, and Coward Villany:At last unruly Hatred, lewd Reproach,Convulsive Wrath, and thoughtless Fury quick
To every evil Deed. Even Nature's selfIs deem'd vindictive, to have chang'd her Course.HENOE in old Time, they say, a Deluge came;When the dry-crumbling Orb of Earth, which arch'dTh' imprison'd Deep around, impetuous rush'd,With Ruin inconceivable, at onceInto the Gulph, and o'er the highest HillsWide-dash'd the Waves, in Undulation vast:Till from the Centre to the streaming CloudsA shoreless Ocean tumbled round the Globe.THE Seasons since, as hoar Tradition tells,Have kept their constant Chace; the Winter keenPour'd out his Waste of Snows, and Summer shotHis pestilential Heats: great Spring beforeGreen'd all the Year; and Fruits and Blossoms blush'dIn social Sweetness on the self-same Bough.Clear was the temperate Air; an even CalmPerpetual reign'd, save what the Zephirs bland
Breath'd o'er the blue Expanse; for then nor StormsWere taught to blow, nor Hurricanes to rage;Sound slept the Waters: no sulphureous GloomsSwell'd in the Sky, and sent the Lightning forth:While sickly Damps, and cold Autumnal FogsSat not pernicious on the Springs of Life.But now from clear to cloudy, moist to dry,And hot to cold, in restless Change revolv'd,Our droopipg Days are dwindled down to nought,The fleeting Shadow of a Winter's Sun.AND yet the wholesome Herb neglected diesIn lone Obscurity, unpriz'd for Food,Altho' the pure, exhilerating SoulOf Nutriment, and Health, salubrious breathes,By Heaven infus'd, along it's secret Tubes.For, with hot Ravine fir'd, ensanguin'd ManIs now become the Lyon of the Plain,And worse. The Wolf, who from the nightly FoldFierce-drags the bleating Prey, ne'er drunk her Milk,
Nor Wore her warming Fleece: nor has the Steer,At whose strong Chest the deadly Tyger hangs,E'er plow'd for him. They too are temper'd high,With Hunger stung, and wild Necessity,Nor lodges Pity in their shaggy Breasts.But Man, whom Nature form'd of milder Clay,With every kind Emotion in his Heart,And taught alone to weep; while from her LapShe pours ten thousand Delicacies, Herbs,And Fruits as numerous as the drops of Rain,And Beams which gave them Birth: shall He, fair Form!Who wears sweet Smiles, and looks erect on Heaven,E'er stoop to mingle with the prowling Herd,And dip his Tongue in Blood? The Beast of Prey,'Tis true, deserves the Fate in which He deals;Him from the Thicket let the hardy YouthProvoke, and foaming thro' th' awakened WoodsWith every Nerve pursue. But You, ye Flocks,What have ye done? ye peaceful People, what,To merit Death? You, who have given us Milk
In luscious Streams, and lent us your own CoatAgainst the Winter's Cold; whose UsefulnessIn living only lies. And the plain Ox,That harmless, honest, guileless Animal,In what has He offended? He, whose Toil,Patient, and ever-ready, cloaths the FieldsWith all the Pomp of Harvest; shall He bleed,And wrestling groan beneath the cruel HandsEven of the Clowns he feeds? And that perhapsTo swell the Riot of the gathering Feast,Won by his Labour. Thus the feeling HeartWould tenderly suggest. But 'tis enough,In this late Age, adventurous to have touch'dLight on the Numbers of the Samian Sage.High Heaven beside forbids the daring Strain,Whose wisest Will has fix'd us in a State,Which must not yet to pure Perfection rise.BUT yonder breathing Prospect bids the MuseThrow all her Beauty forth, that Daubing all
Will be to what I gaze; for who can paintLike Nature? Can Imagination boastAmid his gay Creation Hues like Her's?And can He mix them with that matchless Skill,And lay them on so delicately sweet,And lose them in each other, as appearsIn every Bud that blows? If Fancy thenUnequal fails beneath the lovely Task;Ah what shall Language do? Ah where find WordsTing'd with so many Colours? And whose PowerTo Life approaching, may perfume my LaysWith that fine Oil, these aromatic Gales,Which inexhaustive flow continual round.YET, tho' successless, will the Toil delight.Come then ye Virgins, and ye Youths, whose HeartsHave felt the Raptures of refining Love,Oh come, and while the rosy-footed MaySteals blushing on, together let us walkThe Morning Dews, and gather in their Prime
Fresh-blooming Flavours, to deck the flowing Hair,And for a Breast which can improve their Sweets.SEE, where the winding Vale her lavish Stores,Irriguous, spreads. See, how the Lilly drinksThe latent Rill, scarce oozing thro' the GrassOf Growth luxuriant, or the humid BankProfusely climbs. Turgent, in every PoreThe Gummy Moisture shines, new Lustre lends,And feeds the Spirit that diffusive roundRefreshes all the Dale. Long let us walk,Where the Breeze blows from yon extended FieldOf blossom'd Beans; Arabia cannot boastA fuller Gale of Joy than, liberal, thenceBreathes thro' the Sense, and takes the ravish'd Soul.Nor is, the Meadow worthless of our Foot,Full of fresh Verdure, and unnumber'd Flowers,The Negligence of Nature, wide, and wild,Where, undisguis'd by mimic Art, she showsUnbounded Beauty to the boundless Eye.
'Tis here that their delicious Task the Bees,In swarming Millions, tend. Around, athwart,This Way and that, the busy Nations fly,Cling to the Bud, and, with inserted Tube,It's Soul, it's Sweetness, and it's Manna suck.The little Chymist thus, all-moving HeavenHas taught. And oft, of bolder Wing, he daresThe Purple Heath, or where the Wild-Thyme growAnd yellow loads him with the luscious Spoil.AT length the finish'd Garden to the ViewIt's Vistas opens, and it's Alleys green.Snatch'd thro' the verdant Maze, the hurried EyeDistracted wanders; now the bowery WalkOf Covert close, where scarce a Speck of DayFalls on the lengthen'd Gloom, protracted darts;Now meets the bending Sky, the River nowDimpling along, the breezy-ruffled Lake,The Forest running round, the rising Spire,Th' aetherial Mountain, and the distant Main.
But why so far excursive? When at Hand,Along the blushing Borders, dewy-bright,And in yon mingled Wilderness of Flowers,Fair-handed Spring unbosoms every Grace;Throws out the Snow-Drop, and the Crocus first,The Daisy, Primrose, Violet darkly blue,Soft-bending Cowslips, and of nameless DiesAnemonies, Auriculas, a TribePeculiar powder'd with a shining Sand,Renunculas, and Iris many-hued.Then comes the Tulip-Race, where Beauty playsHer gayest Freaks; from Family diffus'dTo Family, as flies the Father-Dust,The varied Colours run; and while they breakOn the charm'd Florist's Eye, he wondering stands,And new-flush'd Glories all ecstatic marks.Nor Hyacinths are wanting, nor JunquilsOf potent Fragrance, nor Narcissus white,Nor deep Carnations, nor enamel'd Pinks,And showr'd from every Bush the Damask-Rose.
Infinite Numbers, Delicacies, Smells,With Hues on Hues Expression cannot paint,The Breath of Nature, and her endless Bloom.HAIL, Mighty Being! Universal SoulOf Heaven and Earth! Essential Presence, hail!To Thee I bend the Knee, to Thee my ThoughtsContinual climb, who, with a Master-Hand,Hast the great Whole into Perfection touch'd.By Thee the various vegetative Tribes,Wrapt in a filmy Net, and clad with Leaves,Draw the live Aether, and imbibe the Dew.By Thee dispos'd into cogenial SoilsStands each attractive Plant, and sucks, and swellsThe juicy Tide, a twining Mass of Tubes.At Thy Command, the vernal Sun awakesThe torpid Sap, detruded to the RootBy Wintry Winds, that now, in fluent DanceAnd lively Fermentation, mounting, spreadsAll this innumerous-colour'd Scene of things.ASCENDING from the vegetable WorldTo higher Life, with equal Wing ascend,My panting Muse; and hark, how loud the WoodsInvite you forth in all your gayest Trim.Lend me your Song, ye Nightingales! oh poutThe mazy-running Soul of MelodyInto my varied Verse! while I deduce,From the first Note the hollow Cuckoo sings,The Symphony of Spring, and touch a ThemeUnknown to Fame, the Passion of the Groves.JUST as the Spirit of Love is sent abroad,Warm thro' the vital Air, and on their HeartsHarmonious seizes, the gay Troops beginIn gallant Thought to plume their painted Wings;And try again the long-forgotten Strain,At first faint-warbled. But no sooner growsThe soft Infusion prevalent, and wide,Than all alive at once their Joy o'erflowsIn Music unconfin'd. Up-springs the Lark,
Shrill-voiced, and loud, the Messenger of Morn;Ere yet the Shadows fly, He mounted singsAmid the dawning Clouds, and from their HauntsCalls up the tuneful Nations. Every CopseThick-wove, and Tree irregular, and Bush,Bending with dewy Moisture o'er the HeadsOf the coy Quiristers that lodge within,Are prodigal of Harmony. The Thrush,And Wood-Lark, o'er the kind-contending ThrongSuperior heard, run thro' the sweetest LengthOf Notes, when listening Philomela deignsTo let them joy, and purposes, in ThoughtElate, to make her Night excel their Day.The Black-bird whistles from the thorny Brake;The mellow Bull-finch answers from the Grove:Nor are the Linnets, o'er the flowering Furze,Pour'd out profusely, silent. Join'd to These,Thousands beside, thick as the covering LeavesThey warble under, or the nitid HuesWhich speck them o'er, their Modulations mix
Mellifluous. The Jay, the Rook, the Daw,And all these jangling Pipes, when heard alone,Here aid the Consort: while the Wood-Dove breathesA melancholy Murmur thro' the whole.'Tis Love creates their Gaiety, and allThis Waste of Music is the Voice of Love;Which even to Birds, and Beasts, the tender ArtsOf Pleasing teaches. Hence the glossy KindTry every winning Way inventive LoveCan dictate, and in fluttering Courtship pourTheir little Souls before Her. Wide around,Respectful, first in airy Rings they rove,Endeavouring by a thousand Tricks to catchThe cunning, conscious, half-averted GlanceOf their regardless Charmer. Should she seemSoftening the least Approvance to bestow,Their Colours burnish, and by Hope inspir'dThey brisk advance; then on a sudden struckRetire disorder'd; then again approach,
And throwing out the last Efforts of Love,In fond Rotation spread the spotted Wing,And shiver every Feather with Desire.CONNUBIAL Leagues agreed, to the deep WoodsThey haste away, each as their Fancy leads,Pleasure, or Food, or latent Safety prompts;That Nature's great Command may be obey'd,Nor all these sweet Sensations they perceiveIndulg'd in vain. Some to the Holly-HedgeNestling repair, and to the Thicket some;Some to the rude Protection of the ThornResolve to trust their Young. The clefted TreeOffers it's kind Concealment to a Few,Their Food it's Insects, and it's Moss their Nests.Others apart far in the grassy DaleTheir humble Texture weave. But most delightIn unfrequented Glooms, or shaggy Banks,Steep, and divided by a babbling Brook,Whose Murmurs sooth them all the live-long Day,
When for a Season fix'd. Among the RootsOf Hazel, pendant o'er the plaintive Stream,They frame the first Foundation of their Domes,Dry Sprigs of Trees, in artful Manner laid,And bound with Clay together. Now 'tis noughtBut Hurry Hurry thro' the busy Air,Beat by unnumber'd Wings. The Swallow sweepsThe slimy Pool, to build his hanging HouseIngeniously intent. Oft from the BackOf Herds and Flocks a thousand tugging BillsPluck Hair, and Wool, and oft when unobserv'dSteal from the Barn the Straw; till soft, and warm,Clean, and compleat, their Habitation grows.MEAN-TIME the patient Dam assiduous sits,Not to be tempted from her tender Task,Or by sharp Hunger, or by smooth Delight,Tho' the whole loosen'd Spring around her blows,Her sympathizing Lover takes his StandHigh on th' opponent Bank, and ceaseless sings
The tedious Time away; or else suppliesHer Place a Moment, while she sudden flitsTo pick the scanty Meal. Th' appointed TimeWith pious Toil fulfill'd, the callow YoungWarm'd, and expanded into perfect Life,Their brittle Bondage break, and come to Light,A helpless Family, demanding FoodWith constant Clamour. Oh what Passions then,What melting Sentiments of kindly CareSeize the new Parents' Hearts! Away they flyAffectionate, and undesiring bearThe most delicious Morsel to their Young,Which equally distributed, againThe Search begins. So pitiful, and poor,A gentle Pair on Providential HeavenCast, as they weeping eye their clamant Train,Check their own Appetites, and give them all.NOR is the Courage of the fearful Kind,Nor is their Cunning less, should some rude Foot
Their Woody Haunts molest; stealthy asideInto the Centre of a neighbring BushThey drop, and whirring thence alarm'd, deceiveThe rambling School-Boy. Hence around the HeadOf Traveller, the white-wing'd Plover wheelsHer sounding Flight, and then directly onIn long Excursion skims the level Lawn,To tempt you from her Nest. The Wild-Duck henceO'er the rough Moss, and o'er the trackless WasteThe Heath-Hen flutters, as if hurt, to leadThe hot, pursuing Spaniel far astray.BE not the Muse asham'd, here to bemoanHer Brothers of the Grove, by Tyrant ManInhuman caught, and in the narrow CageFrom Liberty confin'd, and boundless Air.Dull are the pretty Slaves, their Plumage dull,Ragged, and all it's brightning Lustre lost;Nor is that luscious Wildness in their NotesThat warbles from the Beech. Oh then desist,
Ye Friends of Harmony! this barbarous ArtForbear, if Innocence and Music canWin on your Hearts, or Piety perswade.BUT let not chief the Nightingale lamentHer ruin'd Care, too delicately fram'dTo brook the harsh Confinement of the Cage.Oft when returning with her loaded Bill,Th' astonish'd Mother finds a vacant Nest,By the hard Hands of unrelenting ClownsRob'd, to the Ground the vain Provision falls;Her Pinions ruffle, and low-drooping scarceCan bear the Mourner to the Poplar Shade,Where all-abandon'd to Despair she singsHer Sorrows thro' the Night; and, on the BoughSad-sitting, still at every dying FallTakes up again her lamentable StrainOf winding Woe, till wide around the WoodsSigh at her Song, and with her Wail resound.AND now the feather'd Youth their former BoundsArdent disdain, and weighing oft their Wings,Demand the free Possssion of the Sky.But this glad Office more, and then dissolvesParental Love at once; for needless grown,Unlavish Wisdom never works in vain.'Tis on some Evening, sunny, grateful, mild,When nought but Balm is breathing thro' the Woods,With yellow Lustre bright, that the new TribesVisit the spacious Heavens, and look abroadOn Nature's Common, far as they can see,Or wing, their Range, and Pasture. O'er the BoughsDancing about, still at the giddy VergeTheir Resolution fails; their Pinions still,In loose Libration stretch'd, the void AbruptTrembling refuse: till down before them flyThe Parent-Guides, and chide, exhort, command,Or push them off. The surging Air receivesThe plumy Burden; and their self-taught WingsWinnow the waving Element. On Ground
Alighted bolder, up again they leadFarther and farther on the lengthning Flight;Till vanish'd every Fear, and every PowerRouz'd into Life, and Action, in the VoidTh' exoner'd Parents see their soaring Race,And once rejoicing, never know them more.HIGH from the Summit of a craggy Cliff,Hung o'er the green Sea grudging at it's Base,The Royal Eagle draws his Young, resolv'dTo try them at the Sun. Strong-pounc'd, and brightAs burnish'd Day, they up the blue Sky wind,Leaving dull Sight below, and with fixt GazeDrink in their native Noon: The Father-KingClaps his glad Pinions, and approves the Birth.AND should I wander to the Rural Seat,Whose aged Oaks, and venerable GloomInvite the noisy Rook, with Pleasure there,I might the various Polity survey
Of the mixt Houshold Kind. The careful HenCalls all her chirping Family around,Fed, and defended by the fearless Cock,Whose Breast with Ardour flames, as on he walksGraceful, and crows Defiance. In the Pond,The finely-checker'd Duck, before her Train,Rows garrulous. The stately-sailing SwanGives out his snowy Plumage to the Gale,And, arching proud his Neck, with oary FeetBears onward fierce, and beats you from the Bank,Protective of his Young. The Turkey nigh,Loud-threatning, reddens; while the Peacock spreadsHis every-colour'd Glory to the Sun,And swims in floating Majesty along.O'er the whole homely Scene, the cooing DoveFlies thick in amorous Chace, and wanton rollsThe glancing Eye, and turns the changeful Neck.WHILE thus the gentle Tenants of the ShadeIndulge their purer Loves, the rougher World
Of Brutes below rush furious into Flame,And fierce Desire. Thro' all his lusty VeinsThe Bull, deep-scorcht, receives the raging Fire.Of Pasture sick, and negligent of Food,Scarce-seen, he wades among the yellow Broom,While o'er his brawny Back the rambling SpraysLuxuriant shoot; or thro' the mazy WoodDejected wanders, nor th' inticing BudCrops, tho' it presses on his careless Sense:For, wrapt in mad Imagination, heRoars for the Fight, and idly butting feignsA Rival gor'd in every knotty Trunk.Such should he meet, the bellowing War begins;Their Eyes flash Fury; to the hollow'd Earth,Whence the Sand flies, they mutter bloody Deeds,And groaning vast th' impetuous Battel mix:While the fair Heifer, redolent, in ViewStands kindling up their Rage. The trembling Steed,With this hot Impulse seiz'd in every Nerve,Nor hears the Rein, nor heeds the sounding Whip;
Blows are not felt; but tossing high his Head,And by the well-known Joy to distant PlainsAttracted strong, all wild, he bursts away;O'er Rocks, and Woods, and craggy Mountains flies,And neighing on th' aerial Summit takesTh' informing Gale; then steep-descending stemsThe headlong Torrents foaming down the Hills,Even where the Madness of the straiten'd StreamTurns in black Eddies round: Such is the ForceWith which his frantic Heart, and Sinews swell.NOR, undelighted by the boundless Spring,Are the broad Monsters of the Deep: thro' allTheir oozy Caves, and gelid Kingdoms rous'd,They flounce, and tumble in unwieldy Joy.Dire were the Strain, and dissonant, to singThe cruel Raptures of the Savage Kind;How the red Lioness, her Whelps forgotAmid the thoughtless Fury of her Heart,The lank rapacious Wolf, th' unshapely Bear,
The spotted Tyger, fellest of the Fell,And all the Terrors of the Lybian Swain,By this new Flame their Native Wrath sublim'd,Roam the resounding Waste in fiercer Bands,And growl their horrid Loves. But this the ThemeI sing, transported to the British Fair,Forbids, and leads me to the Mountain-brow,Where sits the Shepherd on the grassy Turf,Inhaling, healthful, the descending Sun.Around Him feeds his many-bleating Flock,Of various Cadence; and his sportive Lambs,This way and that convolv'd in friskful Glee,Their little Frolicks play. And now the RaceInvites them forth; when swift, the Signal given,They start away, and sweep the circly MoundThat runs around the Hill; the Rampart onceOf Iron War, in antient barbarous Times,When disunited Britain ever bled,Lost in eternal Broil; ere yet she grewTo this deep-laid, indissoluble State,
Where Wealth and Commerce lift their golden Head,And o'er our Labours Liberty and LawIllustrious watch, the Wonder of a World!WHAT is this mighty Breath, ye Curious, say,Which, in a Language rather felt than heard,Instructs the Fowls of Heaven; and thro' their BreastsThese Arts of Love diffuses?—What? but GOD!Inspiring GOD! who boundless Spirit all,And unremitting Energy, pervades,Subsists, adjusts, and agitates the Whole.He ceaseless works alone, and yet aloneSeems not to work, so exquisitely fram'dIs this complex, amazing Scene of Things.But tho' conceal'd, to every purer EyeTh' informing Author in his Works appears;His Grandeur in the Heavens: the Sun, and Moon,Whether that fires the Day, or falling thisPours out a lucid Softness o'er the Night,Are but a Beam from Him. The glittering Stars,
By the deep Ear of Meditation heard,Still in their Midnight Watches sing of Him.He nods a Calm. The Tempest blows His Wrath,Roots up the Forest, and o'erturns the Main.The Thunder is His Voice; and the red FlashHis speedy Sword of Justice. At His TouchThe Mountains flame. He takes the solid Earth,And rocks the Nations. Nor in these alone,In every common Instance GOD is seen;And to the Man, who casts his mental EyeAbroad, unnotic'd Wonders rise. But chiefIn Thee, Boon Spring, and in thy softer Scenes,The Smiling GOD appears; while Water, Earth,And Air attest his Bounty, which instilsInto the Brutes this temporary Thought,And annual melts their undesigning HeartsProfusely thus in Tenderness, and Joy.STILL let my Song a nobler. Note assume,And sing th' infusive Force of Spring on Man;
When Heaven and Earth, as if contending, vieTo raise his Being, and serene his Soul.Can he forbear to smile with Nature? CanThe stormy Passions in his Bosom rowl,While every Gale is Peace, and every GroveIs Melody? Hence, from the bounteous WalksOf flowing Spring, ye fordid Sons of Earth,Hard, and unfeeling of Another's Woe,Or only lavish to Yourselves,—away.But come, ye generous Breasts, in whose wide Thought,Of all his Works, Creative Bounty, most,Divinely burns; and on your open Front,And liberal Eye, sits, from his dark RetreatInviting modest Want. Nor only fair,And easy of Approach; your active SearchLeaves no cold wintry Corner unexplor'd,Like silent-working Heaven, surprizing oftThe lonely Heart with unexpected Good.For you the roving Spirit of the WindBlows Spring abroad, for you the teeming Clouds
Descend in buxom Plenty o'er the World,And the Sun spreads his genial Blaze for you,Ye flower of Human Race! In these green Days,Sad-pining Sickness lifts her languid Head;Life flows afresh; and young-ey'd Health exaltsThe whole Creation round. Contentment walksThe Sunny Glade, and feels an inward BlissSpring o'er his Mind, beyond the Pride of KingsE'er to bestow. Serenity apaceInduces Thought, and Contemplation still.By small Degrees the Love of Nature works,And warms the Bosom; till at last arriv'dTo Rapture, and enthusiastic Heat,We feel the present Deity, and tasteThe Joy of GOD, to see a happy World.'Tis Harmony, that World-embracing Power,By which all Beings are adjusted, eachTo all around, impelling and impell'dIn endless Circulation, that inspires
This universal Smile. Thus the glad Skies,The wide-rejoycing Earth, the Woods, the Streams,With every Life they hold, down to the FlowerThat paints the lowly Vale, or Insect-WingWav'd o'er the Shepherd's Slumber, touch the MindTo Nature tun'd, with a light-flying Hand,Invisible, quick-urging, thro' the Nerves,The glittering Spirits, in a Flood of Day.HENCE from the Virgin's Cheek, a fresher BloomShoots, less and less, the live Carnation round;Her Lips blush deeper Sweets; she breathes of Youth;The shining Moisture swells into her Eyes,In brighter Flow; her wishing Bosom heavesWith Palpitations wild; kind Tumults seizeHer Veins, and all her yielding Soul is Love.From the keen Gaze her Lover turns away,Full of the dear ecstatic Power, and sickWith sighing Languishment. Ah then, ye Fair!Be greatly cautious of your sliding Hearts;
Dare not th' infectious Sigh, the pleading EyeIn meek Submission drest, deject, and low,But full of tempting Guile. Let not the Tongue,Prompt to deceive, with Adulation smooth,Gain on your purpos'd Wills. Nor in the Bower,Where Woodbines flaunt, and Roses shed a Couch,While Evening draws her crimson'd Curtains round,Trust your soft Minutes with betraying Man.AND let th' aspiring Youth beware of Love,And shun th' enchanting Glance, for 'tis too lateWhen on his Heart the Torrent Softness pours.Then Interest sinks to Dirt, and distant FameDissolves in Air away. While the fond SoulIs wrapt in Dreams of Ecstacy, and Bliss;Still paints th' illusive Form, the kindling Grace,Th' alluring Smile, the full aethereal EyeEffusing Heaven; and listens ardent stillTo the small Voice, where Harmony and Wit,A modest, melting, mingled Sweetness, flow.
No sooner is the fair Idea form'd,And Contemplation fixes on the Theme,Than from his own Creation wild He flies,Sick of a Shadow. Absence comes apace,And shoots his every Pang into his Breast.'Tis nought but Gloom around. The darken'd SunLoses his Light. The rosy-bosom'd SpringTo weeping Fancy pines; and yon bright ArchOf Heaven low-bends into a dusky Vault.All Nature fades extinct; and She aloneHeard, felt, and seen, possesses every Thought,Fills every Sense, and pants in every Vein.Books are but formal Dulness, tedious Friends,And sad amid the Social Band he sits,Lonely, and inattentive. From the TongueTh' unfinish'd Period falls: white, born awayOn swelling Thought, his wafted Spirit fliesTo the dear Bosom of his absent Fair;And leaves the Semblance of a Lover, fix'dIn melancholy Site, with Head declin'd,
And Love-dejected Eyes. Sudden he starts,Shook from his tender Trance, and restless runsTo glimmering Shades, and sympathetic Glooms,Where the dun Umbrage o'er the falling StreamRomantic hangs; there thro' the pensive DuskStrays, in Heart-thrilling Meditation lost,Indulging all to Love: or on the BankThrown, amid drooping Lillies, swells the BreezeWith Sighs unceasing, and the Brook with Tears.Thus in soft Anguish he consumes the Day;Nor quits his deep Retirement, till the MoonPeeps thro' the Chambers of the fleecy East,Enlighten'd by Degrees, and in her TrainLeads on the gentle Hours; then forth He walks,Beneath the trembling Languish of her Beams,With soften'd Soul, and wooes the Bird of EveTo mingle Woes with his: or while the World,And all the Sons of Care lie hush'd in Sleep,Associates with the Mid-night Shadows drear,And, sighing to the lonely Taper, pours
His sweetly-tortur'd Heart into the PageMeant for the moving Messenger of Love.But ah how faint, how meaningless, and poorTo what his Passion swells! which bursts the BoundsOf every Eloquence, and asks for Looks,Where Fondness flows on Fondness, Love on Love;Entwisting Beams with Her's, and speaking moreThan ever charm'd, ecstatic Poet sigh'dTo listening Beauty, bright with conscious Smiles,And graceful Vanity. But if on BedDelirious flung, Sleep from his Pillow flies.All Night he tosses, nor the balmy PowerIn any Posture finds; 'till the grey MornLifts her pale Lustre on the paler Wretch,Exanimate by Love: and then perhapsExhausted Nature sinks a-while to Rest,Still interrupted by disorder'd Dreams,That o'er the sick Imagination rise,And in black Colours paint the mimic Scene.Oft with the Charmer of his Soul he talks;
Sometimes in Growds distrest; or if retir'dTo secret-winding,, Flower-inwoven Bowers,Far from the dull Impertinence of Man,Just as He kneeling all his former CaresBegins to lose in vast oblivious Love,Snatch'd from her yielded Hand, he knows not how,Thro' Forests huge, and long untravel'd HeathsWith Desolation brown, he wanders waste,In Night and Tempest wrapt; or shrinks aghast,Back, from the bending Precipice; or wadesThe turbid Stream below, and strives to reachThe farther Shore, where succourless, and sad,His Dearer Life extends her beckoning Arms,But strives in vain, born by th' outragious FloodTo Distance down, he rides the ridgy Wave,Or whelm'd beneath the boiling Eddy sinks.Then a weak, wailing, lamentable CryIs heard, and all in Tears he wakes, againTo tread the Circle of revolving Woe.These are the charming Agonies of Love,
Whose Misery delights. But thro' the HeartShould Jealousy it's Venom once diffuse,'Tis then delightful Misery no more,But Agony unmixt, incessant Rage,Corroding every Thought, and blasting allThe Paradise of Love. Ye Fairy Prospects then,Ye Beds of Roses, and ye Bowers of Joy,Farewell! Ye Gleamings of departing Peace,Shine out your last! The yellow-tinging PlagueInternal Vision taints, and in a NightOf livid Gloom Imagination wraps.Ay then, instead of Love-enliven'd Cheeks,Of Sunny Features, and of ardent EyesWith flowing Rapture bright, dark Looks succeed,Suffus'd, and glaring with untender Fire,A clouded Aspect, and a burning Cheek,Where the whole poison'd Soul, malignant, fits,And frightens Love away. Ten thousand Fears,Invented wild, ten thousand frantic ViewsOf horrid Rivals, hanging on the Charms
For which he melts in Fondness, eat him upWith fervent Anguish, and consuming Pine.In vain Reproaches lend their idle Aid,Deceitful Pride, and Resolution frail,Giving a Moment's Ease. Reflection pours,Afresh, her Beauties on his busy Thought,Her first Endearments, twining round the Soul,With all the Witchcraft of ensnaring Love.Strait the fierce Storm involves his Mind anew,Flames thro' the Nerves, and boils along the Veins;While anxious Doubt distracts the tortur'd Heart;For even the sad Assurance of his FearsWere Heaven to what he feels. Thus the warm Youth,Whom Love deludes into his thorny Wilds,Thro' flowery-tempting Paths, or leads a LifeOf feavor'd Rapture, or of cruel Care;His brightest Aims extinguish'd all, and allHis lively Moments running down to Waste.BUT happy They! the Happiest of their Kind!Whom gentler Stars unite, and in one FateTheir Hearts, their Fortunes, and their Beings blend.'Tis not the courser Tie of human Laws,Unnatural oft, and foreign to the Mind,Which binds their Peace, but Harmony itself,Attuning all their Passions into Love;Where Friendship full-exerts his softest Power,Perfect Esteem enliven'd by DesireIneffable, and Sympathy of Soul,Thought meeting Thought, and Will preventing Will,With boundless Confidence; for nought but LoveCan answer Love, and render Bliss secure.Let Him, ungenerous, who, alone intentTo bless himself, from sordid Parents buysThe loathing Virgin, in eternal Care,Well-merited, consume his Nights and Days.Let barbarous Nations, whose inhuman LoveIs wild Desire fierce as the Suns they feel,Let Eastern Tyrants from the Light of Heaven
Seclude their Bosom-slaves, meanly possestOf a meer, lifeless, violated Form:While those whom Love cements, in holy Faith,And equal Transport, free as Nature, live,Disdaining Fear; for what's the World to them,It's Pomp, it's Pleasure, and it's Nonsense all!Who in each other clasp whatever fairHigh Fancy forms, and lavish Hearts can wish,Something than Beauty dearer, should they lookOr on the Mind, or Mind-illumin'd Face,Truth, Goodness, Honour, Harmony and Love,The richest Bounty of indulgent Heaven.Mean-time a smiling Offspring rises round,And mingles both their Graces. By degrees,The human Blossom blows; and every Day,Soft as it rolls along, shows some new Charm,The Father's Lustre, and the Mother's Bloom.Then infant Reason grows apace, and callsFor the kind Hand of an assiduous Care:Delightful Task! to rear the tender Thought,
To teach the young Idea how to shoot,To pour the fresh Instruction o'er the Mind,To breathe th' inspiring Spirit, and to plantThe generous Purpose in the glowing Breast.Oh speak the Joy! You, whom the sudden TearSurprizes often, while you look around,And nothing strikes your Eye but Sights of Bliss,All various Nature pressing on the Heart,Obedient Fortune, and approving Heaven.These are the Blessings of diviner Love;And thus their Moments fly; the Seasons thus,As ceaseless round a jarring World they roll,Still find Them happy; and consenting SPRINGSheds her own rosy Garland on their Head:Till Evening comes at last, cool, gentle, calm;When after the long vernal Day of Life,Enamour'd more, as Soul approaches Soul,Together, down They sink in social Sleep.THE END.ERRATA.PAGE 13, line 12, for retracted read refracted; p. 18,
