I sinkUnder the horror of his devotees.AMELIA.The time will come, my Laura, when you'll knowThe wretches, who commit such dreadful crimes,Are not of the religion you accuse.LAURA.Were they not Christians that on Niger's flood,On board their dreadful bark, receiv'd the lostJaqueena? (for the name of Laura bearsThe badge of slavery, and my reproach.)Are they, not Christians, who, in all this land,Make the poor Africans perform the taskOf beasts; not barely to sustain the toil,But to endure the torture; and with stripes,With nakedness and hunger, to lie down,Stall'd worse than beasts, to rankle in their sores?AMELIA.This is too much, sweet Laura; thus with tears,See me lament my country's hapless crimes;And the vile prejudice which clogs the wheelOf partial justice.—LAURA.—Can a slave then hopeFor your humanity?—for tho' the bloodIs of one dye, without congenial sunsIt ripens not, nor meliorates to love.Yet will I not forget your bounteous gifts,For Africans know not ingratitude!I am a slave, not knowing bondage here,But in detention from my native land;For my kind mistress, as Amelia kind,Nor gives me chains nor stripes, nor wears a frown.There are some Christians of a milder soul,And such poor Laura happily protect;For if Amelia calls me by that name,Its terrors cease, tho' it still comprehendsThe tenor of my fortune.—AMELIA.—Whilst your mindSeems thus imprest with favourable thoughts,And you confess Amelia's not severe,Trust to my ear the story of your life,And make me more your friend by sorrowing more,By mingling mutual griefs with Laura's tears.LAURA.A soothing melancholy still succeedsThe repetition of each solemn tale,Misfortune has to tell.—In silence, griefPreys most upon the soul; from sympathy,From soft compassion of our sorrowings,A sweet alleviation gently breathes.Not of inferior race, my father rul'dA province of the realm of Benin.—Oft approbation shone upon his eye,Oft fond affection fill'd my mother's looks,Whilst on their smiling progeny they gaz'd,And call'd, and kiss'd their daughter, now your slave.AMELIA.Predicting, in the fondness of their hopes,Propitious fortunes to their darling child.LAURA.Nor were their hopes mere shadows of the mind;For with affection's tenderest concernMy steps were follow'd, and my looks pursu'd;They rul'd another's fate:—with breasts of ice,As barren as the snows they emulate,You fair ones call such truths mere vanity;The great Manzaro kneel'd to win my heart:What wretchedness is mine!—I lov'd the Prince,Whom only death can to my love restore:On his tremendous wing he'll bear me hence,And to Zanfara waft this spirit safe,Superior to the frauds of cruel men.AMELIA.Some better Iot, sweet Laura, may betide.LAURA.Hope has departed hence, and left my soulTo follow after, when all earthly griefsAre dissipated by the hand of death.It soothes the sorrows of my wretched mind,To grave the rock with piteous characters,(Points to the rock.)That move the fountain's never-ceasing tears,To weep for ever o'er Manzara's name;Whilst gentle spirits in the sighing winds,On the sad sculptures mourn, that memorizeMy mother and my brothers.—AMELIA—What of them?LAURA.Within the forest's skirts our tents were pitch'd,For more commodious hunting; far advanc'dThe men were on the chase; when we, who heldThe little camp, were taken prisoners:A horrid tribe of robbers, then in leagueWith Europeans, trading to our states,Had stolen upon our unsuspicious guards.AMELIA.Of what complexion, of what country born,Were those base violators of the land?LAURA.The cruel leaders were of British birth,The rest of Africa; but long possess'dBy the fell demons of Europa's shores,They, to recruit the heart for wickedness,Imbibe infernal furies in their drink,From deepest hell by chymic magic rais'd,That drive the brain to madness, and impelThe hand to deeds of darkness.—AMELIA.—What ensued?LAURA.Our men were bound in fetters, neck to neck,And hand to hand, and we their woeful stepsMust needs pursue:—when, frantic with her grief,My mother seiz'd a javelin for revenge,And by her angry arm one chieftain fell:But anger and resistance were in vain!She dy'd beneath a thousand dreadful wounds;Whilst to her bleeding bosom, grasping close,In agonies of death, her youngest son,A cruel lance transfix'd both breasts at once;And as the boy hung writhing on the shaft,The wretches made diversion of his pangs.AMELIA.O Britain! where's thy boasted excellence?Thy fame, that sounds on every peopled shore?Thy vaunted jurisprudence, and thy loveOf liberty?—LAURA.—I then conceiv'd no thoughtOf what might follow, what should be our fate;But in immediate sorrows my sad mindWas all absorb'd.—We were receiv'd on boardA vessel, crowded with a wretched race:Description finds no language to expressThe horrors of the voyage.—The hand of fateReleas'd a multitude!—within these armsMy other brother dy'd; and I'm forlorn!AMELIA.My soul is full of grief; and yet a rayOf hope divine, like some prophetic light,By influence of guardian angel given,Takes hold upon my mind. —But we're observ'd;You must avoid the person that draws near;Retire, and spare your grief; the tale he bringsWould much increase your tears.—
Ex. Laura.AMELIAalone.—I feel my heartRenounce Antonio!—his hateful tradeImbitters every thought of intercourse.Habituated to subdue the forceOf his humanity, what can remainWithin the breast of man that offers fruitsFor nuptial happiness?—ANTONIOenters.—To meet you thus,Is most propitious to my anxious hopes:My voyage perform'd, with many healthy slavesI now return, to claim your faithful vows;And if the market proves of advanc'd price,My fortune's made, and you alone commandMy future life—AMELIA.—I know not what it means,Some secret intimation moves my mind,That no felicity can e'er attendRiches obtain'd by such inhuman ways.ANTONIO.Are these untoward sentiments conceiv'dFrom Laura's guileful tears and whining tales?Can my Amelia estrange her mindFrom reason, and her proper judgment yieldTo errors, which prevail alone through fraud?AMELIA.There's more than fraud, more than invention fillsThe story of that hapless virgin's fate.ANTONIO.What inhumanity disturbs your thoughts?The navigator is not culpable;He takes the common traffic of the land,And by his toil brings riches to the state;The police of the nations there is such,Like other animals, the herdsman sellsThe Negro drove.—AMELIA.—I tremble at the thought!They that promote the sin, partake the crime.ANTONIO.Inferior in creation, tho' in formOf human kind;—each race of animalsKnows its gradations;—and from perfect man,The Negro tribe is intermediate;It links the series, that straight descendInto the monkey line.—AMELIA.—If you would saveMy mind from detestation, treat not thusA subject, over which my labouring soulEndures acutest pangs; if you would winMy better sentiments, this traffic leave;The generous association join,Who labour in humanity's great cause,With holy zeal, to gain abolishmentOf your infernal merchandize.—ANTONIO.My heart,Already your's, your dictates must pursue.AMELIA.'Tis well, Antonio, and my confidenceRenews: my Laura's sorrows fill my mind;I must procure the maid her liberty.ANTONIO.And when obtain'd, what prospect will ensue?Where are the means of giving happiness?You'll only send her forth to meagre want,And in a foreign land, a vagabond,Expose her to a thousand miseries.AMELIA.She must return to Africa again,Her country, and her friends.—ANTONIO.—Romantic thought!The wand'ring tribe she left, perhaps dispers'd,The government dissolv'd, new tyrants reign;And warfare, the rough habit of their lives,With chequer'd fortunes marks each petty Prince,Now reigning, now in chains,—on Afric's coast,To greater perils, greater woes expos'd;There's not a slave that in this province toils,But, if return'd, would worship the dire nameOf slavery, that makes them tremble now.AMELIA.Your arguments enlarge the dreadful boundsOf that vast sin which on your traffic rests;If restitution is impossible,The base captivity, (that thus cuts offAll human hope, and no kind limit yieldsTo the sad injury, but in the tomb,)Of all the crimes on earth, becomes the worst:My weary mind now finds no resting-place,ANTONIO.Even the servitude in which they sigh,Affords superior happiness and easeTo what their birthright gave—AMELIA.—Desist, desist,I'll hear no more.—'Tis in the human mindThe various estimates of happinessAre rang'd, whilst free and voluntary willDirects the choice.—It is not luxury,With all its artificial wants and woes,That points out the criterion to mankind:It is not circumstance, prescrib'd and boundWithin the limits of necessity,(For that's a term mere fashion has assum'd)That points where Happiness shall stay her foot:'Tis habit that prepares the mind for ease;And knowing no restraint, contentment givesThe various types that various nations hold,Whence to characterise the heavenly gift,Each calls felicity.—The human soulFinds liberty so innate, through the worldThe love of it prevails.—See, Pembroke comes,Humanity's fast friend.—ANTONIO—Hypocrisy'sOwn son.—PEMBROKEenters.—Disgrace pursues disgrace!America stands blighted in her fame!How are the annals of her glory stain'd!AMELIA.What new occasion wounds your gracious mind?PEMBROKE.Still here we hold the mart of human kind,New cargoes crowd our shores, and on the beachThe squalid multitudes are pouring forth,From over-loaded ships, which, like the curseOf vile Pandora's box, bring forth disease,With misery, and pallid want,Crippled and maim'd, whose ulcerating soresCling to the canker'd chains, that rankle deep,And seek the bone.—ANTONIO.—Exists there not a lawWhich should restrain such mischief-working tongues,As hurt the merchant's credit and his wares?Thy phrase is false; the slaves are healthy, young,And vigorous.—PEMBROKE.—Then be it so.—The world,With anxious eye, regarded ev'ry stepThat led the revolution to effect,And made us independent.—Wond'ring statesBeheld our strength:—Our public virtue shoneWith a meridian lustre, that amaz'dThe nations who submit to monarchy,And heaven stood influenc'd, propitious stood,And look'd approving on the energyThat in the sacred cause of liberty,In ev'ry prayer we breath'd, in every stepMaintain'd, that brought fruition to our hopes.AMELIA.How has our country forfeited its fame?PEMBROKE.In Britain, which we did calumniateWith charge of tyranny and power usurp'd,The flame, humanity's most holy flame,Breaks forth illustrious; all the people burnWith sense of liberty: they boasted not!And the poor African the object growsOf their wise councils, and their sov'reign's care:Whilst we, who mocked God with impious prayer,Mock'd the surrounding world with fallacy,Assum'd a character we could not prove;Now sever'd—now alien'd—and left alone,Pull off the mask, and vote an impious law,Restraining liberty for twenty years.AMELIA.—Astonishing!—ANTONIO.—Firm sinews to bestowTo trade,—the strength of nations.—PEMBROKE.—Public faithAlone supports a people's strength.—In fraudAnd treachery few momentary smilesOf fortune fall; but probity affordsStability and honour to a state.What's the idea to the labouring wretch,That twenty toilsome years may terminateHis grievous task?—a space of sullen time,That much exceeds their ordinary stageOf life.—ANTONIO.—The legislature wisely sawInevitable ruin must succeed,If instantly we should emancipateAnd trust to hirelings.—Such excessive changeIn dire confusion would involve the land;What mode of government could e'er restrainThe slaves discharg'd and set at liberty?That mighty work must by progression move,And into habit grow by slow degrees;Experience of clemency and laws,That mutual safety yield, must tameThe savage's ferocious habit first,And fit him for subordinance.—PEMBROKE.—This dayThe council sits:—On their opinion hangsThe fate of thousands:—If yet adverse TimeHis wither'd hand extends against the stepsOf liberty, a stigma he implants,Which all his smiles, for ages, won't erase:The issue I expect impatiently.
Exit.ANTONIO.Are you deceiv'd, Amelia, by such phrase?Whilst honesty, with open countenance,Is rash perhaps, and speaks too much of truth,Despising subtlety:—For that man's godIs avarice:—He'd suit the Japanese,And on the Christian's ensign trade and traffic.AMELIA.Your mind is heated, and resentment promptsThe character you draw —ANTONIO.—We soon may proveHis public virtue, when his interestIs fairly recogniz'd:—for me, I ownThe trade has much of bitterness and woe:Command me in your Laura's interest;But first provide her some establishment,To bless and crown with liberty.End of the FIRST ACT.ACT II. Scene, a Plantation and Slaves at Work.The stage being extended, sunry persons are seen performing the various labours of slaves; the back scene continuing the representation.CALABAN and HORATIO.CALABAN.THIS was a glorious voyage!—The sturdy knavesAre fit for any labour, and we bringFull fifteen hundred safely to the port.HORATIO.What province are they of?—For much dependsUpon the breed; some of the upland slaves,That border on the desert, are of mindSo dark and so indocile, that they seemOf one gradation only above brutes;Those of more eastern clime are indolent,(As bears are sluggish, and not mov'd by stripes,)They'll neither serve the mill nor till the ground.CALABAN.Well, master, mine are of the fav'rite breed;Twice ten degrees remov'd from the baboon;Their form is human, and they're almost men:Boney and strong, of countenance acute,And as hyaenas savage:—they're the slavesFor labour; as the mind is fierce and quick,Their bodies in proportion active are;On mountains skirts and wilds of Zara bred,The topsmen drove the herd to Niger's banks,The mart of Africa.—HORATIO.—Five hundred malesI purchase at your price; but in the lotI'll not receive that brute, that stands aloof,And looks as if he held high estimateOf his own consequence; a slave like himWould soon create a mutiny, and stirMy whole plantation into plots and vileConspiracies.—CALABAN.—The creature's only mad,Through separation from his concubines:So the fierce bull would bellow and rebound,When from the pasture driven that holds his kine:Keep him but low in food, and hard at work,And all those fiery sparks his nature holds,Will in free perspiration dissipate.Enter MARTINO and PEMBROKE.PEMBROKE.Dost thou, Martino, purchase any slaves?Here is the carcase-man.—CALABAN.—And thou the knaveThat would destroy thy country by thy wiles;For if the council, mov'd by such men's cries,Should pass the curs'd emancipation vote,The envious Britons, who could not subdue,Will triumph in the ruin, treacheryCan soon effect, by wretches such as thee.PEMBROKE to MARTINO.Some caution should be held, for much dependsUpon the cause now agitating.—MARTINO.And not a little on the market too.CALABAN.You purchase not, and therefore shall not prate,To hinder the fair trader in his sale.PEMBROKE.Russian, retire, and know thy province here;Send forth thy factor, for to him belongsThis duty; and for thee, associateWith fellows of thy proper element,Or to the magistrates I'll make complaint.CALABAN.Thy phrase is mighty, tho' thy figure's meek.ANTONIO enters.MARTINO.The factor comes, and after him a few,By way of sample, of the fittest slaves.ANTONIO.Not so; these only bring some stores on shore,The rest, refreshing on the beach, will waitTo morrow's noon, when they will be expos'd.Several slaves enter staggering under excessive burthens, weak and emaciated with their voyage: after them, one who refuses any labour. As he enters and looks upon the scene where the slaves are at work, he starts.MOOR.Ah! horrid spectacle of miseryAnd foul disgrace!—Are these thy wretched sons,Long suffering Afric?—These of thy raceOf mighty men, whose hardy sinews drawThe sounding bow, and launch the javelinWith mortal strength?—Who, destitute of fear,Contend with hungry lions for their prey,And grapple with the tiger in his rage?Are ye so tame!—ANTONIO.—Consider what's your lot,And merit clemency.—MOOR.—Canst thou persuadeThe raging winds to soften to thy will,And whistle in thine ear?—Or dost thou knowHow to appease the deep Atlantic's voice,When tempests howl on Gambia's aestuary?If thou hast magic in thee to do these,Then thou may'st smooth the temper of my soul.CALABAN.Bravo, my gallant blade, spoke like thyself!MOOR.Was this the land where that celestialdrug,That cures a thousand evils of the mind,Was planted by the seraphs of the sun,And by fair daughters of the silent moonWater'd with dew of heaven, here I might findThe godlike gift of liberty; perhapsIn its vicinity doth justice grow;Of these I'd mix a potion should disgorgeThe monsters of the deep.—ANTONIO.—To merit suchYou must be peaceable, and to the stateObedient.—MOOR.—Away—revile me not;—Compassionate my fortune, not contemnMy impotence!—behold these shameful chains;Are they not peaceable! are not these handsSubmissive?—and this neck obedient?This is not worthy thy more feeling heart!Yet to my strength what would these bonds avail,If an exertion could improve my lot?PEMBROKE.Thy moderation merits our esteem;If ought of justice thou hast here to claim,Our governor and council daily sitWithin the public hall, dispensing thereImpartially.—MOOR.—I mark thee wond'rous well;And if the spirits of my ancestorsHave not forsaken me, or lost their courseO'er the wide desert of the dreary main,Perhaps the deity which we adoreWill not forget me in a foreign land;For they, retaining much of amity,Will whisper in his ear,—"The African's"In chains."CALABAN.He raves, and, with his fortune mad,He knows not what he says.—MOOR.—Too true, alas!Mad with my injuries, and scoff'd at too:As stubble to the lightning, I could shakeThese links to atoms, that my vengeful eyesMight see thy heart's blood spout; but that my viewsAre larger, and this friend to human kindHas breath'd into my soul a nobler hope,And made me dream of justice.—CALABAN.—And thy dreamWill, like the vision of the rolling cloud,Dissolve, and only mock thy sickly brain:Return,—and at the lodge where thou art stall'dWait for to-morrow's market.—PEMBROKE.—If he cravesA hearing for redress of injury,I will protect the man, and pledge his price.CALABAN.Dost thou encourage mutiny?—PEMBROKE.—No moreThan I do villains.—ANTONIO.—This poor slave behav'dWith much discretion in the tedious voyage,And seem'd above his fortune, save when sighsWould sometimes heave his breast, or tears would fall.MOOR.Antonio was compassionate:—Were IIn Africa, I would not blush to sayWhat my heart feels.—CALABAN.—Dost thou depart with me.Or in this new-form'd friendship shelter seek?MOOR.I crave to stand before the governor,And claim the benefit of those good lawsThat even comprehend a Negro's wrongs.CALABAN.There is no law that can discharge a slave:Here slaves are property.—PEMBROKE.—Can you informWhether by purchase he obtain'd this man?ANTONIO.Not being of my lot, I'm ignorant.MOOR.Such the peculiar hardship of my fate!But if my property may be restor'd,Intelligence will follow.—CALABAN.—He appeals,And I reserve my evidence to checkHis subtleties.—He's been some pagan priest,Or one in magic ministering to hell,And thence derives his sophistry and spells.
Exit Cal.PEMBROKE.Before the council, what of evidenceCanst thou produce?—MOOR.—The evidence of right,Which is the most acceptable to heaven.PEMBROKE.What witnesses?—MOOR.—E'en none.—PEMBROKE.—How then prevail?MOOR.By argument, and influence of truth.ANTONIO.What are the objects that the slave pursues?MOOR.Many and various are my mind's desires,As my dire injuries are multiply'd.First, I would move the council to restoreThose things which were about my person borneWhen I was made a captive.—ANTONIO.—Now retain'dBy Calaban?—MOOR.—Important in my cause.ANTONIO.But you had arms.—MOOR.—Should they be deny'd,Yet brought before the council, those true marksWhich still contain my evidence they'll bear,And not an African, from Niger's sourceTo Gambia's gulph, but knows their signatures.ANTONIO.If that be all you seek, command my voice.MOOR.Oh that Antonio was an African!The measure's now resov'd, pursue the way,Impatience raises tumults in my breast.As they pass through the scene, the MOOR stands to gaze on the sculptures upon the rock.When first I trod this shore, I thought my stepsWere planted in the regions of the fiends,Those evil genii that haunt the waysOf Afric's wretched sons with sad mishap:But—ah!—astonishment!ANTONIO.— What is't you read?MOOR.Pierc'd on this rock are characters obscure,In divination cast; an horoscope,In which I find myself involv'd.—Who cutThe mystic line, and carv'd the prophecy,Remains untold.—PEMBROKE.—The hieroglyphics these?
(Pointing to the rock.)ANTONIO.Decypher them.—MOOR.—'Tis more than I may do;The same angelic hand that here engrav'dThe sacred emblems hovers in the cloudsAnd leaves me not.
(kneels.)
"O thou mysterious light!"Essence divine! incomprehensible!"Who out of darkness brings forth mighty deeds,"And didst of nothing form all Africa!"Still imperceptible, but in thy works,"Let thy blest spirit lift thy servant up"From this adversity."
(rises.)
My soul's refresh'd.PEMBROKE.Thy zeal has touch'd my spirit.—ANTONIO.—Oh! my God,What is't we do! what right can we assumeTo bring into vile bondage, men like this,Who serve thee, tho' in darkness!—
(aside.)PEMBROKE.Describe what moves thee thus.—MOOR.—I know the handThat grav'd that character must be divine;The fountain nymph invoking to her tearsIt gives a name, a fav'rite female name,Dear to my memory; so totallyUnknown beyond the vast Atlantic's bounds,Which fevers this your nether world from ours,That nothing but some holy angel's armCould reach the mighty distance; one whose graspEmbraces all the earth.—ANTONIO.—'Tis wonderful!MOOR.The rest is more obscure: petitioningFor pity from the spirits of the air,Groans are expir'd, for some catastropheIn which a mother with her infants fell:My soul sustains such dreadful agony,Such secret sorrows wrestle at my heart,I cannot utter more.—To kneel—to weep—To worship—to expire—is all that's leftThe wretched African.—PEMBROKE.Thou wound'st our heartsWith sorrow!—ANTONIO.—Anguish not to be endur'd!Why was I privy to such impious deeds?
(aside.)MOOR.I am unman'd!—I lose my pious hope,My holy confidence! yet he is not alone,Not desolate, forsaken, that has friendsIn heaven!—Why do I linger then behind!Bereft of all that life could give! —Oh Africa!What is there left thus to suspend my soul!ANTONIO.Why do we not proceed?MOOR.—Grief's tempest ravesWithin my heart, and sorrows are renew'd;My adverse fortune did not promise this,That in the land of bondage I should meetWith traces, mournful traces, of the sourceOf ev'ry tear I shed, and all my woes!But hold—I'd read again.—A thought succeedsThat blazes with delight!—Perhaps the handInscribing this, was her's!—Oh mighty powers!And who but she could tell the dreadful tale,Divine my fortune, and divulge her own?Do you not know who grav'd these characters?PEMBROKE.They are of much antiquity, here plac'dAs evidence of compact and good faithBetween the natives who resign'd the soilAnd British voyagers.—MOOR.—You greatly err,The hieroglyphic's clearly African;Now liberty has double charms in view!And if the guardian spirits leave me not,Perhaps this land, which terrible appear'd,Dark and unhallow'd as captivity,May yield me joys,—most precious joys of life!And prove the scene of earthly extacy.PEMBROKE.'Twere better to retire.—MOOR.—Despise me notFor these excessive contrasts of the mind!I fly despair to snatch the hand of hope;So ready is the human heart to seizeThe image of its wishes, and to quitThe terror of its woes!—forgive me, friends!From the idea which I last conceiv'd,New prospects open to my fancy's eye,The gloom breaks off, the vapour dissipates!PEMBROKE.Let us avoid the curiosityOf yonder females who observe our stay.MOOR.There's bounty in their looks, why should we fly?As they depart the stage, TERESA and AMELIA enter.TERESA.With them Antonio!—AMELIA.—And Pembroke too!TERESA.Who is that stately Moor we see attends?AMELIA.I have not heard.—TERESA.—As then we are alone,Let me unbosom to AmeliaMy anxious thoughts.—AMELIA.—What cares can now possessMy gracious mother's breast?—TERESA.—Draw near, my child;Hast thou observ'd in Laura's conduct aughtOf levity? and in unguarded hours,Doth she reveal a habitude of mindWhich shews a vicious tendency?AMELIA.—With me,Perhaps reserv'd, she may restrain her thoughts,And guard her conduct; but in virtue's causeFew can display more excellence of mind,In sentiments refin'd, and maxims pure;And such a chastity her speech doth grace,As would become the fairest Spanish dame.TERESA.Then all is well with thee!—AMELIA.—The question's strange.TERESA.I must dissemble, and appear to throwMy vague suspicions on her lover's side.
(aside)AMELIA.You muse, dear mother.—TERESA.—Yet I'm unresolv'd,Whether 'twere better not to wound your mindWith mere suspicions, whilst no facts are found,Or warn thee to beware.—AMELIA.—Of what?—of whom?TERESA.Of Laura.—AMELIA.—Would you then depreciate herWho holds my good opinion,—or accuseSome other?—TERESA.—Does Antonio never comeOn frivolous pretence, and fondly prate,Or waste in dalliance his idle hours,To trifle with the slave?—AMELIA.—You make me smile;Leave me to manage with Antonio.I cannot yield my mind to jealousy;It would degrade my own fair consequence,And so far lessen self-opinion too,That I should blush to own it:—credit me,The maiden's virtues to such shameful fraudAre as superior as light to shade;Ingratitude to her is yet unknown.
(Exit.)TERESA.She does not seem to apprehend my thoughts;It cannot be the governor should stoopSo low in vice, as to debase my bedWith such intrigue!—But still suspicion lurksWithin my mind, and jealousy once knownIs hard to be eradicated thence;Still feeding, like cameleons, on air,Maintaining an existence vile.—End of the SECOND ACT.ACT III. Scene, the Groves near the Governor's Palace.Enter ANTONIO with the MOOR.MOOR.I Mark'd his countenance, and tho' there seem'dA want of openness, simplicity,The character of truth, stood in his looks:His words were few, but pertinent and strong;And thence persuaded into confidence,I trusted one chief secret to his ear.ANTONIO.If nothing more was trusted, all is well.MOOR.You entertain some doubts.—ANTONIO.—HypocrisyCan mask the guileful measures of the heartWith fairest guise:—when he assumes too much,He gives distrust:—no outward show's requir'dBy virtue.—Tho' the homely dress deniesThe power of riches, avarice prevails,Lucre of gold, and traffic is his God.MOOR.Ha!—ANTONIO.—Next of kin to griping avariceIs fraud.—MOOR.Am I betray'd?—Has he deceiv'd?ANTONIO.Be not alarm'd; perhaps I doubt too much.MOOR.Attend,—are we perceiv'd?—can no one hear?All's safe.—In infancy my father plac'dHis first-born son with a most holy seer,The high-priest of the Gods, to educateIn all the sacred learning of the sage;Who, having gift of prophecy, would oftGaze on my face with tears, and cast his signs,To try if some good star might still prevailAgainst predestin'd evils, which he sawWrote in the book of fate; from study deepAnd science most divine, discoveringA favourable planet, he divulg'dHis thoughts.—ANTONIO.—I'm all attention.—MOOR.—"Still the Gods"Are willing to preserve thee from the woes"That shall beset thy steps; in time to come,"(Nor distant far the years) captivity"Shall be thy wretched fate.—A charm I hold"Will from the misery of that estate"Have power to liberate thee, if apply'd"With wisdom."—ANTONIO.—Strange anxiety pursuesThy story.—MOOR.—Straight he bound my trembling limbsFast to the sacred altar, and my eyesWith mystic fillet clos'd; then on my thighIncision made, and introduc'd the charm,Extorting vows, that, till occasion call'd,If there should rest conceal'd; and if such illAs was foretold might yet averted beBy pious works, or aid of powers above,That to the grave the holy boon I'd bear,Where he had plac'd it.—ANTONIO.—A prescienceAstonishing!—MOOR.—The dire event was come,And now the time and due occasion call'dFor this important gift to make its wayTo light, and give me liberty.—I toldThe secret to my friend, to Pembroke toldWhat gift I held; and tho' he would denyWhat superstition seem'd, he lent his hand,And with a lancet brought a jewel forthThat would have ransom'd all the slaves you hold.ANTONIO.'Tis well I know the secret of this trust;Perhaps he may prove faithful; but if not,I am thy witness to confront his fraud:So great a trust, for avarice to tempt,Will prove his virtue to its very source.MOOR.You see what inadvertency pursu'dThe strange event;—for had I known what charmThe holy priest bestow'd, more privacyWould have prevail'd:—but full of pious faith,I thought I merely held some mystic giftTo influence the powers invisible.ANTONIO.To what intent was Pembroke then to holdThe gem?—MOOR.—To change it into ready gold,Or borrow on its value what might serveFor my redemption, and supply the callsOf other exigence.—ANTONIO.—The time draws nearWhen 'tis accustom'd that the council sits.MOOR.You'll be my friend?ANTONIO.—Depend upon my word.MOOR.Whilst I look after Pembroke, should you meet,Use the intelligence as may seem best.ANTONIO.I'll see you at the hall—
(Exit Moor.)—A second claimCalls forth humanity.—The subtle knave!Should he betray the injur'd Moor in this,The act would prove of greater crueltyThan bondage.
(Exit.)The scene changes to the Governor's garden.LAURA enters alone.LAURA.How fruitless are our hopes!—my troubled heartSome gleams of consolation entertain'dTo soothe this gloomy lot of adverse life,In the attention and the gracious smilesTeresa shew'd her slave: but now, alas!Without offence, unconscious of the cause,I meet her frown austere, and angry prideSits low'ring on her brow.—JEROMEenters.—Still sunk in grief!In all her woe there's such a dignity,Such unfeign'd virtue shines from out her mind,As testifies superior sentiment.
(aside)Where haste you, Laura?LAURA.—That I may, my lord,Not interrupt your privacy.—JEROME.—Stay, stay!For I would speak to thee, would dry those tears,And cheer thy mind from its anxieties.LAURA.Permit me to retire.—JEROME.—Not with such speed.LAURA.It is not meet I talk here with my lord.JEROME.I wish to ask thee if thy gentle heartHas ever known the tender force of love?LAURA.Spare my confusion.JEROME.—Ever known the painOf cold indifference from one belov'd?LAURA.My lord!JEROME.The pangs of deep despondency,The anxious hope, and the impatient wish?LAURA.I tremble at your looks!—desist, my lord.JEROME.Fever'd desire, and tender languishment?LAURA.Nay hold me not.—JEROME.—But I will press thee thus,And whisper in thine ear my heart's fond tale.LAURA.Spare me, my lord, spare your poor abject slave.JEROME.I would not injure thee.—LAURA.—Then let me pass.JEROME.No, I must plant upon those velvet lipsTen thousand kisses.—LAURA.—Am I not your slave?Is yet my dreadful ruin incomplete,Whilst I retain one gift deriv'd of Heaven,My virtue?—JEROME.—Banish all thy fears, sweet maid;I will not rob thee.—LAURA.—That is gracious!JEROME.But I would take what gentle Laura's loveWould gen'rously dispose.—LAURA.—Alas! my lord,If I possess'd such quality of mindAs might your pity still have merited,It was my hatred of vile perfidy,My firm integrity, my steady truth,And yet unblotted fame.JEROME.—All these I love,Nor would I tempt thee into perfidy,But have thee true as magnet to the pole.LAURA.Then think of your Teresa, sacred nameOf wedded love.—JEROME.—Thy fair integrityI would not stain, nor virtue would seduce,But try t'engage them both on my behalf.LAURA.And break them with Amelia?—JEROME.—Thy truthI wish to center on our mutual love.LAURA.Forsaking vows which Heaven has long since heard,And on the tablet of the great SupremeWritten in characters emboss'd with stars!JEROME.Then thou hast lov'd?—LAURA.—And mourn it in despair.JEROME.And dost thou talk of virtue?—Afric's maidsAre not so coy.—LAURA.—Disgrace not your great mindWith sentiments so far beneath the castOf that high erudition you have known.In ev'ry clime fair virtue is the same;And tho' the vertic sun pours forth his beamsUpon the eastern world, and whilst the frostsWith torpid fetters bind the northern climes,Yet virtue has her sanctity in each:In each rever'd by Heaven, and priz'd on earth,Inestimable gift!—If pure is light,(God's emanation here)—if fair the moon,If bright the stars,—(those brilliant eyes of night)If heaven's blue vault's unspotted and serene,The great Supreme on purity must lookWith love divine.—JEROME.—To prate, to argue thus,Is to abuse the moment we possess:What I would win,—by force I might obtain;But I detest compulsion,—and will woo.TERESA and AMELIA enter at a side-bower.TERESA.You would divert my purpose, but behold,Are my suspicions vague?—JEROME.—If you will yieldTo my warm wishes, from this servitudeTo a far distant villa you shall move,And there enjoy your liberty.—LAURA.—Point out,My lord, my tomb, and bring the poison'd bowl,Then giving me my choice, I'll bless your name.JEROME.You must, you shall comply:—my ardent loveIs irresistible—and thus—
(Laura struggles.)LAURA.—Stand off,
(drawing a dagger.)I yet possess one guardian of my fame.AMELIA.Witness her virtue, and compassionateHer sufferings.—TERESA.—Shall we interfere,And save her rashness?—See the impious wretch!How mean is vice, how abject!—See, he kneels!JEROME.Stay thy rash hand, that threatens to destroyUs both.—LAURA.—I will retire.—And tho' I knowThis moment robs me of the hope of peace,And mixes my sad lot with other slaves;Yet with exulting soul I'll meet my fate,Resign these useless ornaments, this garb,To clasp within my arms the rags that cloathThe meanest wretch who in the mill-way works;And an approving mind shall smooth the taskWhich honour hath impos'd.JEROME.—It must not be;Nay, I'll e'en constrain thee.—LAURA.—This weak hand,Not rais'd against its master, holds enoughOf vigour to release me.—She retires—whilst JEROME stands meditating.AMELIA.—Let us go,'Twere better he should recollect himself:We must not meet him now.TERESA.—Not meet him, girl!Yes, I will rouse him from his lethargy,That he may not avail himself again,And my attention wickedly divertBy vile insinuations, to the spoilOf fairer characters.—AMELIA.—'Tis as I thought!TERESA approaches JEROME, whilst he stands lost in reverie.TERESA.Is this well done, my lord?—Doth this becomeThe mighty ruler of these provinces,On whose example, and wise governmentDepend a people's welfare?—JEROME.—You're in wrath.TERESA.Was it for this the nobles of my houseGave you my hand?—And I could condescendWith a plebeian race to mix the bloodOf the illustrious name of Alicant.JEROME.For what, Teresa?—TERESA.—The indignity,My eyes, my ears sustain'd, to see thee courtThat odious wretch, and hear her high contemptOf the vile bargain that thy lust would make,To barter for her virtue.—JEROME.—So it befalsImpertinent, base curiosity;Its fingers in the mischief sure will soilWherewith it intermeddles.—TERESA.—Well, my lord!JEROME.It is not well; you should have seen much moreEe'r you had charg'd me with the infamyYour words express.—TERESA.—Effrontery as vileAs the debased habits of your heart.Amelia!—JEROME.—Conspiracy like thisDenies all temperance:—to save my rageSome dire and hasty act, I'll snatch myselfFrom the detested scene.—
(Exit.)AMELIA.—As I much fear'd,Sad sorrow must ensue.—TERESA.—My injures!AMELIA.Patience, dear mother! yet no intercourseHas taken place to your dishonour;—And Laura is as chaste as light.—TERESA.—The slaveMust be dispos'd, nor longer here retain'd;I hate the swarthy elf that could seduceMy husband's wishes from his lawful bed.AMELIA.Alas! poor Laura!—What adversity,What unprovok'd adversity, has fill'dThy miserable fortune!—Where,—to whomShall she be trusted, that her virtuous soulMay not be overwhelm'd in wretchedness?TERESA.She must depart this land, and that with speed,Before the governor suspects my thoughts.
(Exit.)AMELIA, crossing the stage, meets ANTONIO.ANTONIO.I am become your pious convert now,And entertain a judgment that's so fix'dConcerning those poor wretches we enslave,That I have vow'd, no effort of my lifeShall be refus'd to remedy their ills.Before the governor will soon be heldA bold appeal, by one whom we brought here;Whose sentiments and soul are so sublime,They touch'd me with compassion and surprize,AMELIA.What is his claim?—ANTONIO.—His liberty:—but firstCertain insignia which he possestWhen he was put on board; from thence, he says,Will much intelligence be gain'd, of whomAnd whence he is.—AMELIA.—I find within my heartAn interest arise:—Whose slave is he?ANTONIO.The captain's—and I should not wonder muchIf some atrocious acts are brought to lightThat hurt commercial faith in Africa,And greatly add to detestation here.AMELIA.Thy friendship and compassion now I claimFor wretched Laura, whom misfortunes stillCease not to persecute.—ANTONIO.—You may commandMy services—I know her virtuous mind;I know her soul's superior to the lotThe adverse stars have destin'd her.—AMELIA.—The taleOf her increas'd afflictions must revealSome of the sorrows of this troubled house.ANTONIO.Can sorrow lift her footsteps then so high?AMELIA.Shame scarce permits the tale:—the governorHath look'd upon the girl with impious eyes;My mother's heart is fir'd with jealousy;And for our household peace, poor Laura's fateIs pre-determin'd:—she must leave this land;It will be mov'd to Calaban or youTo take her hence:—if so, protect the maid,That when this folly of my father's mindSubsides, I may redeem her, and againExtend some consolation to her woes.ANTONIO.It is not safe to trust her to the handsOf that nefarious wretch, whose brutal senseOf female character is odious.If she's consign'd to me, I'll place her safeIn some secure retreat, whence you may callYour Laura at your pleasure.—AMELIA(starts.)—That's the voiceOf my enraged father; we'll retire.
(Exeunt.)Enter JEROME and his freedman ZANGAE.JEROME.Thus foil'd by weak and whining women too,Exceeds all patience.—ZANGAE.—Thence, what would my lord?JEROME.I know Teresa's Spanish pride's on fire,And jealousy will fan the subtle flame:To try t'appease her mind, and save the slaveFrom her vindictive temper, is in vain.Watch thou their steps —ZANGAE.—Attentively.—JEROME.—ContriveTo sound their purpose:—if the angry dameAttempt to banish Laura, or exchange,(For nothing's difficult to such proud minds)Raise such immediate force as may sufficeTo rescue her, and in some secret holdSecure her, till you know my further will.ZANGAE.I will fulfil your wish.—JEROME.—You to your charge,I to the council-house:—this little trustShall not go unrewarded.
(Exeunt.)End of the THIRD ACT.ACT IV. Scene the Court before the Senate-house.Enter ANTONIO and the MOOR.MOOR.SUCH is the subtlety of this man's mind,That to disarm me of my chief pretext,As he conceives, on an appeal to justice,He has restor'd me these habiliments;But with rapacious hand has torn from thenceThose ensigns which my injuries explain;The evidence which might maintain my cause,My tablets, in whose records stood enroll'dMy country and my name.—ANTONIO.—Will you declineThe application which you had design'd,And trust to Pembroke's ransoming?—MOOR.—I think'Twere better to try both.ANTONIO.—I wait your will.MOOR.If from the force of truth I might prevail,If Heaven should send some unforeseen relief,Or move by secret influence the mindsOf those whom we address, more honour standsConfess'd than when the price that liberatesThe meanest son of slavery obtainsThe indiscriminate effect.—ANTONIO.—Behold,The council sits,—draw near and make thy plea.The back scene opens, and discovers the governor and dele∣gates of the province in council: several planters, CAL∣ABAN and others, attending.The MOOR approaches, making obeisance after the fashion of his country.MOOR.With sacred awe and pious reverenceThis high tribunal I approach; I'm toldHere Heaven's vicegerents sitting to dispense,As secondary causes, wise decrees,Will judge my plaints, and my petition hear:If justice holds a balance that defiesAll undue influence, and pois'd aloftPreponderates alone to truth, reportWill not have trifled with my miseries.Behold the victim of an adverse fateBends with humility before the seatOf government, and tho' an African,Craves for the common benefit of lawsThat scorn partiality—JEROME.—Proceed to stateThe grievances you hope we may redress:Justice and right humanity's great causeAre not confin'd to subjects of this land,But from the jurisprudence of the stateAre equally the claim of all mankind.MOOR.Brought here by force, and from my country torn,By one who steer'd his vessel to our coasts;Depriv'd of property, and suff'ring illsWhich shock the human ear in their detail;Should he not shew on what pretence of rightHe perpetrates such deeds?—JEROME.—Call forth the man.1st COUNSEL.Wherefore do you detain the Moor?CALABAN.—I boughtThe slave.—MOOR.—'Tis false.—2d COUNSEL.—Your supercargo callTo prove the fact.—CALABAN.—If you hold out this law,The trade is much in jeopardy; each slaveMay controvert the truth, and call for proofsThe navigator never thought to have.JEROME.Was this man gain'd by private sale, or camePromiscuously with other slaves?—CALABAN.—Alone.1st COUNSEL.Have you no witnesses?—CALABAN.—If such I had,I would not for the fatal precedentProduce them here.—2d COUNSEL.—Where is the supercargo?—ANTONIO.I know not whence, or how he was obtain'd;When first I saw him, on the deck he lay,Benumb'd, and totally depriv'd of sense,By some most powerful dose of opiate;His garb uncommon led me to enquireConcerning him, but no intelligenceWas gain'd.—JEROME.—What sayest thou?MOOR.—Your patient earMust hear captivity's unhappy tale;As little hope depends on passions mov'd,The influence I seek is truth.—1st COUNSEL.—To facts,And not to flow'ry phrase, confine your plea.MOOR.The former year, by some rapacious bands,(A roving tribe that rang'd the forest's skirtsIn search of captives to supply the tradeWhich Europeans hold) the scatter'd tentsOf princes hunting, and by females held,Were sack'd and pillag'd, and the familiesWere driven to the shores, and sold for slaves.Of them a maid, whom love had made my own,And sacred rites had form'd our union:This sad catastrophe I much had mourn'd,And, tho' despair possess'd my aching heart,In th' ensuing season I came downTo Niger's banks, and pass'd the friendly statesWith slender equipage, not fearing ill;That if enquiry might my grief allay,And I could learn where the dear maid was gone,I might redeem her.—JEROME.—What ensu'd?MOOR.—I broughtSome gems of price, gold dust, and ivory,To influence such navigators heartsAs might be there.—1st COUNCIL.—An influence, 'tis true,But often misapply'd—MOOR.—It was my fateTo meet a foe like aligator bred,Amphibious, whose savage love of preyAlike by land or water rag'd:—I toldMy anxious tale with tears,—and might have weptUnto some statue cut of Parian stoneAnd rais'd as much emotion:—for his heartNor felt compassion, nor compunction's touch;But from my tent deluding with such catesAs his pernicious cookery prepar'dIn specious friendship and for banquet gay,I drank a poison that straight reach'd my brain,And lock'd up ev'ry sense in mimic death;Then seizing on my treasures, seizing tooMy wretched person:—you behold the man!JEROME.What says the captain?—CALABAN.—All the tale is false;And frantic with his sorrows, here he ravesOf objects which a being never knew.JEROME.How was the gold and ivory bestow'd?MOOR.We touch'd at many places in our voyage.1st COUNSEL.Did you dispose of merchandise?—ANTONIO.—We did;The captain too of ivory and gems.JEROME.What territory did you leave,—or whomShall we believe you are?—MOOR.—My lords, my birthWas of Cassaena, and my station thereSuperior:—to talk of dignitiesWould ill befit my fortune thus revers'd.Look on the clasp that girds my turban's front,Where stands engraven the illustrious namesOf the bright sun that rules the golden day;On every stud, the characters of starsThat fill the firmament;—my pedigreeThey note.—JEROME.—Is here an African to proveOne fact insisted on?—MOOR.—Without a friendYou see the suffering Moor:—if that great eyeOf nature, where the radiant seraph sitsDispensing God's benevolence, could pierceThe stubborn heart of man with rays divine,There need not evidence.—JEROME.—Was Zangae here,He'd give some information.—1st COUNSEL.—See the manEntranc'd and prostrate!—JEROME.—What occasion movesThis veneration? —ZANGAE,—I behold my prince,The great Manzara; of Cassaena's realmThe mighty potentate; a thousand statesSurround his throne, and to his sceptre bow.MANZARA.Who is it owns Manzara?—ZANGAE.—E'en a MoorFrom Africa estrang'd, who once obey'dThy sov'reignty, and gloried in the nameOf vassal in Cassaena's wealthy land.MANZARA.Thou knowest then the titles that I bear.ZANGAE.The names inscrib'd are of thy ancestors,Whom the prophetic priests in originDeduc'd from the bless'd Sun, whose daughters fairRule each a star in heaven, whilst you on earthKnow not the limits of your vast domain.MANZARA.Look on that scymeter, and read aloud.ZANGAE."May the Supreme with great Manzara walk,"Whose mighty kingdoms neither Cancer girds,"Nor Capricorn with tropic limit bounds."1st COUNSEL.The evidence is singular,—MANZARA.—The lightOf heaven prevails!—the servants of the SunDescend to bless the intellectual mind,And bring forth holy truth!—JEROME.—So very clearThe case, and the discovery so strange,We cannot hesitate to liberateThe injur'd prince;—and henceforth you are free.MANZARA.I reverence at once your happy laws,And the just dispensation that's display'd.Thanks are indignities to your high trust;For to such sentence, thanks would but prescribeThe bounds of bounty; whilst the center form'dBy justice is without perimeter.To prove my mind's not heated for revenge,The chief possession of the earth regain'd—My liberty; my goods esteem'd as trashI yield to his possession:—to the GodsThat brought about this wonderful eventI give the rest; vindictive power is theirs.Exeunt Governor, Council, &c. &c.ZANGAEkneels.Look on poor Zangae, on your humble slave,Whose most ambitious wish could never soarTo such exalted duty, or his hopeConceive this glorious service, that he shouldRedeem his prince.MANZARA.—Arise, my faithful friend;If thou wilt henceforth my misfortunes share,Thou shalt be in my bosom as the giftOf Heaven, by miracle dispos'd to saveCassaena's captive lord.—ZANGAE.—By strongest bondsOf gratitude I serve the governor.If he—'tis more than I may ask!—my heartIs rent with woe, whilst duty holds my stay;For if I follow not my prince, my soul'sIn grief:—and if my lord I should forsake,As faithless,—I should thence unworthy grow.MANZARA.Hereafter I will move it:—still remainIn that distinguish'd service; to his ear,As the occasion serves, to speak of me;And thence facilitate my measures here.Didst thou e'er know Zanfara's beauteous maid?ZANGAE.'Tis now five years since I became a slave;I knew her not.—
(retires.)MANZARA.—Go and remember me.
(Exit Zangae.)ANTONIO.Warmer congratulations I could giveWere Pembroke here.—MANZARA.—From this first great eventMuch force will be deriv'd; he'll never dareTo injure me.—But as precautions safe,Let us look after him; there's no successAttends delay: I wish to hire a shipTo carry me again to Gambia's streams;There's danger always in a foreign state.ANTONIO.Our thoughts still correspond, let us move on.
ExeuntEnter JEROME and PEMBROKE.PEMBROKE.Much secrecy is not requir'd, the factAlready is too public;—th' alarmAffects the planters much: conspiracyHas been discover'd, and a double guardIn some plantations now is necessary.JEROME.What cause to charge Manzara with the crime?PEMBROKE.His name is gone abroad; some slaves were broughtFrom his dominions, and he oft was seenIn secret converse, pleading earnestlyWith much gesticulation.—JEROME.—To receiveSuch vague report and information voidOf proof will not induce the legislative powerTo interfere.—There is a dignityIn this much-injur'd man that proves itself;Such perspicuity in all his phrase,As shews an erudition none but thoseOf the first consequence could e'er attain:We are not left to doubt his high estate;From a full sense of those base injuriesHe has sustain'd, we gave him liberty;And now to charge him with such heinous crimesAgainst the state, is singular.—PEMBROKE.—'Twas IThat pledg'd his ransom to relieve his chains;'Twas I that mov'd him to his late appeal;And is it possible, without a cause,I should accuse the man whom I espous'd?JEROME.The circumstance appears to me so dark,That I distrust what I can't comprehend.PEMBROKE.I hate the name of slavery, and aidEmancipation by all powerful means:But whilst humanity promotes one cause,Another it preserves,—my country's weal:When I discover'd that this bosom heldSo treacherous a thought as mutinyAmong the slaves, and in its consequenceSubversion of the government, and spoilOf individuals, I straightway turn'dAttention to his plots, and found him out.JEROME.How found him out?—PEMBROKE.—I held his confidence,And when he had enlarg'd on golden dreams,And promises of Afric's wealth, he own'dRevenge rag'd in his heart; a wish to gainRetaliation for his country's woes,And to let loose a bloody hand,—t'appeaseThe horror which he saw imprest me deep,He talk'd of vast rewards.—JEROME.—In consequenceOf confidence like this, would'st thou impeach,On the mere strength of thy veracity,This stranger prince?—PEMBROKE.—If justice should require,The deepest secret of my bosom yieldsTo public good.—But see, Horatio comes,Perhaps he bears yet more important truths.HORATIO enters.JEROME.Are your slaves peaceable?—HORATIO.—I am in fear;They gather in cabals, and sullen seem,Working reluctantly. —JEROME.—But are there groundsTo doubt conspiracy?—HORATIO.—My spies reportThat some strange faction has possess'd their minds;Their priests exhort with vehemence; and oftThey sing the war-song, and they hail their prince,Whom they rejoice is landed on our coast.JEROME.This may alarm:—but have you cause to chargeManzara as a secret instrument,Or as the object of the people's joy?HORATIO.I have inquir'd; my spies know not his name.MARTINOenters.We must intreat the aid of government,Ten thousand slaves now threaten a revolt;Through my plantation strange commotions reign,And all my trusty servants fly to arms.Perhaps upon assembling of the troops,This ferment may subside.HORATIO.—If not suppress'dWith an immediate hand, none can foreseeThe fatal consequence a night may bring.JEROME.What cause appears?—MARTINO.—We have discover'd none.JEROME.I shall convene the council.—
(Planters retire)PEMBROKE.—Thus you seeTh' intelligence is prov'd by circumstance.Were it not best to put the Moor in chains?JEROME.It may be necessary.—PEMBROKE.—If th' offenceOn full investigation is disprov'd,He'll stand discharg'd: and no great injurySustaining, may depart:—but when compar'd,The consequences fear'd, with his arrest,The latter's light as air.—JEROME.—I stand convinc'd,The project's right.—PEMBROKE.—There's of his nation hereMore than your Zangae now at liberty;For as we loiter'd in the shady groveAdjacent to your palace, where the rockIs sculptur'd with mysterious characters.—JEROME.My heart's alarm'd?—
(aside.)PEMBROKE.—And whilst he stood and wept,He told me, in an agony of mind,That there he read a history of woe.JEROME.He read!—PEMBROKE.—The graving's of familiar mode.JEROME.My passions are on fire.—
(aside.)PEMBROKE.—And when his mindWas all absorb'd, forgetting I was there,He kneel'd, and in an extacy grief,Thrice call'd aloud, in his own dialect,Jaqueena!—JEROME.—Ha!—PEMBROKE.—As if he would invokeSome demon, and the fiends of Africa.JEROME.I have let loose the eagle to destroyThe firstlings of my flock!—
(aside.)PEMBROKE.—I touch his soul;That was the boldest spring I had to move,I must not overstrain it.—
(aside.)JEROME.—You adviseTo put the Moor in durance?—PEMBROKE.—True, I do.JEROME.Proceed then to enquire into the facts,That justice strictly be administer'd.
(Exit Pembroke.)This is a foe I never once had fear'd;Jaqueena is the maid whom he laments,For whom he lost his liberty:—To him,Or to a legion of the Negro tribe,I'll not resign her:—for my heart is her's;Nor Spanish pride, nor Afric's haughty sons,Shall from my anxious bosom wrest the maid.ZANGAEenters.My lord, the plot is laid; and to the handsOf Calaban, poor Laura's doom'd to pass:Some island of the Indies is agreedTo be her place of bondage:—I have learntThe hour of their departure.—JEROME.—Then take careTo have the necessary means prepar'd,Not only of her safety, but to bearHer to my distant villa with all speed,There wait my coming.—ZANGAE.—Trusty slaves attendTo execute your will.—JEROME.—My confidenceIs plac'd in thee.—
(Exit Zangae.)—The Moor shall lose his hopes,Teresa her revenge; and if my powerServes not to gratify my will in this,There's no superiority is worthThe labours that attend on government.End of the FOURTH ACT.ACT V. Scene, the Groves adjoining the Governor's Palace.Enter JEROME and ANTONIO.ANTONIO.YOU are deceiv'd and trifled with,—the princeHas a sublimity of mind, superiorTo stratagems like these.—JEROME.—It was a chargeSo grounded, and the facts establishedBy proofs so strong, I could not hesitateTo send him into durance, till we heardThe slaves were peaceful, and the tumult hush'd.ANTONIO.There was no tumult.—JEROME.—All Martino's slavesHad mutinied.—ANTONIO.—There never was more peaceThan at the instant;—not a voice was heardThrough the plantation.—JEROME.—And Horatio's menCaball'd, refus'd to labour, and had sungThe war-song.—ANTONIO.—All a fiction,—all is false;A tale just calculated to reduce the priceOf my imported cargo, by adviceOf Pembroke, to affect the planters mindsWith terror, and prevent their bargainingIn times of pressing danger.—JEROME.—Both gave proofIn charge against Manzara.—ANTONIO.—I repeatYou were abus'd; they knew not why he broughtThem hither, but propos'd such tale to them,For the base purpose, I declare, they knewNo tittle of the charge against the prince:Read there,—they certify the fact.—
(gives a paper.)JEROME.—Good Heav'nProtect us from such wiles!—what could induceThe villain to these practices?—ANTONIO.—A hopeOf robbing the afflicted prisoner,Avoiding justice, and escaping hence,With such a booty as his avariceCould not resist:—IntegrityIs a mere outside semblance he assumes,To mask a soul replete with darkest fraud.JEROME.I know not what's alluded to.—ANTONIO.—A fact,Will strike you with abhorrence;—having plac'dMuch confidence in this perfidious wretch,He to his care entrusted a rich gem,By which he might his ransom and returnObtain;—in order, with impunity,To rob the captive stranger he procur'dFirst, his imprisonment by a false charge,Then got on board a ship prepar'd to sailFor Spain.—JEROME.—My soul is griev'd,—I've been deceiv'd,And to sad inadvertencies betray'd.ANTONIO.Which soon may be retriev'd.—JEROME.—There is my doubt.ANTONIO.The prince may be restor'd to liberty.JEROME.My heart is now with much compunction smote.ANTONIO.What moves you thus?—JEROME.—Proceed—did he escape?ANTONIO.Hearing of these transactions, and inform'dOf the great trust, I got an officerTo go on board and seize the treacherous knave,Just as the sails were bent, and tide had serv'dTo carry him to sea.—JEROME.—With equal speedSend to the prison, and release the Moor.ANTONIO.Your Zangae comes this way.—
(Zangae enters.)JEROME.—'Tis opportune,Haste and release the Moor, —if yet he lives.
(Exit Zangae.)ANTONIO.Is there a doubt?—You wound my tortur'd soul!—Is there a fear?—JEROME.—But of the precious gem?ANTONIO.For the poor prince I'm all anxiety.JEROME.What the event?—ANTONIO.—The man, suspecting notThat I was privy to the trust, retain'dThe stone, nor try'd to hide his purpos'd fraudBy throwing it in the sea; on search,We found it in his bosom:—evidenceSufficient to the magistrate appear'dTo cast him into prison;—see the priceOf his iniquity.
(produces the jewel)
My heart's distress'd,I tremble for the Moor!—JEROME.—To this dread chargeThe villain wrought upon my guilty mind,With such insinuations of the loveManzara entertain'd or had avow'dFor Laura, and his purpose to withdrawThe maid from hence;—that—ANTONIO.—The fair interestWhich Laura claims in her Manzara's breast,Might warrant all that Pembroke could devise;But she is ignorant,—so is the Moor,That they're so near a wish'd for intercourse.JEROME.My conscience is disturb'd;—I own my crimes,And wish that retribution could be had:The guilty passions were inflam'd with love,Unlawful as it was;—my jealousyWas basely rous'd,—and vengence fill'd my mind:Under pretext of service to the state,By my removing an obnoxious Moor,Who would an insurrection have stir'd upAmong the slaves,—I sent my mandate forth.ANTONIO.What was its tenor?—for I dread the blow.JEROME.That in the prison they should strangle him.ANTONIO.Oh horrid cruelty!—Oh innocenceThat suffers mighty woes!—A captive here,Drag'd from his country, and a diadem!By Calaban ensnar'd,—and now betray'dTo death!—What dreadful crimes we perpetrate!And yet the vengeance of offended HeavenIs long with-held?—JEROME.(Looking out.)
—Oh! Zangae comes alone.ANTONIO.Then he is dead!—JEROME.—And on my guilty headThe blood of innocence is fall'n.—ANTONIO.(Looking out.)

(Exit Zangae.)MANZARA.So long inur'd to injury and chains,Methinks, the powers of Heaven have so decreedThey are my lot for life!—What further woesWould you inflict?—behold your victim standsTo hear the judgment you'll again pronounce.I have no more than life itself to lose!By men of your complexion, whose cold soulsAre frozen up in ice, I lost my realm,My wife, my country, and my liberty!Now to accomplish all, spare not the poorVile remnant of possession, spare it not!But send this soul to join my ancestors,Who hover for me on the mountain's top!Where is the executioner?—be quick,For I am weary, and would be at rest.JEROME.Not to increase thy injuries or woes,But to redress them, art thou brought.—MANZARA.—I heardA voice say, "thou hast liberty," and straightThe shackles of a slave were taken off:No sooner I possess'd the sacred bliss,Than I endur'd the manacles prepar'dFor criminals: —so momentary proveThe smiles of fortune in Manzara's fate!JEROME.With my own hands I take these fetters off;And in my arms, with cordial embrace,Insure thee of protection.—ANTONIO.—It's with griefThe governor perceives how multiply'dWere your misfortunes, and his gracious heartIs warm'd to do you service.—JEROME.ConfidentI need not doubt thy faith, this scymeter'sRestor'd; an ornament, for no rude causeWill urge thee to its use.MANZARA.I bless the godsThis happy change takes place! perhaps once moreCassaena's distant land I may behold!ANTONIO.To heighten this new prospect of your peace,Behold the gem regain'd.MANZARA.I fear the change(So rapid a transition) is not builtOn stable ground-work!—If my gracious lordWill lend assistance for our hiring henceA vessel to Great Britain's wealthy isle,Where an illustrious king, as the broad sun,Shines forth amidst the council of the starsTo animate the world, dispenses roundThe influence of wisdom; thence we'll learnSage maxims for our government, and safePass to Cassaena's lov'd and mourning land:You'll thence repay me richly for the woesI have sustain'd within your territories.JEROME.I joy to give you pleasure; to your wishI'll give all aid; a passage shall be gain'dFor England.—
(Exit Jerome.)MANZARA.—Sure the frowns of angry fateBegin to dissipate!—ANTONIO.—What means that noise,Those seamen in such rage?—MANZARA.—New dangers riseTo crowd the motley character of life,Manzara suffers!—to the Governor,(laying his hand on his sword.)For this fast friend, unnumber'd thanks are due.ANTONIO.In conflict with the Governor's own slaves,Headed by Zangae:—hark!—those female cries!A party of sailors under Calaban, come skirmishing on to the stage, with a number of Negro servants headed by Zangae,—Calaban dragging Laura.MANZARA.Did I not think Jaqueena was in heaven,I should believe the hapless victim sheWhom the vile monster holds:—her semblance firesMy soul, and for her sake I'll not permitThe rape;—desist, thou miscreant, or feelThe vengeance of my arm!—CALABAN.—Come on, and tryThy valour, and my rage.—They engage, Manzara drives him off the stage, and the seamen retreat.Enter AMELIA.—Led by the criesOf some afflicted female—Oh, my Laura!LAURA sinks into her arms.LAURA.Tremendous was the spectacle!—from HeavenDescended my deliverer, the prince!Cassaena's lord!—my husband!—overcomeWith such astonishment, I scarce retainThe breath of life, but faint and giddy grown,Must sink into thy bosom.—AMELIA.—WonderfulIs all thy story! but if this eventBe as thou wouldst imagine, Heaven will endThy griefs.—MANZARA enters, holding the head of CALABAN by the hair.—To the incensed manes of my fire,To the blest spirits of Zanfara's house,And first to thee Jaqueena, who in HeavenLooks down approving this my just revenge,I offer up the sacrifice!—
(Gazing on JAQUEENA as she lies fainting in the arms of AMELIA.)—Ye stars!Are not my senses in delusion lost?Do not my eyes on some bright vision look,That represents her sweet angelic form?
(kneels.)Thou seraph! daughter of the golden day!Awake, and bless me with thy conscious gaze!LAURA.Should I escape that monster Calaban,More brutal, more unfeeling than the wolf;If yet the Governor desists from wiles,And my poor virtue—all that I possess,Is spar'd,—that holy spirits may not turn awayThe face abash'd, and from their realms of lightExpel and thrust me forth.—MANZARA.—Where wanders thusHer recollection? yet, she knows me notLAURA.If my Manzara, in his gracious arms,Shall lift me to the grave—I die content!And sure his vision blest my swimming eyes,Or play'd upon my fancy with delight!
(gazing on him.)—My judgment is so shaken, that I knowNot what, or where I am!—MANZARA.—Behold, my queen,The gracious spirits that prevail on earthTransported me beyond our hemisphere,That I might save my better part, my love,And give her back to Africa and joy.AMELIA.Look where Manzara kneels:—alas! through griefA frenzy has derang'd her gentle mind!For yet she recollects not!—LAURA(gazing on Manzara.)—What sad woesHath my poor heart endur'd!—I lost my love!And with these eyes beheld the tragic scene,Where my dear mother with her infant fell,And welter'd in their gore!—my brother dy'dWithin these trembling arms in agonies!Snatch'd from my country, I'm become a slave,The prey of tyranny and lust!—'tis he!I know his godlike features!—I beholdThe great the good Manzara:—On thy breastLet me expire with joy!—
(flies into his arms.)JEROMEenters.—Where is the Moor?My servants have done well:—a vessel waitsTo carry him from hence:—the sails unfurl'd,The winds blow fair, and Heaven propitious smiles.MANZARA.Yes!—Heaven now smiles in my Jaqueena's eyes!And all past sorrows are extinguish'dIn this vast flood of joy!—LAURA.—But see,—he comesTo claim his property!—ANTONIO.—He comes, dear maid,To give your hand to your beloved lord,And bless your wishes —JEROME.—With abundant joy,I yield you to the prince; and pray to Heaven,That in the little services I pay,I may atone for those sad injuriesTo which I have too much contributed.—ZANGAE.Zangae must suffer yet a living death!Sever'd once more from his most gracious king;Deny'd his native land, become more dearBy wishes thus renew'd.JEROME.If the good princeRequests thy services, I will resignMy faithful Zangae, that a wish of hisMay not be unaccomplish'd.MANZARA.You o'erpowerMy gratitude.LAURA.My lord—these tides of joyExceed my strength—
(pointing to the seat by the rock.)There let me rest awhile,Where oft I sat to weep, and worshippedThe kindred spirits, whose beloved namesI sculptur'd on the rock.MANZARA.—Your fainting eyeDistracts me, and cold apprehensions chillMy heart.—LAURA.My joy had swept from memoryThe most afflicting sorrows of my soul;I still have much to tell of misery.MANZARA.When we are thus restor'd to liberty!When hope, with wing than lightning yet more swift,Anticipates the sight of Afric's shores,And Heaven, that heard our vows, protects our love.LAURA.My heart grows sick—my eye's obscur'd by mists,And darkness and confusion cloud my mind.Oh my Amelia!—Fate has cruel been,And unrelenting!—MANZARA.—What of grief remains?AMELIA.Your tears distress me deeply!—wherefore weep?Manzara lives, and you have liberty!LAURA.Draw near, beloved prince,—and let me pourMy woes into thy soul!—Oh! hear the taleThat disappoints my joys,—and pity me!MANZARA.Most holy Heavens! what sorrows yet existTo aggrandize the griefs I have endur'd?LAURA.Well knowing that Teresa's jealousyWould soon expose me to some cruel change,And melancholy having seiz'd my mind,For long I thought Manzara lost to me,I straight determin'd to avoid the fateOf falling into Calaban's rude hands,Nor yet submit to the impietyWhich mov'd the Governor:—the wretched worldHad lost all joys, and hope her sportive wing,That us'd the youthful fancy oft to charmWith visions soft as sweet.—AMELIA.—Why cease you there,And leave us in this anxious suspense?LAURA.The tardy floods of life forget to flow;I faint.—MANZARA.—Assist ye spirits of the air!And with refreshing breath of Heav'n renewHer strength.—LAURA.—Manzara! oh much lov'd lord!From whose dear image fancy never stray'd;Imprest upon this heart thy character,Which love conceiv'd, nor day nor night remov'd:Thou wert the vision of my happiest dream,And in the gloom of the detested cell,As o'er the vast Atlantic we were borne,And when America her slave receiv'd,Thou held my thoughts, and all my wishes fill'd!But hope was fled, and black despair was come;Whilst death alone held out a saving hand:Rash was the deed, and hapless it has prov'd,(The gods condemn my want of confidence)The poison, which my bracelet long conceal'd,Was—AMELIA.—Horrible, and heart distracting tale!MANZARA.Then all my wish'd for happiness is fled,And launch'd again upon the stormy seaOf wretchedness, new fortunes I must try;Pleasures sweet prospects Africa has lost!Manzara is undone!AMELIA.Haste for assistance, Zangae,—med'cineMay yet relieve—LAURA.—Impossible!The bane is of such subtle quality,Compounded by Zanfara's wisest dames,It scorns repelling powers!—the hand of deathLies heavy on my heart;—and every nerveAches with convulsion.—ANTONIO.—Her approaching fatePrecipitates!—MANZARA.—Oh misery extreme!All the monition's lost, which thy fair handInscrib'd upon the rocks, that might have ledTo thy discovery and sav'd despair!There Pembroke too deceiv'd!—and I, employ'dToo much on selfish views, neglected thoseThat should have sav'd us both!—but 'tis too late!LAURA.Whilst there is life, indulge me with thy gaze,That my departing soul, replete with love,May bear thy image to the latest breath,E'er I shall pass to Heaven!—ZANGAE returns with Physicians.ANTONIO.—Assistance comesToo late!—MANZARA.—Alas! she faints!—she dies!—tis done!AMELIA.And all our wishes disappointment blights!JEROME.Like some blest saint who confident in GodRefuses earth one groan!—MANZARA.—Do I neglectThe great example, and stay lingering here,Sustaining such extremity of woe?JEROME.If ever more authority I shew,It is to wrest thee from this sad despair.
(seizes his arm.)ANTONIO.To save much rashness let thy slave receiveThis scymeter, yet stain'd with mortal deeds.(Zangae removes the sword.)MANZARA.I know not what to do!—Oh sweet remains,Adieu!—a long adieu!—If you retain
(to Antonio.)Compassion for my woes, embalm the corpse,That Africa may yet receive its own.We must depart,—must tear ourselves from hence,(to Jerome.)The scene of so much terror and distress!Zangae shall be the partner of my tears:Tho' seas may shake the helm,—tho' adverse windsMay hang upon the dilatory sail;Perhaps relenting fates will yet retainSome pity for the Moor,—that he may landOn native shores,—and there erect on highA monument, that shall command the heartsOf our posterity (whilst man exists)To an abhorrence of the Trade in Slaves.FINIS.
