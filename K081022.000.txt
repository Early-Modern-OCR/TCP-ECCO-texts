I could not therefore  taking Advantage of this Opportunity, to  knowledge, publickly, all these Favours; and to assure You, that I amYour Lordship's most Obliged, Most Obedient, and Very Humble Servant,
HENRY JONETo Mr. HENRY JONES, on his Tragedy of the Earl of ESSEX.AS ancient Heroes are renown'd in Song,For rescuing Virtue from th'Oppressor's Wrong,So shall thy Fame, who snatch'd this well-wrought Tale,From Dulness' gloomy Pow'r, o'er Time prevail.Long had these Scenes, wound up with dext'rous Art,In spight of Reason, gain'd upon the Heart;Thaw'd ev'ry frozen Fountain of the Eye,We wept, 'till even Sorrow's self was dry;Yet Judgment scorn'd what Passion had approv'd,And the Head wonder'd, how the Heart was mov'd,But, with a Fate revers'd, thy Work shall boast,That soundest Judgments shall admire it most,Cloath'd in the easy Grandeur of thy Lines,The Story brightens, as the Diction shines.Renew'd with Vigour as in Age 'tis grown,The wond'ring Scene sees Beauties not it's own.Thus, worn with Years, in Afric's sultry Vales,The crested Snake shifts off his tarnish'd Scales;Assumes fresh Beauties, brighter than the old,Of changing Colours, intermix'd with Gold:Reburnish'd, basks beneath the scorching Ray,Shines with new Glories in the Face of Day,arts fiercer Lightning from his brandish'd Tongue,olls more sublime, and seems, at least, more young.No more shall Noise, and wild, bombastic Ragesurp th' applauding Thunder of the Stage;ustain no more shall pass for true Sublime,or Nonsense musically float in Rhime;or, in a worse Extreme, shall creeping Prose,or Nature and Simplicity, impose:
By thee reform'd, each vicious Taste shall fail,And Critic Justice hold aloft her Scale.Whence beams this dazling Lustre on thy Mind?Whence this vast Fund of Knowledge in Mankind,Unletter'd Genius? Whence hast thou been taughtThis Dignity of Stile, this Majesty of Thought,This rapid Fire, by cool Correctness rul'd,And ev'ry learned Elegance, unschool'd?Say, hath great Shakespear's transmigrated ShadeInform'd thy Mass, or lent thee friendly Aid?To him, bless'd Bard! untaught, 'twas also giv'n,T' ascend, on native Wings, Invention's brightest Heaven,
Alluding to the Prologue to Henry V.Assuming Phoebus' Port; and, in his Train,The Muses all, like Handmaids, not in vain,Crouch for Employment.—The Passions too, subservient to his Will,Attentive wait on his superior Skill;At the Command of his inchanting Art,Unlock the bursting Flood-gates of the Heart,And in the rapid, headlong Stream, bear downThe vanquish'd Soul, and make it all his own.Happy, the Clime, distinguish'd be the Age,When Genius shoots spontaneous for the Stage;Not too luxuriant, nor too trimly neat,But, in loose Wildness, negligently great.O may the gen'rous Plants, so wond'rous rare,Ne'er want the tender Hand of fost'ring care;But, like Apollo's fav'rite Tree, be seen,For ever flourishing, for ever green.McNAMARA MORGANPROLOGUESpoken by Mr. BARRY.OUR desp'rate Bard a bold Excursion tries,Tho' Danger damp'd his Wing, he dar'd to rise;From Hope, high rais'd, all glorious Actions spring;'Tis hence that Heroes conquer, Poets sing.Even he may feel the soul-exalting Fire,Fame prompts the humblest Bosom to aspire.Without a Guide this rash Attempt he made,Without a Clue from Art, or Learning's Aid.He takes a Theme where tend'rest Passions glow,A Theme, your Grandsires felt with pleasing Woe,ESSEX' sad Tale he strives to cloath anew,And hopes to place it in a stronger View.Poets, like Painters, may, by equal Law,The labour'd Piece from different Masters draw,Perhaps improve the Plan, add Fire and Grace,And strike th' impassion'd Soul through all the Face.How far our Author has secur'd a ClaimTo this exalted Palm, this wish'd-for Fame,Your generous Sentiments will soon declare:Humanity is ever prone to spare.'Twere Baseness then your Candour to distrust;A BRITISH Audience will, at least, be just.A flattering Truth he fearful must confess,His sanguine Friends made Promise of Success;But that, he fears, their ardent Wishes wrought,Since partial Favour seldom sees a Fault.Then bear, like patient Friends, this first Essay,His next shall thank you in a nobler Way.PERSONS.MEN.The Earl of ESSEX, Mr. BARRY.Earl of SOUTHAMPTON, Mr. SMITH.Lord BURLEIGH, Mr. SPARKES.Sir WALTER RALEIGH, Mr. USHER.Lieutenant of the Tower, Mr. BRANSBY.WOMEN.Queen ELIZABETH, Mrs. BLAND.Countess of RUTLAND, Mrs. CIBBER.Countess OF NOTTINGHAM, Mrs. VINCENT.Lords, Ladies, and Attendants.THE EARL OF ESSEX.ACT I.SCENE, an Antichamber in the Palace.Enter BURLEIGH and RALEIGH.BURLEIGH.THE Bill, at length, has pass'd opposing Numbers,Whilst Crowds seditious clamour'd round the senate,nd headlong Faction urg'd its Force within.RALEIGH. is, my Lord.—The wish'd-for Day is come,hn this proud Idol of the People's Heartsall now no more be worshipp'd.—Essex falls.y Lord, the Minute's near that shall unravele mystic Schemes of this aspiring Man.w Fortune, with officious Hand, invites us her, and opens wide the Gates of Greatness,

My Heart exults; I see,I see, my Lord, our utmost Wish accomplish'd!I see great Cecil shine without a Rival,And England bless him as her Guardian Saint.Such potent Instruments I have prepar'dAs shall, with speed, o'erturn this hated Man,And dash him down, by Proof invincible.BURLEIGH.His Day of Glory now is set in Night,And all my anxious Hopes, at last, are crown'd.Those Proofs against him, Raleigh—RALEIGH.All arriv'd.BURLEIGH.Arriv'd! how? when?RALEIGH.This very Hour, my Lord:Nay more, a Person comes, of high Distinction,To prove some secret Treaties made by Essex,With Scotland's Monarch, and the proud Tyrone.BURLEIGH.How say'st? to prove 'em?RALEIGH.Ay, my Lord, and back'dWith Circumstances of a stronger Nature.It now appears his Secretary Cuff,With Plunt and Lee were deep concern'd in thisDestructive Scheme, contriv'd to raise this Lord,And ruin Cecil, O it is a subtil,A deep-laid Mischief, by the Earl contriv'd,In Hour malignant, to o'erturn the State,And (Horror to conceive!) dethrone the Queen.BURLEIGH.These gladsome Tidings fly beyond my Hopes!The Queen will listen now, will now believe,And trust the Counsel of her faithful Burleigh.Let this most lucky Circumstance be kept
A Secret still from public Observation.—Dispose 'em well, till kind Occasion callTheir Office forth, lest prying Craft mean whileMay tamper with their Thoughts, and change their Minds:Let them, like Batteries conceal'd, appearAt once, both to surprize and to destroy.RALEIGH.This den Shock, my Lord, this weighty StrokeMust press him headlong down to deep Destruction:Indignant Fate marks out this dreaded Man,And Fortune now has left him.BURLEIGH.Thank the Changeling!His servile Faction soon will stand aghast,And sink, at distance, from his threat'ning Fall.RALEIGH.His head strong Friend, the bold Southampton too,Now finds his rash Endeavours all defeated;And storms at thee and the impeaching Commons.BURLEIGH.Let him rave on, and rage. — The Lion inThe Toils entangled, wastes his Strength, and roarsIn vain; his Efforts but amuse me now.—RALEIGH.What Triumphs in my Soul shall reign, to seeThis sanguine and o'erbearing Man brought downBeneath my Envy; nay, below my Scorn.How young Ambition swells my rising Hopes!Tis Heaven, O Cecil, calls, thro' England's Voice,And Justice, bending from above, invites us.Enter GENTLEMAN.GENTLEMAN.My Lord, the Lady Nottingham desiresWith much Impatience to attend your Lordship.BURLEIGH.What may the Purport of her Bus'ness be!Her tender Wishes are to Essex ty'dIn Love's soft Fetters, and endearing Bands:For him, each melting Thought awakes Desire,And all her Soul is lavish'd on that Lord.—This unexpected Visit much surprizes me!What can it mean? She would not come to pryAnd pick out Tales for Essex's Ear!—Why let her;I'm arm'd secure against her Arts and Cunning.Besides, her Errand comes too late; for nowHer Minion's doom'd to fall. — Conduct her in:Exit Gent.And you, my Raleigh, watch Southampton's Steps;With Care observe each Movement of his Friends;Let no Advantage on that Side be lost.Exit Ral.Southampton's Essex' second Self; he sharesHis headlong Councils, and adopts his Schemes;His daring Heart, and bold, ungovern'd Tongue,Are both enlisted in the rash DesignsOf this proud Lord, nor knows a Will but his.A Limb, so fix'd, must with the Body fall.Enter Lady NOTTINGHAM.NOTTINGHAM.Thrice hail to rescu'd England's guiding Genius'His Country's Guardian, and his Queen's Defence.Great Burleigh, thou whose Patriot Bosom beatsWith Albion's Glory, and Eliza's Fame;Who shield'st her Person, and support'st her Throne:For thee, what fervent Thanks, what offer'd Vows,Do prostrate Millions pay!BURLEIGH.Bright Excellence,This fair Applause too highly over-rates,To much extols the low Deserts of Cecil.NOTTINGHAM.What Praises are too high for Patriot-Worth;Or what Applause exceeds the Price of Virtue?My Lord, Conviction has at last subdu'd me,And I am Honour's Proselyte;—too longMy erring Heart pursu'd the Ways of Faction;Lown myself t' have been your bitt'rest Foe,And join'd with Essex in each soul AttemptTo blast your Honour, and traduce your Fame.BURLEIGH.Tho' ne'er my wishing Heart could call you Friend,Yet Honour and Esteem I always bore you;And never meant, but with Respect to serve you.It grieves me, Madam, to have thus offended,Where most my Wishes labour'd to oblige.NOTTINGHAM.I know your Honour and your Virtues well;Your public Plans, design'd for England's Good,And ad your private Merit's Weight.—But, Oh,How blind is Reason in the Maze of Passion!I sought your Ruin, labour'd for your Fall.But it Repentance may attone for Guilt,Or Self-reproach for sharpest Penance pass;No mortal Breast e'er felt more Woe than mine,And burleigh now may rank me for his Friend.BURLEIGH.That  a Worth of Soul should be abus'd Could accuse my Heart but of a Thought you Wrong? If any Purpose evergainst your Welfare in my Soul arose,That look'd with Malice on your shining Merit,Your matchless Beauty, or your brighter Virtues;Then let me live despis'd, a Proverb madeTo every passing Slave; nay more, the ScornAnd trampl'd Footstool of the Man I hate.NOTTINGHAM.It is enough, my Lord, I know it well,And feel rekindling Virtue warm my Breast;Honour and Gratitude their Force resumeWithin my Heart, and every Wish is your's.O Cecil, Cecil, what a Foe hast thou,A deadly Foe, whilst hated Essex lives.BURLEIGH.I know it well, but can assign no Cause.NOTTINGHAM.Ambition's restless Hand has wound his ThoughtsToo high for England's Welfare; nay, the QueenScarce sits in Safety on her Throne while he,Th' audacious Essex, freely treads at large,And breathes the common Air. Ambition isThe only God he serves, to whom he'd sacrificeHis Honour, Country, Friends, and every TyeOf Truth, and Bond of Nature; nay, his Love.BURLEIGH.I find this Bus'ness works as I would have it.AsideThe Man that in his public Duty fails,On private Virtues will disdainful tread,As Steps to raise him to some higher Purpose;In vain each softer Wish would plead with him,No tender Movement in his Soul prevails,And mighty Love, who rules all Nature else,Must follow here in proud Ambition's Train.NOTTINGHAM.Pronounce it not, my Soul abhors the Sound,Like Death. — O Cecil, will you kindly lendSome Pity to a Wretch like me!BURLEIGH.Command,Madam; my Power and Will are yours. I feelYour Wrongs, I feel the base Returns you've metFrom this ungrateful and disloyal Man,Tho' oft your Goodness screen'd him from Reproof;
Believe me worthy to partake your Grievance,Accept my Service, and employ my Power.NOTTINGHAM.Will Cecil's friendly Ear vouchsafe to bendIt's great Attention to a Woman's Wrongs,Whose Pride and Shame, Resentment and Despair,Rise up in raging Anarchy at once,To tear with ceaseless Pangs my tortur'd Soul?Words are unequal to the Woes I feel,And Language lessens what my Heart endures.Passion repuls'd with Scorn, and proud Disdain,Recoils indignant on my shrinking Soul,Beats back my vital Springs, and crushes Life.BURLEIGH.Madam your Wrongs, I must confess, are great;Yet still. I fear, you know not half his Falshood.Who, that had Eyes to look on Beauty? Who,That had a Heart to feel that Beauty's Power?Who, but the false, perfidious Essex, cou'dPrefer to Nottingham a Rutland's Charms?Start not. — By Heav'n I tell you nought but Truth,What I can prove, past doubt; that he receiv'dThe Lady Rutland's Hand, in sacred Wedlock,The very Night before his setting outFor Ireland.NOTTINGHAM.O may quick Destruction seize 'em!May Furies blast, and Hell destroy their Peace!May all their Nights —BURLEIGH.I pray have Patience, Madam,Restrain a while your Rage, Curses are vain.But there's a surer Method to destroy him;And if you'll join with me, 'tis done: he falls.NOTTINGHAM.Ha! say'st thou, Burleigh! speak, my Genius, speakBe quick as Vengeance' self to tell me how.BURLEIGH.You must have heard the Commons have impeach'd himAnd we have Proofs sufficient for his Ruin.But then the Queen — you know how fair he standsIn her Esteem; and Rutland too, his Wife,Hath full Possession of the Royal Ear.What then avail Impeachments or the Law'sSeverest Condemnation, while the QueenMay snatch him from th' uplifted Hand of Justice.Here then, my Nottingham, begins thy Task.Try ev'ry Art t' incense the Queen against him,Then step between her and the Lady Rutland▪Let not her Fondness find the least AccessTo the Queen's Heart to counterwork our Purpose.Observe Southampton too, with jealous Eye;Prevent, as much as possible his Suit:For well I know he will not fail to tryHis Eloquence on the Behalf of Essex.NOTTINGHAM.It shall be done; his Doom is fix'd; he dies.O 'twas a precious Thought! I never knewSuch Heart-felt Satisfaction!—Essex dies,And Rutland, in her Turn, shall learn to weep.The Time is precious; I'll about it streight.Come Vengeance, come, assist me now to breatheThy venom'd Spirit in the Royal Ear.Exit NottinghamBURLEIGH.There spoke the very Genius of the Sex.A disappointed Woman sets no BoundsTo her Revenge. Her Temper's form'd to serve Enter RALEIGH.RALEIGH.The Lord Southampton with ungovern'd Rage,Resents aloud his disappointed Measures:I met him in the outward Court; he seeksIn haste your Lordship, and forgetting Forms,Pursues me hither, and demands to see you.BURLEIGH.Raleigh, 'tis well—Withdraw—Attend the Queen;Leave me to deal with this o'erbearing Man.Ex. Ral.Enter SOUTHAMPTON.SOUTHAMPTON.Where is the Man, whom Virtue calls her Friend?I give you Joy, my Lord! — Your quenchless FuryAt length prevails, —and now your Malice triumphs:You've hunted Honour to the Toil of Faction,And view his Struggles with malicious Joy.BURLEIGH.What means my Lord?SOUTHAMPTON.O Fraud! shall valiant EssexBe made a Sacrifice to your Ambition?Oh it smells foul indeed, of rankest MaliceAnd the vile Statesman's Craft.—You dare not sureThus bid Defiance to each Shew of Worth,Each Claim of Honour: dare not injure thusYour suffering Country in her bravest Son?BURLEIGH.ut why should stern Reproach her angry Browet fall on me? Am I alone the CauseThat gives this working Humour Strength? Do Istruct the public Voice to warp his Actions?
Justice untaught, shall poize th' impartial Scales,And every curious Eye may mark the Beam.SOUTHAMPTON.The specious Shield which private Malice bears,Is ever blazon'd with some public Good;Behind that artful Fence, sculk low, conceal'd,The bloody Purpose, and the poison'd Shaft;Ambition there, and Envy, nestle close;From thence, they take their fatal Aim unseen;And honest Merit is the destin'd Mark.BURLEIGH.Your warm distemper'd zeal puts rashly byThe cool directing Hand of wholesome Reason.No Imputation oul shall rest on me;My honest Purposes defy aloudThe slander-spreading Tongue of busy Faction,To cast its Venom on my fair Report,Or tell Posterity, Thus Cecil did.My Country's Welfare, and my Queen's CommaHave ever been my guiding Stars thro' Life,My sure Direction still. — To these I nowAppeal; — from these no doubt this Lord's MiscondHath widely stray'd, and Reason, not reviling,Must now befriend his Cause.SOUTHAMPTON.How ill had ProvidenceDispos'd the suffering World's opprest Affairs,Had sacred Right's eternal Rule, been leftTo crafty Politicians' partial Sway?Then Power and Pride wou'd stretch th' enormous And call their arbitrary Portion, Justice:Ambition's Arm, by Av'rice urg'd, wou'd pluckThe Core of Honesty from Virtue's Heart,And plant Deceit, and Rancour in its Stead:Falshood wou'd trample then on Truth and HonoAnd Envy poison sweet Benevolence.
Oh, 'tis a goodly Groupe of Attributes,And well befits some Statesmen's righteous Rule!Out, out upon such base and bloody Doings!The Term of Being is not worth the Sin;No human Bosom can endure its Dart.Then put this cruel Purpose from thee far,Nor let the Blood of Essex whelm thy Soul.BURLEIGHTis well, my Lord! your Words no Comment need;No doubt, they've well explain'd your honest Meaning:Tis clear and full. — To Parts, like yours, DiscretionWou'd be a Clog, and Caution but Incumbrance.Yet mark me well, my Lord, the clinging IvyWith th' Oak may rife, but with it too must fall.SOUTHAMPTON.Thy empty Threats, ambitious Man, hurt notThe Breast of Truth. Fair Innocence, and Faith,Those Strangers to thy practis'd Heart, shall shieldMy Honour, and preserve my Friend.—In vain,Thy Malice, with unequal Arm, shall striveTo tear th' applauded Wreath from Essex' Brow;His honest Laurei, held alost by Fame,Above thy blasting reach, shall safely flourish,And bloom immortal to the latest Times:Whilst thou, amidst thy tangling Snares involv'd,Shalt sink confounded, and unpitied fall.BURLEIGH.Rail on, proud Lord, and give thy Choler vent:It wastes itself in vain; the Queen shall judgeBetween us in this warm Debate. To herI now repair, and in her royal PresenceYou may approve your Innocence and Faith.Perhaps you'll meet me there. — Till then, farewel.Exit.SOUTHAMPTON.Confusion wait thy Steps, thou cruel Monster:
My noble and illustrious Friend betray'd,By crafty Faction and tyrannic Power!His sinking Trophies, and his falling Fame,Oppress my very Soul. I'll to the Queen,Lay all their Envy open to her View,Confront their Malice and preserve my Friend.Exit.The QUEEN discovered sitting on her Throne.RALEIGH, Lords, and Attendants.QUEEN.Without consulting me! presumptuous Man!Who governs here? — What! am not I your QueenYou dar'd not, were he present, take this Step.RALEIGH.Dread Sovereign, your ever faithful CommonsHave, in their Gratitude, and Love for you,Preferr'd this salutary Bill against him.Enter BURLEIGH.QUEEN.You, my Lord Burleigh, must have known of this.The Commons here impeach the Earl of EssexOf practicing against the State and me.Methinks I might be trusted with the Secret.Speak, for I know it well, 'twas thy Contrivance.Ha! was it not? You dare not say it was not.BURLEIGH.I own my Judgment did concur with theirs.His Crimes, I fear, will justify the Charge,And vindicate their Loyalty and mine.QUEEN.Ha! tell not me your smooth, deceitful Story!I know your Projects, and your close Cabals.
You'd turn my Favour into Party Feuds,And use my Scepter as the Rod of Faction:But Henry's Daughter claims a nobler Soul.I'll nurse no party, but will reign o'er all,And my sole Rule shall be to bless my People:Who serves them best has still my highest Favour;This Essex ever did.Enter SOUTHAMPTON.Behold, Southampton,What a base Portrait's here! The faithful EssexHere drawn at large, associating with RebelsTo spoil his Country, and dethrone his Queen.SOUTHAMPTON.It is not like. — By Heav'n the Hand of EnvyDrew these false Lines, distorted far from TruthAnd Honour, and unlike my noble FriendAs Light to Shade, or Hell to highest Heav'n.Then suffer not, thou best of Queens, this Lord,This valiant Lord, to fall a SacrificeTo Treachery and base Designs; who nowEngages Death in all his horrid Shapes,Amidst a hardy race inur'd to Danger:But let him, face to face, this Charge encounter,And every Falshood, like his Foes, shall fly.QUEEN.To me you seem to recommend strict Justice,In all her Pomp of Power. But are you sureNo subtil Vice conceal'd assumes her Garb?Take heed, that Malice does not wear the Mask,Nor Envy deck her in the borrow'd Guise.Rancour has often darken'd Reason's Eye,And Judgment winks, when Passion holds the Scale.mpeach the very Man to whom I oweMy brightest Rays of Glory! Look to it, Lords,
Take care, be cautious on what Ground you tread;Let honest Means alone secure your Footing.Raleigh and you withdraw, and wait our Leisure.Exeunt Ral. and South.Lord Burleigh, stay; we must with you have fartherConf'rence.—I see this base Contrivance plain.Your Jealousy and Pride, your Envy ofHis shining Merit, brought this Bill to Light.But mark me, as you prize our high regard,And Favour, I command you to suppress it:Let not our Name and Power be embarrass'dIn your perplexing Schemes. 'Twas you began,And therefore you must end it.BURLEIGH.I obey.Yet humbly would intreat you to considerHow new, unpopular, this Step must be,To stand between your Parliament's EnquiryAnd this offending Lord.—We have such Proofs—QUEEN.Reserve your Proofs to a more proper Season,And let them then appear. But once againWe charge you on your Duty and Allegiance,To stop this vile Proceeding; and to waitTill Essex can defend himself in Person.If then your Accusations are of Force,The Laws, and my Consent, no doubt, are open.He has my strict Command, with Menace mix'd,To end effectually this hated War,Ere he presume to quit the Irish Coast.BURLEIGH.Madam my Duty now compels me to—QUEEN.No more! see that my Orders be obey'd.Exit Bur.Essex a Traytor! — it can never be —His grateful and his honest Soul disdains it. —
I know him hot, ambitious, rash, impatient;But then he's firmly anchor'd in his Duty:Tho' stormy passions toss him to and fro.Can he prove false? so high advanc'd, so honour'd,So near my Favour—and—I fear, so nearMy Heart!—Impossible.—This Burleigh hates him,And, as his Rival, therefore would destroy him:But he shall find his narrow Schemes defeated.In vain their fraudful Efforts shall combine,To shake my settled Soul, my firm Design;Resolv'd to lift bright Virtue's Palm on high,Support her Grandeur, and her Foes defy.Exit.ACT II.Enter BURLEIGH and RALEIGH.BURLEIGH.ESSEX arriv'd! Confusion to my Hopes!His Presence will destroy me with the Queen.I much suspect he had some private Notice,Perhaps, a punctual Order to return.He lurks too near her Heart.—What's to be done?Prepare the Witnesses with Speed; apprizeThe Lady Nottingham.—Southampton's Pride,And Rutland's too, will lift the Crest again.But fly, my Raleigh, send me Nottingham.Exit RalWe must alarm the Queen with new CommotionsIn many Parts of her Dominions rais'd:All this, and more, must now be pass'd for Truth.This sudden Blow has struck me to the Soul;'Tis gone too far, he dies—proud Essex now,Or Cecil falls. Now is th' important Crisis—Keep up thy usual Strength; my better Genius,Direct my Steps to crush my mortal Foe.Enter QUEEN and RALEIGH.QUEEN.It cannot be!—Return'd without my Leave!Against my strict Command!—Impossible!RALEIGH.Madam, the Earl is now at Court, and begsAn Audience of your Majesty.QUEEN.Amazing!What! break his Trust! desert his high Command!Forsake his Post, and disobey his Queen!'Tis false—invented all.—You wish it so.BURLEIGH.Madam, I wish some other Rumours false.Reports, I fear, of great Concern to you.QUEEN.What Rumours, what Reports? Your Frown wou'd muchDenote: your Preface seems important—Speak.BURLEIGH.Some new Commotions are of late sprung upIn Ireland, where the West is all in Arms,And moves with hasty March to join Tyrone,And all his Northern Clans. A dreadful Power!Nay more, we have Advices from the BordersOf sudden Risings, near the Banks of Tweed!'Tis thought, to favour an Attempt from Scotland.Mean while, Tyrone embarks six thousand MenTo land at Milford, and to march where EssexShall join them with his Friends.QUEEN.In League with James!And plotting with Tyrone! It cannot be.His very Pride disdains such Perfidy.But is not Essex here without my Leave!Against my strict Command! that, that's Rebellion.The rest, if true, or false, it matters not.What's to be done?—admit him to my Presence?No, no—my Dignity, my Pride forbid it.Ungrateful Man, approach me not; rise, riseResentment, and support my Soul! Disdain,Do thou assist me.—Yes, it shall be so.BURLEIGH.I see she muses deep; her Mind works upwards,And paints it's struggling Efforts in her Face.Tyrone's Invasion wakes her Fear and Anger,And all her Soul is one continued Storm.QUEEN.For once my Pride shall stoop; and I will seeThis rash, audacious, this once favour'd Man;But treat him as his daring Crimes deserve.Enter SOUTHAMPTON.SOUTHAMPTON kneeling.Permit me, Madam, to approach you thus;Thus lowly to present the humble SuitOf the much injur'd, faithful, Earl of Essex:Who dares not, unpermitted, meet your Presence.He begs, most gracious Queen, to fall beforeYour royal Feet, to clear him to his Sovereign,Whom, next to Heav'n, he wishes most to please.Let Faction load him with her labouring Hand,His Innocence shall rise against the Weight,If but his gracious Mistress deign to smile.QUEEN.Let him appear.Exit SouthNow to thy trying Task,My Soul! put forth, exert thy utmost Strength,Nor let an injur'd Queen be tame. — Lye still,My Heart! I cannot listen to thee now.Enter ESSEX and SOUTHAMPTON.ESSEX.Forgive, thou, injur'd Majesty, thou bestOf Queens, this seeming Disobedience. See,I bend submissive in your royal Presence,With Soul as penitent, as if beforeTh' all-searching Eye of Heav'n. But, Oh, that FrownMy Queen's Resentment wounds my inmost Spirit,Strikes me like Death, and pierces thro' my Heart.QUEEN.You have obey'd, my Lord! you've serv'd me well!My deadly Foes are quell'd! and you come homeA Conqueror! your Country bids you welcome!And I, your Queen, applaud!—Triumphant Man!What! is it thus that Essex gains his Laurels?And is it thus you've borne my high Commission?How durst you disregard your trusted Duty,Desert your Province, and betray your Queen?ESSEX.I came to clear my injur'd Name from Guilt,Imputed Guilt, and slanderous Accusations.My Shame was wafted in each passing Gale,Each swelling Tide came loaded with my Wrongs;And Echo sounded forth, from Faction's Voice,The Traytor Essex.—Was't not hard, my Queen,That whilst I stood in Danger's dreadful Front,Encountering Death in every shape of Terror,And bleeding for my Country?—Was't not hard,My mortal Enemies at home, like Cowards,Shou'd in my Absence basely blast my Fame?QUEEN.It is the Godlike Attribute of KingsTo raise the Virtuous, and protect the Brave.I was the Guardian of your Reputation,What Malice, or what Faction then cou'd reach you?My Honour was expos'd, engag'd for your's:But you found Reason to dislike my Care,And to yourself assum'd the wrested Office.ESSEX.If aught disloyal in this Bosom dwells,If aught of Treason lodges in this Heart,May I to Guilt and lasting Shame be wedded,The Sport of Faction, and the Mark of Scorn;The World's Derision, and my Queen's Abhorrence.Stand forth the Villain, whose invenom'd TongueWould taint my Honour, and traduce my Name,
Or stamp my Conduct with a Rebel's Brand!Lives there a Monster in the Haunts of MenDares tear my Trophies from their pillar'd Base,Eclipse my Glory and disgrace my Deeds?QUEEN.This ardent Language, and this glow of Soul,Were nobly graceful in a better Cause;Where Virtue warrants, and where Truth inspires.But injur'd Truth with Brow invincibleFrowns stern Reproof upon the false Assertion,And contradicts it with the Force of Facts.From me you have appeal'd, ungrateful Man;The Laws, not I, must listen to your Plea.Go stand the Test severe, abide the Tryal,And mourn too late the Bounty you abus'dExit Queen, Southampton, &c.ESSEX.Is this the just Requital, then, of allMy Patriot-Toils and oft-encounter'd Perils,Amidst th' Inclemencies of Camps and Climes?Then be it so.—Unmov'd and dauntless, let meThis Shock of adverse Fortune firmly stand.But yet, methinks, 'tis somewhat sudden too.My Greatness, now depriv'd of each Support,Which bore so long its envy'd Weight aloft,Must quick to ruin fall, and crush my Hopes.Enter SOUTHAMPTON.SOUTHAMPTON.Alas, my Lord, the Queen's Displeasure kindlesWith Warmth increasing, whilst Lord Burleigh laboursT' inflame her Wrath, and make it still burn fiercer.ESSEX.I scorn the Blaze of Courts, the Pomp of Kings;I give them to the Winds and lighter Vanity:Too long they've robb'd me of substantial Bliss,
Of solid Happiness, and true Enjoyment.But lead me to my mourning Love, alas!She sinks beneath oppressing Ills, she fades,She dies for my afflicting Pangs, and seeksMe sorrowing in the Walks of Woe. — Distraction!O lead me to her, to my Soul's Desire.SOUTHAMPTON.Let Caution guide you in this dangerous Step.Consider well, my Lord, the Consequence—For should the Queen (forbid it Heaven!) discoverYour private Loves, your plighted Hands, no PowerOn Earth could step between you and Destruction.Lock up this Secret from the prying World.Enter BURLEIGH.BURLEIGH.My Lord of Essex, 'tis the Queen's CommandThat you forthwith resign your Staff of Office;And, further, she confines you to your Palace.ESSEX.Welcome, my Fate; let Fortune do her utmost;I know the worst, and will confront her Malice,And bravely bear the unexpected Blow.BURLEIGH.The Queen, my Lord, demands your quick Compliance.ESSEX.Go then, thou gladsome Messenger of Ill,And, joyful, feast thy fierce rapacious SoulWith Essex' sudden and accomplish'd Fall.The trampled Coarse of all his envy'd Greatness,Lies prostrate now, beneath thy savage Feet;But still th' exalted Spirit mounts above thee.Go, tell the Queen thy own detested Story;Full in her Sight disclose the snaky Labyrinths,And lurking Snares you plant in Virtue's Path,To catch Integrity's unguarded Step.BURLEIGH.How ill repaid are public Toils and Cares,Where active Honesty with Station join'd,Incurs but Calumny, and foul Reproach!Your Country has impeach'd, your Queen accus'd you;To these address your best Defence, and clearYour question'd Conduct from disloyal Guilt.What Answer to the Queen shall I return?ESSEX.My Staff of Office I from her receiv'd,And will to her, and her alone, resign it.BURLEIGH.This bold Refusal will incense the Queen;This Arrogance will make your Guilt the stronger.Exit.SOUTHAMPTON.Sustain, my noble Friend, thy wonted Greatness;Collect thy Fortitude, and summon allThy Soul, to bear with Strength this crushing Weight,Which falls severe upon thee; whilst my FriendshipShall lend a helping Hand, and share the Burthen.I'll hence with Speed, and to the Queen repair,And all the Power of warmest Words employTo gain you yet one Audience more, and bringHer Majesty to milder Thoughts, Farewel.Exit.ESSEX.As newly wak'd from all my Dreams of Glory,Those gilded Visions of deceitful Joys,I stand confounded at th' unlook'd-for Change,And scarcely feel this Thunder-bolt of Fate.The painted Clouds, which bore my Hopes aloft,Alas, are vanish'd now to yielding Air,And I am fallen indeed!—How weak is Reason, when Affection pleads?How hard to turn the fond deluded HeartFrom flatt'ring Toys, which sooth'd it's Vanity?The laurell'd Trophy and the loud Applause,
The Victor's Triumph, and the People's Gaze,The high-hung Banner, and recording Gold,Subdue me still, still cling around my Heart,And pull my Reason down.Enter RUTLAND.RUTLAND.O let me flyTo clasp, embrace, the Lord of my Desires!My Soul's Delight, my utmost Joy, my Husband!I feel once more his panting Bosom beat,Once more I hold him in my eager Arms,Behold his Face, and lose my Soul in Rapture.ESSEX.Transporting Bliss! my richest, dearest Treasure!My mourning Turtle! my long absent Peace!O come yet nearer, nearer to my Heart!My raptur'd Soul springs forward to receive thee:Thou Heav'n on Earth, thou Balm of all my Woe!RUTLAND.O shall I credit then each ravish'd Sense?Has pitying Heaven consented to my Prayer?It has, it has, my Essex is return'd!But Language poorly speaks the Joys I feel;Let Passion paint, and Looks express my Soul.ESSEX.With thee, my sweetest Comfort, I'll retireFrom splendid Palaces, and glittering Throngs,To live embosom'd in the Shades of Joy;Where sweet Content extends her friendly Arms,And gives increasing Love a lasting Welcome.With thee I'll timely fly from proud Oppression,Forget our Sorrows, and be bless'd for ever.RUTLAND.O let us hence, beyond the Reach of Power;Where Fortune's Hand shall never part us more.
In this calm State of Innocence and Joy,I'll press thee to my throbbing Bosom close.Ambition's Voice shall call in vain; the World,The thankless World, shall never claim thee more,And all thy Bus'ness shall be Love and me.ESSEX.The Queen, incens'd at my Return, abandons meTo Cecil's Malice, and the Rage of Faction.I'm now no more the favourite Child of Fortune:My Enemies have caught me in the Toil,And Life has nothing worth my Wish but thee.RUTLAND.Delusive Dream of fancy'd Happiness!And has my fatal Fondness then destroy'd thee!Oh! have I lur'd thee to the deadly SnareThy cruel Foes have laid? Oh! have I putThy Life in Peril? My officious TearsWould needs inform thee of their wicked Schemes,I dreaded Cecil's Malice, and my Heart,Longing to see thee with Impatience, listen'dTo it's own Alarms; and Prudence sunk beneathThe Force of Love.ESSEX.Forbear, my only Comfort;O tell me not of Danger, Death, and Eurleigh,Let every Star shed down it's mortal BaneOn my unshelter'd Head: Whilst thus I foldThee in my raptur'd Arms; I'll brave 'em all,Defy my Fate, and meet it's utmost Rigour.RUTLAND.Alas! my Lord, consider where we are.Oh! 'tis the Queen's Apartment; Death is here:I came to thee through Peril's ambush'd Path,And every Danger risqu'd for thy Embrace.Each precious Moment is by Fate beset,And Time stands trembling whilst we thus confer.ESSEX.Then let us hence from this detested Place;My rescu'd Soul disdains the House of Greatness,Where humble Honesty can find no Shelter.From hence we'll fly, where Love and Virtue call,Where Happiness invites,—that Wish of all;With sweet Content enjoy each blissful Hour,Beyond the Smiles of Fraud, or Frowns of Power.ACT III.Enter BURLEIGH and NOTTINGHAM.NOTTINGHAM.MY Lord, I've sought you out with much Impatience.You've had an Audience of the Queen; what follow'd?BURLEIGH.Soon as I told her Essex had refus'dTo yield his Dignities, and Staff of Office,Against her high Command, pronounc'd by me,She seem'd depriv'd of Reason for a Moment;Her working Mind betray'd contending Passions,Which, in her alter'd Face, appear'd by Turns.She paus'd, like Thunder in some kindling Cloud,Then instant burst with dreadful Fury forth:And has th' ungrateful Wretch defy'd my Mandate?The proud, audacious Traytor scorn'd my Power?He dares not sure.—He dies—the Villain dies!Then, sudden, soften'd into milder Sounds,And call'd him rash, unhappy, gallant Essex!On me her Fury fell, my crafty PlansAgainst his Reputation, Fam cand Life,Had driv'n him to Extremes—my Malice did it,My Envy was his Bane; with all that PassionOr Fury cou'd suggest.—I beg'd to knowHer Royal Will concerning Essex, urg'dAgain his Insolence.—Amaz'd a whileShe stood, and wist not what to do.—At lengthCollecting all her Mind▪ these Words she utter'd;—Let him to the Tow'r—I instantly withdrew,
But soon was countermanded, and desir'dTo bring the Earl of Essex to her Presence.I like it not, and much I sear she'll standBetween this high Offender and the Laws.NOTTINGHAM.Is Essex then secur'd?BURLEIGH.Madam, he is;And now comes guarded to the Court.Enter GENTLEMAN.GENTLEMAN.Madam, the QueenIs in her Closet, and desires to see you.Exit.NOTTINGHAM.I attend her.BURLEIGH.She wants, no doubt, to be advis'd by you.Improve this fair Occasion, urge it home.She mast be quicken'd by repeated StrokesOf fresh indignities, by Essex offer'dT' her Royal Person, and Prerogative.Be circumspect and cautious! mark her well.NOTTINGHAM.I know her Foible. Essex long has hadAn Interest in her Heart, which nothing canO'erturn, except his own ungovern'd Spirit.It is, indeed, the Instrument, by whichWe work, and cannot fail, if rightly us'd.BURLEIGH.Madam, the Queen expects you instantly.I must withdraw, and wait the Earl's Arrival.Exeunt.
QUEEN Discovered.QUEEN.Ill-fated, wretched Man! perverse and obstinate!He counterworks my Grace, and courts Destruction.He gives his deadly Foes the Dagger toDestroy him, and defeats my friendly Purpose,Which would, by seeming to abandon, save him.Nor will he keep the Mask of Prudence onA Moment's space.—What! must I bear this Scorn?No. Let me all the Monarch reassume!Exert my Power, and be myself again!—O ill performing disobedient Heart!—Why shrink'st thou fearful from thy own Resolve?Enter NOTTINGHAM.Thou com'st in time, I'm much disturb'd, abus'd,My Nottingham, and wou'd complain to thee,Of Insolence, Neglect, and high Contempt.Essex presum'd to dictate Laws withinMy Palace Gates. How say'st thou, Nottingham?NOTTINGHAM.Surely, my gracious Queen, it cannot be!His Heat and Passion never cou'd impel himTo take so bold a Step, to such rash Guilt:Methinks his very Honour shou'd prevent it.QUEEN.Thy open honest Mind untutor'd seemsIn Life's ungrateful and degenerate School;Where stubborn Vice in every Form appears,Mocking Correction's ineffectual Rod.It is, indeed, an Evil hard to bear,
This haughty Man has wanton'd with my Grace,Abus'd my Bounty, and despis'd my Favours.That giving Goodness shou'd profusely flowT'enrich the surly Glebe, where only ThornsAnd noxious Weeds will spring!Resentment, then, shall in her turn prevail;To angry Laws I'll give this Victim up.NOTTINGHAM.His Conduct has, I fear, been too unguarded;His hasty Temper knows not where to stop.Ambition is the Spur of all his Actions,Which often drives him o'er his Duty's Limit.(At least his Enemies would have it so)But Malice, Madam, seldom judges right.QUEEN.O Nottingham, his Pride is past enduring;This insolent, audacious Man forgetsHis Honour and Allegiance.—And refus'dTo render up his Staff of Office here,Beneath my very Eye.NOTTINGHAM.Presumptuous Man!Your faithful Subjects will resent this Pride,This Insolence, this Treason to their Queen;They must, my gracious Sovereign.—'Tis not safeTo shield him longer from their just Resentment.Then give him up to Justice and the Laws.QUEEN.You seem well pleas'd to urge Severity.—Offended Majesty but seldom wantsSuch sharp Advisers.—Yet no AttributeSo well befits th' exalted Seat supreme,And Power's disposing Hand, as Clemency.Each Crime must from its quality be judg'd;And pity there shou'd interpose, where maliceIs not th' Aggressor! Hence, I'll hear no more.NOTTINGHAM.Madam, my Sentiments were well intended;Justice, not Malice, mov'd my honest Zeal.My Words were Echo's of the public Voice,Which daily rises with repeated CriesOf high Complaint, against this haughty Lord.I pity from my Heart, his rash Attempts,And much esteem the Man.QUEEN.Go, Nottingham,My Mind's disturb'd, and send me Rutland hitherExit Not.O vain Distinction of exalted State!No Rank ascends above the reach of Care,Nor Dignity can shield a Queen from Woe.Despotic Nature's stronger Scepter rules,And Pain and Passion in her Right prevail.O the unpity'd Lot, severe Condition,Of Solitary, sad dejected Grandeur!Alone condemn'd to bear th' unsocial ThrobOf heart-felt Anguish, and corroding Grief;Depriv'd of what, within his homely Shed,The poorest Peasant in Affiction finds,The kind condoling Comfort of a dearPartaking Friend.—Enter Countess of RUTLAND.Rutland, I want thy timelyCounsel. I'm importun'd, and urg'd to punish—But Justice, sometimes, has a cruel Sound,Where Mercy may with Prudence meet, and bothAgree to soften Rigour.—Essex has,No doubt, provok'd my Anger, and the Laws;His haughty Conduct calls for sharp Reproof,And just Correction. Yet I think him guiltless
Of studied Treasons, or design'd Rebellion.Then tell me, Rutland, what the World reports,What Censure says of his unruly Deeds.RUTLAND.The World with Envy's Eye beholds his Merit.Madam, 'tis Malice all, and false Report.I know his noble Heart, 'tis fill'd with Honour.No trait'rous Taint has touch'd his generous Soul;His grateful Mind still glows with pure Affection;And all his Thoughts are Loyalty and you.QUEEN.I grant you, Rutlana, all you say, and thinkThe Earl possess'd of many splendid Virtues.What Pity 'tis, he shou'd afford his FoesSuch frequent sad Occasions to undo him.RUTLAND.What human Heart can unafflicted bearSuch manly Merit in Distress; such WorthBetray'd; such Valour in the Toil, besetBy cruel Foes, and Faction's savage Cry?My good, my gracious Mistress, stretch betimesYour saving Arm, and snatch him from Destruction;From deadly Malice, Treachery, and Cecil!O let him live to clear his Conduct up!My gracious Queen, he'll nobly earn your Bounty,And with his dearest Blood deserve your Mercy.QUEEN.Her Words betray a warm unusual Fervour!Me e Friendship never could inspire this Transport.Aside.I never doubted but the Earl was brave;His Life and valiant Actions, all declare it:I think him honest too, but rash and headstrong.I gladly wou'd preserve him from his Foes!And therefore am resolv'd once more to see him.RUTLAND.Oh, 'tis a godlike Thought, and Heaven itselfInspires it, Sure some Angel moves your Heart,Your royal Heart, to Pity and Forgiveness.This gracious Deed shall shine in future Story,And deck your Annals with the brightest Virtue;Posterity shall praise the princely Act,And Ages yet to come record your Goodness.QUEEN.I'll hear no more.—Must I then learn from youTo know my Province, and be taught to move,As each designing Mind directs.—Leave me.RUTLAND.Her Frowns are dreadful, and her Eye looks Terror.I tremble for my Essex! Save him, Heaven!Exit.QUEEN.Her Warmth has touch'd me home. My jealous HeartMy fearful and suspicious Soul's alarm'd.Enter BURLEIGH, RALEIGH, and others.BURLEIGH.The Earl of Essex waits your Royal Will.QUEEN.Let him approach.—And now, once more, supportThy Dignity, my Soul; nor yield thy GreatnessTo strong usurping Passion.—But he comes.Enter ESSEX, SOUTHAMPTON, Guards.ESSEX.Permitted thus to bend, with prostrate Heart,kneels.Before your sacred Majesty; I comeWith every grateful Sense of royal Favour,Deeply engrav'd within my conscious Soul.QUEEN.I sent my Orders for your Staff of Office.ESSEX.Madam, my envy'd Dignities and HonoursI first from your own royal Hand receiv'd;And therefore justly held it far beneath meTo yield my Trophies, and exalted Power,So dearly purchas'd in the Field of Glory,To Hands unworthy. No, my gracious Queen,I meant to lay them at your royal Feet;Where Life itself a willing Victim falls,If you command.QUEEN.High swelling Words, my Lord, but ill supplyThe Place of Deeds, and Duty's just Demand.In Danger's Onset, and the Day of Tryal,Conviction still on acting Worth attends;Whilst mere Professions are by Doubts encumber'd.ESSEX.My Deeds have oft declar'd, in Danger's Front,How far my Duty and my Valour lead me.Allegiance still my Thirst of Glory sir'd,And all my bravely-gather'd, envy'd Laurels,Were purchas'd only to adorn my Queen.QUEEN.Yet Fact o'er Fallacy must still prevail,And Eloquence to simple Truth give Way.Your guilty Scorn of my entrusted Power,When with my mortal Foes you tamely dally'd,By hardy Rebels brav'd, you poorly soughtA servile Pause, and begg'd a shameful Truce.Should Essex thus, so meanly compromise,And lose the Harvest of a plenteous Glory,In idle Treaties, and suspicious Parly?ESSEX.O deadly Stroke! My Life's the destin'd Mark.The poison'd Shaft has drunk my Spirits deep.Is't come to this? Conspire with Rebels! Hah!I've serv'd you, Madam, with the utmost Peril,And ever glory'd in th' illustrious Danger;Where Famine fac'd me with her meagre Mein,And Pestilence, and Death brought up her Train.I've fought your Battles, in Despite of Nature,Where Seasons sicken'd, and the Clime was Fate.My Power to parly, or to fight, I hadFrom you; the Time and Circumstance did callAloud for mutual Treaty and Conditions;For that I stand a guarded Felon here.—A Traitor,Hem'd in by Villains, and by Slaves surrounded.QUEEN.Shall added Insolence, with Crest audacious,Her Front uplift against the Face of Power?Think not that injur'd Majesty will bearSuch Arrogance uncheck'd, or unchastiz'd.No public Trust becomes the Man who treadsWith scornful Steps in Honour's sacred Path,And stands at bold Defiance with his Duty.ESSEX.Away with Dignities and hated Trust,With flattering Honours, and deceitful Power!Invert th' eternal Rules of Right and Justice;Let Villains thrive, and out-cast Virtue perish!Let Slaves be rais'd, and Cowards have Command!Take, take your gaudy Trifles back, those BaitsOf Vice, and Virtue's Bane.—'Tis clear, my Queen,My royal Mistress casts me off; nay, joinsWith Cecil to destroy my Life, and Fame.QUEEN.Presuming Wretch! Audacious Traytor!ESSEX.Traytor!QUEEN.Hence from my Sighr, ungrateful Slave, and learnAt distance to revere your Queen.ESSEX.Yes; letMe fly beyond the Limits of the World,And Nature's Verge, from proud Oppression far,From Malice, Tyranny, from Courts, from you.QUEEN.Traytor, Villain!Strikes him.ESSEX.Confusion! what, a Blow!RestraingoodHeaven! down, down, thou Rebel Passion,And Judgment take the Reins. Madam, 'tis well—Your Soldier falls degraded.His Glory's tarnish'd, and his Fame undone.O bounteous Recompence from royal Hands!But you, ye Implements, beware, beware,What Honour wrong'd and honest Wrath can act.QUEEN.What would th' imperious Traytor do! My LifeBeyond thy wretched Purpose stands secure.Go, learn at leisure what your Deeds deserve,And tremble at the Vengeance you provoke.Exeunt Queen, Burleigh, Raleigh, &c. manent Southampton and Essex.ESSEX.Disgrac'd and struck! Damnation! Death were gloriousRevenge! Revenge!SOUTHAMPTON.Alas, my Friend, what wouldThy Rage attempt? Consider well the greatAdvantage now your rash, ungovern'd TemperAffords your Foes. The Queen incens'd will letTheir Fury loose.—I dread the dire Event.ESSEX.Has honest Pride no just Resentment left!Nor injur'd Honour feeling! Not Revenge!High Heaven shall hear, and Earth regret my Wrongs.Hot Indignation burns within my Soul!I'll do some dreadful Thing,—(I know not what!Some Deed as horrid, as the Shame I feel)Shall startle Nature, and alarm the World;Then hence, like Lightning, let me furious flyTo hurl Destruction at my Foes on high;Pull down Oppression from its Tyrant Seat,Redeem my Glory, or embrace my Fate.Exeunt.ACT IV.Enter QUEEN, NOTTINGHAM.QUEEN.NOT taken yet!NOTTINGHAM.No, Madam, for the EarlOf Essex leagu'd with desperate Friends, made strongAnd obstinate Resistance; till at lengthO'erpower'd by Numbers and encreasing Force,He sled for Shelter to a small Retreat,A Summer-house upon the Thames; resolv'dTo perish rather than submit to Power.QUEEN.O Wretch detested! O unheard-of Treason!Conspire against my Life, within my View!My Reach! so near my very Palace Gates!Persidious Monster!—What can Prudence do,Or human Wisdom more than judge from Outside,And flattering Likeness? Kings can see no farther.High Heaven, alone, can read the Heart, in allIts utmost Frauds, and mystic Characters.O where shall Majesty bestow its Favours,Since Essex has a Traitor prov'd to me,Whose Arm hath rais'd him up to Power and Greatness,Whose Heart hath shar'd in all his splendid Triumphs,And feels ev'n now his trait'rous Deeds with Pity?
But hence with Pity and the Woman's Pangs;Resentment governs, and the Queen shall punish.Enter BURLEIGH.BURLEIGH.Illustrious Queen, the Traitors all are seiz'd.Th' Intelligence was true. Their black DebatesWere held at Drury-house. The dire ResultWas this; that Essex shou'd alarm the CitizensTo open Mutiny, and bold Rebellion;On this pernicious Errand went the Earl,Join'd by his desp'rate and seditious Friends.Their Purpose was to seize your Royal Palace,And sacred Person; but your faithful People,As by one Mind inform'd, one Zeal inspir'd,Rose up at once, and with their Virtue quell'd themQUEEN.Thanks to their honest, to their loyal Hearts.But say, were any Persons else concern'dOf high Distinction, or of noted Rank?BURLEIGH.Yes, Madam, many more, seduc'd of late;'Mong whom the bold outhampton foremost stands,Precipitate and rash; whose Pow'r, tho' great,Lags far behind his Will to do you hurt.They're now our Pris'ners and are sate secur'd;But Essex with Southampton, and the restOf greater Note, I would not dare dispose of,Without your Royal Mandate; and they nowAttend without, to know your final Pleasure.QUEEN.Is this the just Return of all my Care?My anxious toilsome Days, and watchful Nights?Have I sent forth a Wish, that went not freightedWith all my People's Good? Or, have I LifeOr Length of Days defir'd, but for their Sake?
The Public Good is all my Private Care.Have I not ever thought the meanest Subject,Opprest by Power, was, in his just Complaint,Above a King? What British Bosom hasBy foreign Tyranny been griev'd, whose WrongsI have not felt as mine, as mine redress'd?Or have I justly made a single ManMy Foe? Then cou'd I think this grateful IsleContain'd one Traitor's Heart? But, least of allThat Essex' Breast should lodge it? Call the Monster,And let me meet this Rebel, Face to Face.Do you withdraw and wait within our Call.Exit Burl. &c.Enter ESSEX.You see we dare abide your dang'rous Presence,Tho' Treason sits within your Heart enthron'd,And on that Brow Rebellion lowrs, where onceSuch boasted Loyalty was said to flourish.How low the Traitor can degrade the Soldier!Guilt glares in conscious Dyes upon thy Cheek,And inward Horror trembles in thine Eye.How mean is Fraud! how base Ingratitude!ESSEX.Forbear Reproach, thou injur'd Majesty,Nor wound, with piercing Words, a Heart alreadyWith Anguish torn, and bleeding with Remorse.Your awful Looks, alone, are arm'd with Death,And Justice gives them Terror.QUEEN.Hapless Man!What Cause could prompt, what Fiend could urgetheeonTo this detested Deed? Could I from theeExpect to meet this base Return? From thee,To whom I ought to fly, with all the Considence
That giving Bounty ever could inspire,Or seeming Gratitude and Worth could promise?ESSEX.Alas, I own my Crimes, and feel my Treasons;They press me down beneath the Reach of Pity.Despair alone can shield me from myself.Oh let the little Space I live be curs'dWith countless Woes; let Death unpitied, come;My Name be mention'd with the utmost Scorn!If all my Life can feel, or Fame can suffer,May serve to mitigate my Queen's Displeasure.QUEEN.My Pride forbids me to reproach thee more:My Pity rather would relieve thy Sorrow.I see Conviction, and severe Remorse,Within thy Mind, at work. But much I fearThat Death alone can calm the raging Conflict.The People's Clamours, and my special Safety,Call loud for Justice, and demand your Life.But if Forgiveness from an injur'd QueenCan make the few short Hours you live more easy,I give it freely from my pitying Heart;And wish my willing Power could grant thee more.ESSEX.O Sounds angelic! Goodness undeserv'd!My swelling Heart can keep no Bounds, my SoulFlows o'er.—And will my gracious Queen forgive me?Oh let me prostrate thus before you fall,My better Angel, and my Guardian Genius!Permit me, royal Mistress, to pronounceMy faithful Sentiments, my Soul's true Dictates;Vouchsafe your Essex but this one Request,This only Boon, he'll thank you with his last,His dying Breath, and bless you in his Passage.QUEEN.Rise, my Lord.If aught you have to offer can allay
Your Woes, and reconcile you to your Fate,Proceed;—and I with patient Ear will listen.ESSEX.My real Errors, and my seeming Crimes,Would weary Mercy, and make Goodness poor:And yet the Source of all my greatest FaultsWas Loyalty misled, and Duty in Extreme.So jealous was my sanguine Heart, so warmAffection's Zeal, I could not bear the leastSuspicion of my Duty to my Queen.This drove me from my high Command in Ireland,This too impell'd me to that rude BehaviourWhich justly urg'd the shameful Blow I felt.And this (O fatal Rashness!) made me thinkMy Queen had given her Essex up, a VictimTo Statesmen's Schemes, and wicked Policy.Stung by that piercing Thought, my Madness flewBeyond all Bounds, and now alas has brought meTo this most shameful Fall; and, what's still worse,My own Reproaches, and my Queen's Displeasure.QUEEN.Unhappy Man! My yielding Soul is touch'd,And Pity pleads thy Cause within my Breast.ESSEX.Say but, my gracious Sov'reign, ere I goFor ever from your Presence, that you think meGuiltless of all Attempts against your Throne,And sacred Life. Your faithful Essex ne'erCould harbour in his Breast so soul a Thought.Believe it not, my Queen. By Heav'n I swear,When in my highest Pitch of Glory rais'd,The splendid Noon of Fortune's brightest Sun-shine,Not Ages of Renown, could yield me halfThe Joy, nor make my Life so greatly blest,As saving yours, tho' for a single Hour.QUEEN.My Lord, I think you honest. Nay, I own,Whatever Coldness I put on, was meantTo save you from the Malice of your Foes.I judg'd your Crimes, what you yourself pronounc'd 'em,The rash Effect of an intemp'rate Zeal.ESSEX.Was ever Wretch like Essex, thus undoneBy Goodness in Excess, and lavish'd Grace!Oh I could tear my erring Heart with theseRevenging Hands! — What Blessings have I lost!What Clemency abus'd! — Now could I wishFor lengthen'd Life—indeed, for endless Years.A whole Eternity's too short, to shewMy pious Sorrows, and attone my Folly.QUEEN.Too well the Passage to my Heart he finds;And Pity's Hand lets in the dangerous Guest.How weak is Reason, when oppos'd to Nature!Aside.My Lord, I would convince you that I stillRegard your Life, and labour to preserve it;But cannot screen you from a public Trial.With Prudence make your best Defence; but shouldSeverity her Iron JurisdictionExtend too far, and give thee up condemn'dTo angry Laws, thy Queen will not forget thee.Yet, left you then shou'd want a faithful Friend,(For Friends will fly you in the Time of Need)Here, from my Finger take this Ring; a PledgeOf Mercy, having this, you ne'er shall needAn Advocate with me; for whensoeverYou give, or send it back, by Heav'n I swear,As I do hope for Mercy on my Soul,That I will grant whatever Boon you ask.ESSEX.O Grace surprizing! most amazing Goodness!Words cannot paint the Transport of my Soul.Let me receive it on my grateful Knees,At once to thank and bless the Hand that gives it.QUEEN.Depend, my Lord, on this; 'twixt you and meThis Ring shall be a private Mark of FaithGives the Ring.Inviolate. Be consident, chear up,Dispel each melancholy Fear, and trustYour Sovereign's Promise; she will ne'er forsake you.ESSEX.Let Providence dispose my Lot as 'twill,May watchful Angels ever guard my Queen;May healing Wisdom in her Counsels reign,And firm Fidelity surround her Throne;May Victory her dreaded Banners bear,And joyful Conquests crown her Soldiers Brow;Let every Bliss be mingled in her Cup,And Heaven at last become her great Reward.Exit.QUEEN.Who waits there?Enter BURLEIGH and OFFICERS.Guard your Pris'ner safe. 'Tis done;And yet foreboding Tremors shake my Heart.Something sits heavy here, and presses downMy Spirits with it's Weight. What can it mean?Suppose he is condemn'd, my royal WordIs plighted for his Life; his EnemiesNo doubt will censure much.—No Matter,—let 'ern.I know him honest, and despise their Malice.Unhappy State, where Mercy and CompassionToo often meet with Clamour and Reproach;But Princes must endure, for public Good,
The narrow Censures of misguiding Crowds.Enter Countess of RUTLAND.RUTLAND.Where is the Queen? I'll fall before her FeetProstrate, implore, besiege her royal Heart,And force her to forgive.QUEEN.What means this Frenzy?RUTLAND.O gracious Queen, if ever Pity touch'dYour gen'rous Breast, let not the cruel AxDestroy his precious Life; preserve my Essex,Preserve, from shameful Death, the noble, loyal,O save the brave,—the best of Subjects.—SaveMy Life! my Hope! my Joy! my All! my Husband!QUEEN.Husband! What sudden deadly Blow is this!Hold up, my Soul, nor sink beneath this Wound.You beg a Traitor's Life!RUTLAND.O gracious Queen!He ever lov'd,—was ever faithful, brave.—If Nature dwells about your Heart, O spurnMe not; my Lord! my Love! my Husband bleeds!QUEEN.Take her away.RUTLAND.I cannot let you go.Hold off your Hands.—Here on this Spot I'll fix,Here lose all Sense; still let me stretch these Arms,Inexorable Queen, he yet may live.O give him to my poor afflicted Heart!One pitying Look, to save me from Distraction.QUEEN.I'll hear no more. I'm tortur'd—take her hence.RUTLAND.Nay, force me not away.—Inhuman Wretches!O Mercy! Mercy!—Then to thee, good Heav'n,(My Queen, my cruel Queen, denies to hear me)To thee I call, to thee for Mercy bend.Melt down her Bosom's frozen Sense to feelSome Portion of my deadly Grief, my fellDistraction. Turn, O turn, and see a Wife,A tortur'd Wife. —QUEEN.Why am I not obey'd?RUTLAND.Nay, do not thusAbandon me to sell Despair. Just Heaven,That sees my Sorrows, will avenge the Wrong,This cruel Wrong, this barbarous Tyranny.Forc'd off.QUEEN.Wedded to Rutland! Most unhappy Pair!And Oh ill-sated Queen! Never till nowDid Sorrow settle in thy Heart it's Throne.Now black Despair it's cloudy Curtain drawsAround thy setting Peace, where, Joy, alasNo more shall dawn, nor smiling Hope return.Recal my Pledge of Safety from his Hands,And give him up to Death!—But Life or DeathTo me is equal now. Distraction dwellsWithin my tortur'd Soul, and Furies rend it.Unhappy State, where Peace shall never come!One fatal Moment has confirm'd my Doom,Turn'd all my Comfort to intestine Strife,And sill'd with mortal Pangs, my future Life.Exit.ACT V.Enter RALEIGH, and Lieutenant of the Tower.RALEIGH.THeir Peers, with much Indulgence, heard their Plea,And gave them ample Scope for their Defence;But nought avail'd, their Crimes were too notorious.They bore their Sentence with becoming Spirit;And here's the Royal Mandate for their Deaths.—The Lady Nottingham!—What brings her hither!Enter NOTTINGHAM.NOTTINGHAM.Lieutenant, lead me to the Earl of Essex.I bring a Message to him from the Queen.LIEUTENANT.He's with his Friend the brave Southampton, Madam,Preparing now for their expected Fate.But I'll acquaint his Lordship with your Pleasure.Ex.RALEIGH.What means this Message? Does the Queen relent?NOTTINGHAM.I fear she does: for such a War of Passions,Such varying Tumults never strove withinHer Breast till now. Sometimes she rails at Essex,And calls him Villain, Traitor, dooms him dead;Yet in a Moment turns again to Pity.At length she sent me to th' ungratesul Earl,
To learn if he could offer aught that mightInduce her Royal Mercy to Forgiveness.Go you to Court, for Cecil there expects you.I've promis'd to acquaint him with what passes'Twixt me and Essex ere I see the Queen.RALEIGH.Madam, I go.Exit.NOTTINGHAM.Now Vengeance steel my Heart!Offended Woman, whilst her Pride remains,To Malice only, and Revenge will bow;And every Virtue at that Altar sacrifice.But see, he comes, with manly Sorrow clad.There was a Time, that Presence cou'd subdueMy Pride, and melt my Heart to gentle Pity.I then could find no Joy but in his Smiles;And thought him lovely as the Summer's Bloom;But all his Beauties now are hateful grown.Enter ESSEX.ESSEX.Whether you bring me Death or Life I know not.But, if strict Friendship and Remembrance pastMay aught presage to my afflicted Heart,Sure Mercy only from those Lips should flow,And Grace be utter'd by that friendly Tongue.NOTTINGHAM.My Lord, I'm glad you think me still your Friend.I come not to upbraid but serve you now;And pleas'd I am, to be the MessengerOf such glad Tidings in the Day of Trouble,As now I bring you. When the Queen had heardThat by the Lords you were condemn'd to die,She sent me, in her Mercy, here to know,If you had aught to offer that might moveHer Royal Clemency to spare your Life.ESSEX.Could any Circumstance new Lustre addTo my dread Sovereign's Goodness, 'tis the makingThe kind, the generous Nottingham it's Messenger.O Madam, cou'd my glowing Heart expressIts grateful Sentiments, 'twou'd speak such LanguageAs Angels utter, when they praise their Maker.NOTTINGAAM.'Tis well, my Lord; but there's no Time to spare,The Queen impatient waits for my Return.ESSEX.My Heart was wishing for some faithful Friend,And bounteous Heav'n hath sent thee to my Hopes.Know then, kind Nottingham (for now I'll trustThee with the dearest Secret of my Life'Tis not long since the Queen (who well soresawTo what the Malice of my Foes wou'd drive me)Gave me this Ring, this sacred Pledge of Mercy;And with it, made a solemn Vow to Heav'n,That, whensoever I should give or sendIt back again, she'd freely grant whate'erRequest I then shou'd make.NOTTINGHAM.Give, give it me,My Lord, and let me fly on Friendship's Wings,To bear it to the Queen, and to it addMy Prayers and Influence to preserve thy Life.ESSEX.O take it then,—it is the Pledge of Life,The precious Spring that drives my Vital StreamAround, and keeps my Heart still warm: it isThe Door of Breath, the Hope of Joy, the ShieldOf Friendship.—O it is my dear Southampton'sLast, last remaining Stay, his Thread of Being!Which more than Worlds I prize.—O take it then,Take it, thou Guardian Angel of my Life,And offer up the Incense of thy Pray'r!
O beg, intreat, implore her Majesty,From public Shame, and ignominious Death,And from th' obdurate Ax, to save my Friend.NOTTINGHAM.My Lord, with all the Pow'rs that Nature gave,And Friendship can inspire, I'll urge the QueenTo grant you your Request.ESSEX.Kind Nottingham,Your pious Offices shall ever beMy servent Theme; and if my doubtful SpanRelenting Heav'n should stretch to Years remote,Each passing Hour shall still remind my Thoughts,And tell me that I owe my All to thee.My Friend shall thank you too for lengthen'd Life.And now I'll fly with Comfort to his Arms,To let him know the Mercy that you bring.Exit.NOTTINGHAM.Yes, you shall feel my Friendship's Weight fall heavyUpon your guilty Soul, ungrateful Man!Your salse, disdainful Heart shall pay the FineOf Love neglected, and of Beauty scorn'd.SCENE the Court.Enter QUEEN, BURLEIGH.QUEEN.Ha! is not Nottingham return'd?BURLEIGH.No Madam.QUEEN.Dispatch a speedy Messenger to haste her.My agitated Heart can find no rest,So near the Brink of Fate.—Unhappy Man!Enter NOTTINGHAM.How now, my Nottingham, what News from Essex?What says the Earl?NOTTINGHAM.I wish, with all my Soul,Th' ungrateful Task had been another's Lot,I dread to tell it.—Lost, ill sated Man!QUEEN.What means this Mystery, this strange Behaviour?Pronounce—declare at once; what said the Earl?NOTTINGHAM.Alas, my Queen, I fear to say; his MindIs in the strangest Mood, that ever PrideOn blackest Thoughts begot. He scarce wou'd speak.And when he did, it was with Sullenness,With hasty Tone, and down-cast Look.QUEEN.Amazing!Not feel the Terrors of approaching Death!Nor yet the joyful Dawn of promis'd Life!NOTTINGHAM.He rather seem'd insensible to both,And with a cold Indifference heard your Offer;Till warming up, by slow Degrees, ResentmentBegan to swell his restless, haughty Mind,And proud Disdain provok'd him to exclaimAloud, against the partial Power of Fortune,And Faction's Rage.—I beg'd him to considerHis sad Condition, nor repulse with Scorn,The only Hand that could preserve him.QUEEN.Ha!What! said he nothing of a private import?No Circumstance—no Pledge—no Ring!NOTTINGHAM.None, Madam,But with contemptuous Front disclaim'd at onceYour prosser'd Grace; and scorn'd, he said, a LifeUpon such Terms bestow'd.QUEEN.Impossible!Could Essex treat me thus? You basely wrong him,And wrest his Meaning from the purpos'd Point.Recall betimes the horrid Words you've utter'd!Confess, and own the whole you've said was salse.NOTTINGHAM.Madam, by Truth, and Duty both compell'd,Against the Pleadings of my pitying Soul,I must declare (Heaven knows with what Reluctance)That never Pride insulted Mercy more.He ran o'er all the Dangers he had past:His mighty Deeds; his Service to the State;Accus'd your Majesty of partial leaningTo favourite Lords, to whom he falls a Sacrifice;Appeals to Justice, and to future Times,How much he feels from proud Oppression's Arm.Nay, something too he darkly hinted at,Of jealous Disappointment, and Revenge.QUEEN.Eternal Silence seal thy venom'd Lips!What hast thou utter'd, Wretch, to rouze at onceA Whirlwind in my Soul, which roots up Pity,And destroys my Peace?Ha! he desies me then! Audacious Traytor!Let him this Instant to the Block be led.Exit Not.Upbraid me with my fatal Fondness for him!Ungrateful, barbarous Russian! Oh Elizabeth,Remember now thy long establish'd Fame,Thy envy'd Glory, and thy Father's Spirit!Accuse me of Injustice too, and Cruelty!Yes, I'll this Instant to the Tower, forget
My regal State, and to his Face confront him:Confound th' audacious Villain with my Presence,And add new Terrors to th' uplifted Ax.Exit.SCENE the Tower.ESSEX and SOUTHAMPTON discovered.ESSEX.O name it not, my Friend shall live, he shall;I know her royal Mercy, and her GoodnessWill give you back to Life, to length of Days,And me, to Honour, Loyalty, and Truth.Death is still distant far.SOUTHAMPTON,In Life's first Spring,Our green Affections grew apace, and prosper'd;The genial Summer swell'd our joyful Hearts,To meet and mix each growing fruitful Wish.We're now embark'd upon that stormy FloodWhere all the Wise and Brave are gone before us,Ere since the Birth of Time, to meet Eternity.And what is Death, did we consider right?Shall we, who sought him in the Paths of Terror,And fac'd him in the dreadful Walks of War;Shall we, astonish'd, shrink, like frighted insants,And start at Scaffolds, and their gloomy Trappings?ESSEX.Yet still I trust long Years remain of friendship.—Let smiling Hope drive Doubt and Fear away,And Death be banish'd far; where creeping Age,Disease and Care, invite him to their Dwelling.I feel Assurance rise within my Breast,That all will yet be well.SOUTHAMPTON.Count not on Hope—We never can take Leave, my Friend, of Life,
On nobler Terms. Life! what is Life! A Shadow!Its Date is but th' immediate Breath we draw;Nor have we Surety for a second Gale.Ten thousand Accidents in Ambush lieFor the embody'd Dream.A frail and fickle Tenement it is;Which like the brittle Glass, that measures Time,Is often broke, ere half its Sands are run.ESSEX.Such cold Philosophy the Heart disdains;And Friendship shudders at the moral Tale.My Friend, the fearful Precipice is past,And Danger dare not meet us more. Fly swist,Ye better Angels, wast the welcome TidingsOf Pardon, to my Friend; of Life and Joy.Enter LIEUTENANT.LIEUTENANT.I grieve to be the Messenger of Woe.But must, my Lords, intreat you to prepareFor instant Death. Here is the royal MandateThat orders your immediate Execution.ESSEX.Immediate Execution!—What, so sudden!No Message from the Queen? or Nottingham?LIEUTENANT.None, Sir.ESSEX.Deluded Hopes! O worse than Death!Persidious Queen, to make a Mock of Life!My Friend, my Friend destroy'd! O piercing Thought!O dismal Chance!—In my Destruction ruin'd!In my sad Fall undone! Why could not mine,My Life attone for both; my Blood appease?Can you, my Friend, forgive me?SOUTHAMPTON.Yes, O yes,
My Bosom's better Half, I can. With theeI'll gladly seek the Coast unknown, and leaveThe lessening Mark of irksome Life behind.With thee, my Friend, 'tis Joy to die! 'tis Glory!For who wou'd wait the tardy Stroke of Time,Or cling like Reptiles to the Verge of Being,When we can bravely leap from Life at once,And spring triumphant in a Friend's Embrace?Enter RALEIGH.RALEIGH.To you, my Lord Southampton, from the QueenA Pardon comes: Your Life her Mercy spares.ESSEX.For ever blest be that indulgent PowerWhich saves my Friend. This Weight ta'en off, my SoulShall upward spring, and mingle with the Blest.SOUTHAMPTON.All-ruling Heavens, can this, can this be just?Support me, hold, ye straining Heart-strings hold,And keep my sinking Frame from Dissolution.O 'tis too much for mortal Strength to bear,Or Thought to suffer! No, I'll die with thee.They shall not part us, Essex.ESSEX.Live, O live,Thou noblest, bravest, best of Men and Friends!Whilst Life is worth thy Wish, till Time and thouAgree to part, and Nature send thee to me;Thou gen'rous Soul, farewel;—live and be happy;And, Oh, may Life make largely up to theeWhatever Blessing Fate has thus cut offFrom thy departing Friend.LIEUTENANT.My Lord, my WarrantStrictly forbids to grant a Moment's Time.SOUTHAMPTON.Oh must we part for ever!—Cruel Fortune!Wilt thou then tear him hence?—Severe Divorce!Let me cling round thy sacred Person still,Still clasp thee to my Bosom close, and keepStern Fate at Distance.ESSEX.O my Friend, we'll meetAgain where Virtue finds a just Reward,Where factious Malice never more can reach us.Recall thy Reasoh, be thyself once more.—I fear it not.—This hideous Monster, Death,When seen at Distance, shocks weak Nature's Eye;But Reason, as it draws more near, defies it.—I thank thy Sorrows, but cou'd spare 'em now.I need not bid thee guard my Fame from Wrongs:And, Oh! a dearer Treasure to thy CareI trust, than either Life or Fame—my Wife.Her bitter Sorrows pierce my Soul; for herMy Heart drops Blood!—Oh, she will want a Friend.Then take her to thy Care; do thou pour BalmOn her deep-wounded Spirit, and let her findMy tender Helps in thee.—I must be gone,My ever faithful, and my gallant Friend.—I prithee leave this Woman's Work.—Farewel.—Take this last, dear Embrace.—Farewel for ever!SOUTHAMPTON.My bursting Breast!—I fain would speak, but WordsAre poor.—Farewel!—But we shall meet again, embrace in oneEternal Band, which never shall be loos'd.Exit.ESSEX.To Death's concluding Stroke, lead on, Lieutenant.My Wife!—Now Reason, Fortitude, support me;For now, indeed, comes on my forest Trial.Enter Countess of RUTLAND.Oh thou last, dear Reserve of Fortune's Malice;For Fate can add no more!—Oh com'st thou thenIn this dread Hour, when all my straining ThoughtsAre struggling in the tenderest Ties of Nature;Oh com'st thou now t' arrest my parting Soul,And force it back to Life!RUTLAND.Thou sole Delight,Thou only Joy which Life cou'd ever give,Or Death deprive me of, my wedded Lord!I come, with thee determin'd to endureThe utmost Rigour of our angry Stars,To join thee, fearless, in the Grasp of Death,And seek some Dwelling in a World beyond it.ESSEX.Too much, thou Partner of this dismal Hour,Thy gen'rous Soul wou'd prompt thee to endure;Nor can thy tender, trembling Heart sustain it.Long Years of Bliss remain in Store for thee,And smiling Time his Treasures shall unfoldTo bribe thy Stay.RUTLAND.Thou cruel Comforter!Alas! what's Life! what's hated Life to me?Can aught beneath this starry Hemisphere,Which Earth's Extent, and Nature's Wealth can yield,Which proud Ambition stretches to enjoy,Or Passion pants or, recompense thy Loss?Alas, this Universe, this goodly Frame,Shall all as one continued Curse appear,And every Object blast when thou art gone.ESSEX.O strain not thus the little Strength I've left,The weak Support that holds up Life, to bear
A few short Moments more, its Weight of Woe,Its Loss of thee. O turn away those Eyes,Nor with that Look melt down my fixt Resolve;And yet a little longer let me gazeOn that lov'd Form. Alas, I feel my SightGrows dim, and Reason from her Throne retire;For Pity's Sake let go my breaking Heart,And leave me to my Fate.RUTLAND.Why wilt thou stillOf parting talk; since Life its thousand GatesUnbars to let us thro' together. DeathIs but a Step that reaches to Eternity.O that the friendly Hand of Heav'n wou'd snatchUs both, at once, above the distant Stars!Where Fortune's venom'd Shafts can never pierce,Nor cruel Queens destroy!—Nay look not so.ESSEX.The awful Searcher, whose impartial EyeExplores the Secrets of each human Heart,And every Thought surveys, can witness for me,How close thy Image clings around my Soul;Retards each rising Wish, and draws me backTo Life, entangled by thy lov'd Idea.When fell Necessity those Ties shall break,For quickly break they must—when I from EarthOn Faith's white Angel Wings to Heaven shall soar,Thy lasting Form shall still my Mind possess,Where Bliss supreme each Faculty o'erwhelms,And raptur'd Angels glow.—LIEUTENANT.My Lord, the TimeToo far is stretch'd, it now grows late.ESSEX.Lead on.RUTLAND.Stay, stay, my Love, my dearest, dying Lord!
Ah whither wouldst thou go? Ah, do not leave me!Alas, I'll hasten to attend your Flight;And Nature gives Consent we should not part.I feel each Faculty for Fate prepare,And my quick Soul wou'd fain set out before you.O precious Pangs!—O dear Distress!—still closerTo thy quick throbbing Heart let mine complain,And on thy labouring Bosom breathe my last.Faints.ESSEX.Thou sinking Excellence! thou matchless Woman!Shall Fortune rob me of thy dear Embrace,Or Earth's whole Power, or Death divide us now!Stay, stay, thou spotless, injur'd Saint, and take—LIEUTENANT.My Lord, already you have been indulg'dBeyond what I can warrant by my Orders.ESSEX.Oh let me on her dying Bosom fall,Embrace her spotless Form.—One Moment moreAfford me to my Sorrows.—Oh! look there!—Cou'd bitter Anguish pierce your Heart, like mine,You'd pity now the mortal Pangs I feel,The Throbs that tear my vital Strings away,And rend my agonizing Soul.—LIEUTENANT.My Lord.ESSEX.But one short Moment more, and I attend.Ye sacred Ministers, that Virtue guard,And shield the Righteous in the Paths of Peril,Restore her back to Life, and lengthen'd YearsOf Joy; dry up her bleeding Sorrows all:O cancel from her Thoughts this dismal Hour,And blot my Image from her sad Reembrance.'Tis done.—And now, ye trembling Cords of Life give way:
Nature and Time let go your Hold; EternityDemands me.Exeunt Essex, Lieutenant.WOMAN.She returns to Life, see! help!RUTLAND.Where has my lost benighted Soul been wandring?What means this Mist that hangs about my Mind?Thro' which Reflection's painful Eye discernsImperfect Forms, and horrid Shapes of Woe.The Cloud dispels, the Shades withdraw, and allMy dreadful Fate appears.—O where's my Lord?My Life! my Essex! O whither have they ta'en him?Enter QUEEN and Attendants.QUEEN.To Execution! fly with Lightning's Wings,And save him. Hah! by whose Command was this?Stop, stop the fatal Blow.—My Fears were true.Exit one of the Attendants.RUTLAND.Thou saving Angel sent from Heaven! my Queen,My gracious Queen, be quick!—the bloody Burleigh!A Moment may destroy him. Stretch thy Arm,Defend, defend, O shatch him from the Blow!Preserve my Husband! O Elizabeth,Look down upon me. Angels move her HeartTo pity, save him, save him, gracious Queen.QUEEN.Be calm, he shall not die. Rise up. I cameTo save his Life.RUTLAND.'Tis Mercy's Voice that speaks.My Essex shall again be mine. My Queen,My bounteous, gracious Queen has said the Word.May Troops of Angels guard thy sacred Life,
And, in thy latest Moments, wast thy SoulTo meet that Mercy, in the Realms of Joy,Which now thy royal Goodness grants to me.Enter BURLEIGH.BURLEIGH.Madam, your Orders came, alas! too late.Ere they arriv'd the Ax had fall'n on Essex.RUTLAND.Ha! dead! What Hell is this that opens round me?What Fiend art thou that draws the horrid Scene?Hah Burleigh! bloody Murd'rer, where's my Husband!O where's my Lord, my Essex?Destruction seize and Madness rend my Brain.See, see, they bend him to the fatal Block;Now now the horrid Ax is lifted high,It falls, it falls, he bleeds, he bleeds, he dies!QUEEN.Alas, her Sorrows pierce my suffering Heart.RUTLAND.Eternal Discord tear the social World,And Nature's Laws dissolve! expunge, eraseThe hated Marks of Time's engraving Hand,And every Trace destroy! Arise, Despair,Assert thy rightful Claim, possess me all!Bear, bear me to my murther'd Lord, to claspHis bleeding Body in my dying Arms;And in the Tomb embrace his dear Remains,And mingle with his Dust for ever.Exit.QUEEN.Hapless Woman!She shall henceforth be Partner of my Sorrows.And we'll contend who most shall weep for Essex.O quick to kill, and ready to destroy,To Burleigh.Cou'd no Pretext be found, no Cause appear,
To lengthen Mercy out a Moment more,And stretch the Span of Grace? O cruel Burleigh!This, this was thy dark Work, unpitying Man!BURLEIGH.My gracious Mistress, blame not thus my Duty,My firm Obedience to your high Command.The Laws condemn'd him first to die; nor thinkI stood between your Mercy and his Life.It was the Lady Notingham, not I.Herself confess'd it all, in wild Despair,That from your Majesty to Essex sent,With Terms of proffer'd Grace, she then receiv'dFrom his own Hand a fatal Ring, a Pledge,It seems, of much Importance, which the Earl,With earnest Suit, and warm Entreaty, begg'd her,As she would prize his Life, to give your Majesty.In this she fail'd—in this she murder'd Essex.QUEEN.O barbarous Woman!Surrounded still by Treachery and Fraud!What bloody Deed is this? Thou injur'd Essex!My Fame is soil'd to all succeeding Times:But Heav'n alone can view my breaking Heart;Then let it's Will be done.—From hence let proud, resisting Mortals knowThe Arm parental, and th' indulgent Blow.To Heav'n's corrective Rod, submissive, bend,Adore it's Wisdom, on it's Power depend;Whilst ruling Justice guides eternal Sway,Let Nature tremble, and let Man obey.EPILOGUE.By an Unknown Hand. Spoken by Mrs. CIBBER.NEWS! News! good Folks, rare News, and you shall know it—I've got Intelligence about our Poet!Who do you think be is?—You'll never guess;An IRISH BRICKLAYER, neither more or less.And now the Secret's out, you cannot wonder,That in commencing Bard he made a Blunder.Has be not left the Better for the Worse,In quitting Solid Brick for empty Verse?Can he believe th' Example of Old Ben,Who chang'd (like him) the Trowel for the Pen,Will in his Favour move your Critic Bowels?You rather wish, most Poct's Pons were Trowels,Our Man is honest, sensible, and plain,Nor has the Poet made him pert, or vain:No Beau, no Courtier, nor conceited Youth;But then so rude, he always speaks the Truth:I told him he must flatter, learn Address,And gain the Heart of some rich Patroness:'Tis she, said I, your Labours will reward,If you but join the Bricklay'r with the Bard;As thus—Should she be old and worse for Wear,You must new-case her, front her and repair;If crack'd in Fame, as scarce to bear a Touch,You cannot use your Trowel then too much;
In short, whate'er her Morals, Age or Station,Plaister and white-wash in your Dedication.Thus I advis'd—but he detests the Plan:What can be done with such a simple Man?A Poet's nothing worth and nought availing,Unless he'll furnish, where there is a Failing.Authors in these good Times are made and us'd,To grant those Favours Nature has refus'd.If he won't fib, what Bounty can be crave?We pay for what we want, not what we have.—Nay tho' of every Blessing we have store,Our Sex will always wish—a little more.—If he'll not bend his Heart to this his Duty,And sell (to who will buy) Wit, Honour, Beauty;The Bricklay'r still for him the proper Trade is,Too rough to deal with Gentlemen and Ladies.—In short—they'll all avoid him and neglect him,Unless that you his Patrons will protect him.FINIS.
