1785.ADVERTISEMENT.THE history of the following production is briefly
this. A lady, fond of blank verse, demanded
a poem of that kind from the author, and gave him
the SOFA for a subject. He obeyed; and having
much leisure, connected another subject with it;
and pursuing the train of thought to which his situation
and turn of mind led him, brought forth at
length, instead of the trifle which he at first intended,
a serious affair—a Volume.In the poem, on the subject of education
he would be very sorry to stand suspected of having
aimed his censure at any particular school. His objections
are such as naturally apply themselves to schools
in general. If there were not, as for the most part
there is, wilful neglect in those who manage them, and

an omission even of such discipline as they are susceptible
of, the objects are yet too numerous for minute attention;
and the aching hearts of ten thousand parents
mourning under the bitterest of all disappointments, attest
the truth of the allegation. His quarrel therefore is
with the mischief at large, and not with any particular
instance of it,ARGUMENT of the FIRST BOOK.Historical deduction of seats, from the stool to the Sofa.—

scene described.—Rural sounds as well as sights delightful.
—Another walk.—Mistake concerning the
charms of solitude, corrected.—Colonnades commended.

That state most favourable to virtue.—The South Sea
Islanders compassionated, but chiefly Omai.—His present

virtue, but not great cities.—Great cities, and London
in particular, allowed their due praise, but censured.—
Fete Champetre.—The book concludes with a reflection
on the fatal effects of dissipation and effeminacy
upon our public measures.BOOK I.THE SOFA.I SING the SOFA. I who lately sangTruth, Hope and Charity, and touch'd with aweThe solemn chords, and with a trembling hand,Escap'd with pain from that advent'rous flight,Now seek repose upon an humbler theme;The theme though humble, yet august and proudTh' occasion—for the Fair commands the song.Time was, when cloathing sumptuous or for use,Save their own painted skins, our sires had none.As yet black breeches were not; sattin smooth,
Or velvet soft, or plush with shaggy pile:The hardy chief upon the rugged rockWash'd by the sea, or on the grav'ly bankThrown up by wintry torrents roaring loud,Fearless of wrong, repos'd his weary strength.Those barb'rous ages past, succeeded nextThe birth-day of invention, weak at first,Dull in design, and clumsy to perform.Joint-stools were then created; on three legsUpborne they stood. Three legs upholding firmA massy slab, in fashion square or round.On such a stool immortal Alfred sat,And sway'd the sceptre of his infant realms;And such in ancient halls and mansions drearMay still be seen, but perforated soreAnd drill'd in holes the solid oak is found,By worms voracious eating through and through.At length a generation more refinedImprov'd the simple plan, made three legs four,
Gave them a twisted form vermicular,And o'er the seat with plenteous wadding stuff'dInduced a splendid cover green and blue,Yellow and red, of tapestry richly wroughtAnd woven close, or needle-work sublime.There might ye see the pioney spread wide,The full-blown rose, the shepherd and his lass,Lap-dog and lambkin with black staring eyes,And parrots with twin cherries in their beak.Now came the cane from India, smooth and brightWith Nature's varnish; sever'd into stripesThat interlaced each other, these suppliedOf texture firm a lattice work, that bracedThe new machine, and it became a chair.But restless was the chair; the back erectDistress'd the weary loins that felt no ease;The slipp'ry seat betray'd the sliding partThat press'd it, and the feet hung dangling down,Anxious in vain to find the distant floor.
These for the rich: the rest, whom fate had placedIn modest mediocrity, contentWith base materials, sat on well tann'd hidesObdurate and unyielding, glassy smooth,With here and there a tuft of crimson yarn,Or scarlet crewel in the cushion fixt:If cushion might be call'd, what harder seem'dThan the firm oak of which the frame was form'd.No want of timber then was felt or fear'dIn Albion's happy isle. The umber stoodPond'rous, and fixt by its own massy weight.But elbows still were wanting; these, some say,An Alderman of Cripplegate contrived,And some ascribe the invention to a priestBurly and big and studious of his ease.But rude at first, and not with easy slopeReceding wide, they press'd against the ribs,And bruised the side, and elevated highTaught the rais'd shoulders to invade the ears.Long time elapsed or e'er our rugged sires
Complain'd, though incommodiously pent in,And ill at ease behind. The Ladies first'Gan murmur, as became the softer sex.Ingenious fancy, never better pleas'dThan when employ'd t' accommodate the fair,Heard the sweet moan with pity, and devisedThe soft settee; one elbow at each end,And in the midst an elbow, it receiv'dUnited yet divided, twain at once.So sit two Kings of Brentford on one throne;And so two citizens who take the airClose pack'd and smiling in a chaise and one.But relaxation of the languid frameBy soft recumbency of outstretched limbs,Was bliss reserved for happier days. So slowThe growth of what is excellent, so hardT'attain perfection in this nether world.Thus first necessity invented stools,Convenience next suggested elbow chairs,And luxury th' accomplished Sofa last.The nurse sleeps sweetly, hired to watch the sickWhom snoring she disturbs. As sweetly heWho quits the coach-box at the midnight hourTo sleep within the carriage more secure,His legs depending at the open door.Sweet sleep enjoys the Curate in his desk,The tedious Rector drawling o'er his head,And sweet the Clerk below: but neither sleepOf lazy Nurse, who snores the sick man dead,Nor his who quits the box at midnight hourTo slumber in the carriage more secure,Nor sleep enjoy'd by Curate in his desk,Nor yet the dozings of the Clerk are sweet,Compared with the repose the SOFA yields.Oh may I live exempted (while I liveGuiltless of pamper'd appetite obscene)From pangs arthritic that infest the toeOf libertine excess. The SOFA suitsThe gouty limb, 'tis true; but gouty limb
Though on a SOFA, may I never feel:For I have loved the rural walk through lanesOf grassy swarth close cropt by nibbling sheep,And skirted thick with intertexture firmOf thorny boughs: have loved the rural walkO'er hills, through valleys, and by rivers brink,E'er since a truant boy I pass'd my boundsT'enjoy a ramble on the banks of Thames.And still remember, nor without regretOf hours that sorrow since has much endear'd,How oft, my slice of pocket store consumed,Still hung'ring pennyless and far from home,I fed on scarlet hips and stoney haws,Or blushing crabs, or berries that imbossThe bramble, black as jet, or sloes austere.Hard fare! but such as boyish appetiteDisdains not, nor the palate undepravedBy culinary arts, unsav'ry deems.No SOFA then awaited my return,Nor SOFA then I needed. Youth repairs
His wasted spirits quickly, by long toilIncurring short fatigue; and though our yearsAs life declines, speed rapidly away,And not a year but pilfers as he goesSome youthful grace that age would gladly keep,A tooth or auburn lock, and by degreesTheir length and color from the locks they spare;Th' elastic spring of an unwearied footThat mounts the stile with ease, or leaps the fence,That play of lungs inhaling and againRespiring freely the fresh air, that makesSwift pace or steep ascent no toil to me,Mine have not pilfer'd yet; nor yet impair'dMy relish of fair prospect; scenes that sooth'dOr charm'd me young, no longer young, I findStill soothing and of power to charm me still.And witness, dear companion of my walks,Whose arm this twentieth winter I perceiveFast lock'd in mine, with pleasure such as loveConfirm'd by long experience of thy worth
And well-tried virtues could alone inspire—Witness a joy that thou hast doubled long.Thou know'st my praise of nature most sincere,And that my raptures are not conjured upTo serve occasions of poetic pomp,But genuine, and art partner of them all.How oft upon yon eminence, our paceHas slacken'd to a pause, and we have borneThe ruffling wind scarce conscious that it blew,While admiration feeding at the eye,And still unsated, dwelt upon the scene.Thence with what pleasure have we just discern'dThe distant plough slow-moving, and besideHis lab'ring team that swerv'd not from the track,The sturdy swain diminish'd to a boy!Here Ouse, slow winding through a level plainOf spacious meads with cattle sprinkled o'er,Conducts the eye along his sinuous courseDelighted. There, fast rooted in his bankStand, never overlook'd, our fav'rite elms
That screen the herdsman's solitary hut;While far beyond and overthwart the streamThat as with molten glass inlays the vale,The sloping land recedes into the clouds;Displaying on its varied side, the graceOf hedge-row beauties numberless, square tow'r,Tall spire, from which the sound of chearful bellsJust undulates upon the list'ning ear;Groves, heaths, and smoking villages remote.Scenes must be beautiful which daily view'dPlease daily, and whose novelty survivesLong knowledge and the scrutiny of years.Praise justly due to those that I describe.Nor rural sights alone, but rural soundsExhilarate the spirit, and restoreThe tone of languid Nature. Mighty windsThat sweep the skirt of some far-spreading woodOf ancient growth, make music not unlikeThe dash of ocean on his winding shore,
And lull the spirit while they fill the mind,Unnumber'd branches waving in the blast,And all their leaves fast flutt'ring, all at once.Nor less composure waits upon the roarOf distant floods, or on the softer voiceOf neighb'ring fountain, or of rills that slipThrough the cleft rock, and chiming as they fallUpon loose pebbles, lose themselves at lengthIn matted grass, that with a livelier greenBetrays the secret of their silent course.Nature inanimate employs sweet sounds,But animated Nature sweeter stillTo sooth and satisfy the human ear.Ten thousand warblers chear the day, and oneThe live-long night: nor these alone whose notesNice-finger'd art must emulate in vain,But cawing rooks, and kites that swim sublimeIn still repeated circles, screaming loud,The jay, the pie, and ev'n the boding owlThat hails the rising moon, have charms for me.
Sounds inharmonious in themselves and harsh,Yet heard in scenes where peace for ever reigns,And only there, please highly for their sake.Peace to the artist, whose ingenious thoughtDevised the weather-house, that useful toy!Fearless of humid air and gathering rainsForth steps the man, an emblem of myself,More delicate his tim'rous mate retires.When Winter soaks the fields, and female feetToo weak to struggle with tenacious clay,Or ford the rivulets, are best at home,The task of new discov'ries falls on me.At such a season and with such a chargeOnce went I forth, and found, till then unknown,A cottage, whither oft we since repair:'Tis perch'd upon the green-hill top, but closeInviron'd with a ring of branching elmsThat overhang the thatch, itself unseen,Peeps at the vale below; so thick beset
With foliage of such dark redundant growth,I call'd the low-roof'd lodge the peasant's nest.And hidden as it is, and far remoteFrom such unpleasing sounds as haunt the earIn village or in town, the bay of cursIncessant, clinking hammers, grinding wheels,And infants clam'rous whether pleas'd or pain'd,Oft have I wish'd the peaceful covert mine.Here, I have said, at least I should possessThe poet's treasure, silence, and indulgeThe dreams of fancy, tranquil and secure.Vain thought! the dweller in that still retreatDearly obtains the refuge it affords.Its elevated scite forbids the wretchYo drink sweet waters of the chrystal well;He dips his bowl into the weedy ditch,And heavy-laden brings his bev'rage homeFar-fetch'd and little worth; nor seldom waits,Dependent on the baker's punctual call,To hear his creaking panniers at the door,
Angry and sad and his last crust consumed.So farewel envy of the peasant's nest.If solitude make scant the means of life,Society for me! thou seeming sweet,Be still a pleasing object in my view,My visit still, but never mine abode.Not distant far, a length of colonadeInvites us. Monument of ancient taste,Now scorn'd, but worthy of a better fate.Our fathers knew the value of a screenFrom sultry suns, and in their shaded walksAnd long-protracted bow'rs, enjoy'd at noonThe gloom and coolness of declining day.We bear our shades about us; self depriv'dOf other screen, the thin umbrella spread,And range an Indian waste without a tree.Thanks to John Courtney Throckmorton, Esq. of Weston Underwood. Benevolus—he spares me yet
These chesnuts ranged in corresponding lines,And though himself so polish'd, still reprievesThe obsolete prolixity of shade.Descending now (but cautious, lest too fast)A sudden steep, upon a rustic bridgeWe pass a gulph in which the willows dipTheir pendent boughs, stooping as if to drink.Hence ancle deep in moss and flow'ry thymeWe mount again, and feel at ev'ry stepOur foot half sunk in hillocks green and soft,Rais'd by the mole, the miner of the soil.He not unlike the great ones of mankind,Disfigures earth, and plotting in the darkToils much to earn a monumental pile,That may record the mischiefs he has done.The summit gain'd, behold the proud alcoveThat crowns it! yet not all its pride securesThe grand retreat from injuries impress'd
By rural carvers, who with knives defaceThe pannels, leaving an obscure rude nameIn characters uncouth, and spelt amiss.So strong the zeal t' immortalize himselfBeats in the breast of man, that ev'n a fewFew transient years won from th' abyss abhorr'dOf blank oblivion, seem a glorious prize,And even to a clown. Now roves the eye,And posted on this speculative heightExults in its command. The sheep-fold herePours out its fleecy tenants o'er the glebe.At first, progressive as a stream, they seekThe middle field; but scatter'd by degreesEach to his choice, soon whiten all the land.There, from the sun-burnt hay-field homeward creepsThe loaded wain, while lighten'd of its chargeThe wain that meets it, passes swiftly by,The boorish driver leaning o'er his teamVocif'rous, and impatient of delay.Nor less attractive is the woodland scene
Diversified with trees of ev'ry growthAlike yet various. Here the grey smooth trunksOf ash or lime, or beech, distinctly shine,Within the twilight of their distant shades;There lost behind a rising ground, the woodSeems sunk, and shorten'd to its topmost boughs.No tree in all the grove but has its charms,Though each its hue peculiar; paler some,And of a wannish grey; the willow suchAnd poplar, that with silver lines his leaf,And ash far-stretching his umbrageous arm.Of deeper green the elm; and deeper still,Lord of the woods, the long-surviving oak.Some glossy-leav'd and shining in the sun,The maple, and the beech of oily nutsProlific, and the lime at dewy eveDiffusing odors: nor unnoted passThe sycamore, capricious in attire,Now green, now tawny, and 'ere autumn yetHave changed the woods, in scarlet honors bright.
O'er these, but far beyond, (a spacious mapOf hill and valley interpos'd between)The Ouse, dividing the well water'd land,Now glitters in the sun, and now retires,As bashful, yet impatient to be seen.Hence the declivity is sharp and short,And such the re-ascent; between them weepsA little Naiad her impov'rish'd urnAll summer long, which winter fills again.The folded gates would bar my progress now,But that the See the foregoing note. Lord of this inclosed demesne,Communicative of the good he owns,Admits me to a share: the guiltless eyeCommits no wrong, nor wastes what it enjoys.Refreshing change! where now the blazing sun?By short transition we have lost his glareAnd stepp'd at once into a cooler clime.Ye fallen avenues! once more I mourn
Your fate unmerited, once more rejoiceThat yet a remnant of your race survives.How airy and how light the graceful arch,Yet awful as the consecrated roofRe-echoing pious anthems! while beneathThe chequer'd earth seems restless as a floodBrush'd by the wind. So sportive is the lightShot through the boughs, it dances as they dance,Shadow and sunshine intermingling quick,And darkning and enlightning, as the leavesPlay wanton, ev'ry moment, ev'ry spot.And now with nerves new-brac'd and spirits chear'dWe tread the wilderness, whose well-roll'd walksWith curvature of slow and easy sweep,Deception innocent—give ample spaceTo narrow bounds. The grove receives us next;Between the upright shafts of whose tall elmsWe may discern the thresher at his task.Thump after thump, resounds the constant flail,
That seems to swing uncertain, and yet fallsFull on the destin'd ear. Wide flies the chaff,The rustling straw sends up a frequent mistOf atoms sparkling in the noon-day beam.Come hither, ye that press your beds of downAnd sleep not: see him sweating o'er his breadBefore he eats it.—'Tis the primal curse,But soften'd into mercy; made the pledgeOf chearful days, and nights without a groan.By ceaseless action, all that is, subsists.Constant rotation of th' unwearied wheelThat nature rides upon, maintains her health,Her beauty, her fertility. She dreadsAn instant's pause, and lives but while she moves.Its own revolvency upholds the world.Winds from all quarters agitate the air,And fit the limpid element for use,Else noxious: oceans, rivers, lakes, and streamsAll feel the fresh'ning impulse, and are cleansed
By restless undulation; ev'n the oakThrives by the rude concussion of the storm;He seems indeed indignant, and to feelTh' impression of the blast with proud disdain,Frowning as if in his unconscious armHe held the thunder. But the monarch owesHis firm stability to what he scorns,More fixt below, the more disturb'd above.The law by which all creatures else are bound,Binds man the lord of all. Himself derivesNo mean advantage from a kindred cause,From strenuous toil his hours of sweetest ease.The sedentary stretch their lazy lengthWhen custom bids, but no refreshment find,For none they need: the languid eye, the cheekDeserted of its bloom, the flaccid, shrunk,And wither'd muscle, and the vapid soul,Reproach their owner with that love of restTo which he forfeits ev'n the rest he loves.Not such th' alert and active. Measure life
By its true worth, the comforts it affords,And theirs alone seems worthy of the name.Good health, and its associate in the most,Good temper; spirits prompt to undertake,And not soon spent, though in an arduous task;The pow'rs of fancy and strong thought are theirs;Ev'n age itself seems privileged in themWith clear exemption from its own defects.A sparkling eye beneath a wrinkled frontThe vet'ran shows, and gracing a grey beardWith youthful smiles, descends toward the graveSprightly, and old almost without decay.Like a coy maiden, ease, when courted most,Farthest retires—an idol, at whose shrineWho oft'nest sacrifice are favor'd least.The love of Nature, and the scenes she drawsIs Nature's dictate. Strange! there should be foundWho self-imprison'd in their proud saloons,Renounce the odors of the open field
For the unscented fictions of the loom.Who satisfied with only pencil'd scenes,Prefer to the performance of a GodTh' inferior wonders of an artist's hand.Lovely indeed the mimic works of art,But Nature's works far lovelier. I admire—None more admires the painter's magic skill,Who shews me that which I shall never see,Conveys a distant country into mine,And throws Italian light on English walls.But imitative strokes can do no moreThan please the eye, sweet Nature ev'ry sense.The air salubrious of her lofty hills,The chearing fragrance of her dewy valesAnd music of her woods—no works of manMay rival these; these all bespeak a powerPeculiar, and exclusively her own.Beneath the open sky she spreads the feast;'Tis free to all—'tis ev'ry day renew'd,Who scorns it, starves deservedly at home.
He does not scorn it, who imprison'd longIn some unwholesome dungeon, and a preyTo sallow sickness, which the vapors dankAnd clammy of his dark abode have bred,Escapes at last to liberty and light.His cheek recovers soon its healthful hue,His eye relumines its extinguish'd fires,He walks, he leaps, he runs—is wing'd with joy,And riots in the sweets of ev'ry breeze.He does not scorn it, who has long endur'dA fever's agonies, and fed on drugs.Nor yet the mariner, his blood inflamedWith acrid salts; his very heart athirstTo gaze at Nature in her green array.Upon the ship's tall side he stands, possess'dWith visions prompted by intense desire;Fair fields appear below, such as he leftFar distant, such as he would die to find—He seeks them headlong, and is seen no more.The spleen is seldom felt where Flora reigns;The low'ring eye, the petulance, the frown,And sullen sadness that o'ershade, distort,And mar the face of beauty, when no causeFor such immeasurable woe appears,These Flora banishes, and gives the fairSweet smiles and bloom less transient than her own.It is the constant revolution staleAnd tasteless, of the same repeated joys,That palls and satiates, and makes languid lifeA pedlar's pack, that bows the bearer down.Health suffers, and the spirits ebb; the heartRecoils from its own choice—at the full feastIs famish'd—finds no music in the song,No smartness in the jest, and wonders why.Yet thousands still desire to journey on,Though halt and weary of the path they tread.The paralitic who can hold her cardsBut cannot play them, borrows a friend's handTo deal and shuffle, to divide and sort
Her mingled suits and sequences, and sitsSpectatress both and spectacle, a sadAnd silent cypher, while her proxy plays.Others are dragg'd into the crowded roomBetween supporters; and once seated, sitThrough downright inability to rise,'Till the stout bearers lift the corpse again.These speak a loud memento. Yet ev'n theseThemselves love life, and cling to it, as heThat overhangs a torrent, to a twig.They love it, and yet loath it; fear to die,Yet scorn the purposes for which they live.Then wherefore not renounce them? No—the dread,The slavish dread of solitude, that breedsReflection and remorse, the fear of shame,And their invet'rate habits, all forbid.Whom call we gay? That honor has been longThe boast of mere pretenders to the name.The innocent are gay—the lark is gay
That dries his feathers saturate with dewBeneath the rosy cloud, while yet the beamsOf day-spring overshoot his humble nest.The peasant too, a witness of his song,Himself a songster, is as gay as he.But save me from the gaiety of thoseWhose head-aches nail them to a noon-day bed;And save me too from theirs whose haggard eyesFlash desperation, and betray their pangsFor property stripp'd off by cruel chance;From gaiety that fills the bones with pain,The mouth with blasphemy, the heart with woe.The earth was made so various, that the mindOf desultory man, studious of change,And pleas'd with novelty, might be indulged.Prospects however lovely may be seen'Till half their beauties fade; the weary sight,Too well acquainted with their smiles, slides offFastidious, seeking less familiar scenes.
Then snug inclosures in the shelter'd vale,Where frequent hedges intercept the eye,Delight us, happy to renounce a while,Not senseless of its charms, what still we love,That such short absence may endear it more.Then forests, or the savage rock may please,That hides the sea-mew in his hollow cleftsAbove the reach of man: his hoary headConspicuous many a league, the marinerBound homeward, and in hope already there,Greets with three cheers exulting. At his waistA girdle of half-wither'd shrubs he shows,And at his feet the baffled billows die.The common overgrown with fern, and roughWith prickly goss, that shapeless and deformAnd dang'rous to the touch, has yet its bloomAnd decks itself with ornaments of gold,Yields no unpleasing ramble; there the turfSmells fresh, and rich in odorif'rous herbs
And fungous fruits of earth, regales the senseWith luxury of unexpected sweets.There often wanders one, whom better daysSaw better clad, in cloak of sattin trimm'dWith lace, and hat with splendid ribband bound.A serving maid was she, and fell in loveWith one who left her, went to sea and died.Her fancy followed him through foaming wavesTo distant shores, and she would sit and weepAt what a sailor suffers; fancy tooDelusive most where warmest wishes are,Would oft anticipate his glad return,And dream of transports she was not to know.She heard the doleful tidings of his death,And never smil'd again. And now she roamsThe dreary waste; there spends the livelong day,And there, unless when charity forbids,The livelong night. A tatter'd apron hides,Worn as a cloak, and hardly hides a gown
More tatter'd still; and both but ill concealA bosom heaved with never-ceasing sighs.She begs an idle pin of all she meets,And hoards them in her sleeve; but needful food,Though press'd with hunger oft, or comelier cloaths,Though pinch'd with cold, asks never.—Kate is craz'd.I see a column of slow-rising smokeO'ertop the lofty wood that skirts the wild.A vagabond and useless tribe there eatTheir miserable meal. A kettle slungBetween two poles upon a stick transverse,Receives the morsel; flesh obscene of dog,Or vermin, or at best, of cock purloin'dFrom his accustom'd perch. Hard-faring race!They pick their fuel out of ev'ry hedge,Which kindled with dry leaves, just saves unquench'dThe spark of life. The sportive wind blows wideTheir flutt'ring rags, and shows a tawny skin,The vellum of the pedigree they claim.
Great skill have they in palmistry, and moreTo conjure clean away the gold they touch,Conveying worthless dross into its place.Loud when they beg, dumb only when they steal.Strange! that a creature rational, and castIn human mould, should brutalize by choiceHis nature, and though capable of artsBy which the world might profit and himself,Self-banish'd from fociety, preferSuch squalid sloth to honorable toil.Yet even these, though feigning sickness oftThey swathe the forehead, drag the limping limbAnd vex their flesh with artificial sores,Can change their whine into a mirthful noteWhen safe occasion offers, and with danceAnd music of the bladder and the bagBeguile their woes and make the woods resound.Such health and gaiety of heart enjoyThe houseless rovers of the sylvan world;And breathing wholesome air, and wand'ring much,
Need other physic none to heal th' effectsOf loathfome diet, penury, and cold.Blest he, though undistinguish'd from the crowdBy wealth or dignity, who dwells secureWhere man, by nature fierce, has laid asideHis fierceness, having learnt, though slow to learn,The manners and the arts of civil life.His wants, indeed, are many; but supplyIs obvious; placed within the easy reachOf temp'rate wishes and industrious hands.Here virtue thrives as in her proper soil;Not rude and surly, and beset with thorns,And terrible to sight, as when she springs,(If e'er she spring spontaneous) in remoteAnd barb'rous climes, where violence prevails,And strength is lord of all; but gentle, kind,By culture tam'd, by liberty refresh'd,And all her fruits by radiant truth matur'd.War and the chace engross the savage whole.
War follow'd for revenge, or to supplantThe envied tenants of some happier spot,The chace for sustenance, precarious trust!His hard condition with severe constraintBinds all his faculties, forbids all growthOf wisdom, proves a school in which he learnsSly circumvention, unrelenting hate,Mean self-attachment, and scarce aught beside.Thus fare the shiv'ring natives of the north,And thus the rangers of the western worldWhere it advances far into the deep,Towards th' Antarctic. Ev'n the favor'd islesSo lately found, although the constant sunCheer all their seasons with a grateful smile,Can boast but little virtue; and inertThrough plenty, lose in morals, what they gainIn manners, victims of luxurious ease.These therefore I can pity, placed remoteFrom all that science traces, art invents,Or inspiration teaches; and inclosed
In boundless oceans never to be pass'dBy navigators uninformed as they,Or plough'd perhaps by British bark again.But far beyond the rest, and with most causeThee, gentle Omia. savage! whom no love of theeOr thine, but curiosity perhaps,Or else vain glory, prompted us to drawForth from thy native bow'rs, to show thee hereWith what superior skill we can abuseThe gifts of providence, and squander life.The dream is past. And thou hast found againThy cocoas and bananas, palms and yams,And homestall thatch'd with leaves. But hast thou foundTheir former charms? And having seen our state,Our palaces, our ladies, and our pompOf equipage, our gardens, and our sports,And heard our music; are thy simple friends,Thy simple fare, and all thy plain delightsAs dear to thee as once? And have thy joysLost nothing by comparison with ours?
Rude as thou art (for we return'd thee rudeAnd ignorant, except of outward show)I cannot think thee yet so dull of heartAnd spiritless, as never to regretSweets tasted here, and left as soon as known.Methinks I see thee straying on the beach,And asking of the surge that bathes thy footIf ever it has wash'd our distant shore.I see thee weep, and thine are honest tears,A patriot's for his country. Thou art sadAt thought of her forlorn and abject state,From which no power of thine can raise her up.Thus fancy paints thee, and though apt to err,Perhaps errs little, when she paints thee thus.She tells me too that duely ev'ry mornThou climb'st the mountain top, with eager eyeExploring far and wide the wat'ry wasteFor sight of ship from England. Ev'ry speckSeen in the dim horizon, turns thee paleWith conflict of contending hopes and fears.
But comes at last the dull and dusky eve,And sends thee to thy cabbin, well-prepar'dTo dream all night of what the day denied.Alas! expect it not. We found no baitTo tempt us in thy country. Doing good,Disinterested good, is not our trade.We travel far 'tis true, but not for nought;And must be brib'd to compass earth againBy other hopes and richer fruits than yours.But though true worth and virtue, in the mildAnd genial soil of cultivated lifeThrive most, and may perhaps thrive only there,Yet not in cities oft. In proud and gayAnd gain devoted cities; thither flow,As to a common and most noisome sewer,The dregs and faeculence of ev'ry land.In cities foul example on most mindsBegets its likeness. Rank abundance breedsIn gross and pamper'd cities sloth and lust,
And wantonness and gluttonous excess.In cities, vice is hidden with most ease,Or seen with least reproach; and virtue taughtBy frequent lapse, can hope no triumph thereBeyond th' atchievement of successful flight.I do confess them nurs'ries of the arts,In which they flourish most. Where in the beamsOf warm encouragement, and in the eyeOf public note they reach their perfect size.Such London is, by taste and wealth proclaim'dThe fairest capital of all the world,By riot and incontinence the worst.There, touch'd by Reynolds, a dull blank becomesA lucid mirror, in which nature seesAll her reflected features. Bacon thereGives more than female beauty to a stone,And Chatham's eloquence to marble lips.Nor does the chissel occupy aloneThe pow'rs of sculpture, but the style as much;Each province of her art her equal care.
With nice incision of her guided steelShe ploughs a brazen field, and clothes a soilSo sterile with what charms soe'er she will,The richest scen'ry and the loveliest forms.Where finds philosophy her eagle eyeWith which she gazes at yon burning diskUndazzled, and detects and counts his spots?In London; where her implements exactWith which she calculates computes and scansAll distance, motion, magnitude, and nowMeasures an atom, and now girds a world?In London; where has commerce such a mart,So rich, so throng'd, so drain'd, and so suppliedAs London, opulent, enlarged, and stillIncreasing London? Babylon of oldNot more the glory of the earth, than sheA more accomplish'd world's chief glory now.She has her praise. Now mark a spot or twoThat so much beauty would do well to purge;
And show this queen of cities, that so fairMay yet be foul, so witty, yet not wise.It is not seemly, nor of good reportThat she is slack in discipline. More promptT'avenge than to prevent the breach of law.That she is rigid in denouncing deathOn petty robbers, and indulges lifeAnd liberty, and oft-times honor tooTo peculators of the public gold.That thieves at home must hang; but he that putsInto his overgorged and bloated purseThe wealth of Indian provinces, escapes.Nor is it well, nor can it come to good,That through profane and infidel contemptOf holy writ, she has presum'd t'annulAnd abrogate, as roundly as she may,The total ordonance and will of God;Advancing fashion to the post of truth,And cent'ring all authority in modesAnd customs of her own, till sabbath rites
Have dwindled into unrespected forms,And knees and hassocks are well-nigh divorced.God made the country, and man made the town.What wonder then, that health and virtue, giftsThat can alone make sweet the bitter draughtThat life holds out to all, should most aboundAnd least be threatened in the fields and groves?Possess ye therefore, ye who borne aboutIn chariots and sedans, know no fatigueBut that of idleness, and taste no scenesBut such as art contrives, possess ye stillYour element; there only, ye can shine,There only minds like yours can do no harm.Our groves were planted to console at noonThe pensive wand'rer in their shades. At eveThe moon-beam sliding softly in betweenThe sleeping leaves, is all the light they wish,Birds warbling all the music. We can spareThe splendor of your lamps, they but eclipse
Our softer satellite. Your songs confoundOur more harmonious notes. The thrush departsScared, and th' offended nightingale is mute.There is a public mischief in your mirth,It plagues your country. Folly such as your'sGraced with a sword, and worthier of a fan,Has made, which enemies could ne'er have done,Our arch of empire, stedfast but for you,A mutilated structure, soon to fall.ARGUMENT of the SECOND BOOK.Which opens with reflections suggested by the conclusion of

My ear is pain'd,My soul is sick with ev'ry day's reportOf wrong and outrage with which earth is fill'd.There is no flesh in man's obdurate heart,It does not feel for man. The nat'ral bondOf brotherhood is sever'd as the flaxThat falls asunder at the touch of fire.
He finds his fellow guilty of a skinNot colour'd like his own, and having pow'rT' inforce the wrong, sor such a worthy causeDooms and devotes him as his lawful prey.Lands intersected by a narrow frithAbhor each other. Mountains interposed,Make enemies of nations who had elseLike kindred drops been mingled into one.Thus man devotes his brother, and destroys;And worse than all, and most to be deploredAs human nature's broadest, foulest blot,Chains him, and tasks him, and exacts his sweatWith stripes, that mercy with a bleeding heartWeeps when she sees inflicted on a beast.Then what is man? And what man seeing this,And having human feelings, does not blushAnd hang his head, to think himself a man?I would not have a slave to till my ground,To carry me, to fan me while I sleep,And tremble when I wake, for all the wealthThat sinews bought and sold have ever earn'd.
No: dear as freedom is, and in my heart'sJust estimation priz'd above all price,I had much rather be myself the slaveAnd wear the bonds, than fasten them on him.We have no slaves at home.—Then why abroad?And they themselves once ferried o'er the waveThat parts us, are emancipate and loos'd.Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungsReceive our air, that moment they are free,They touch our country and their shackles fall.That's noble, and bespeaks a nation proudAnd jealous of the blessing. Spread it then,And let it circulate through ev'ry veinOf all your empire. That where Britain's powerIs felt, mankind may feel her mercy too.Sure there is need of social intercourse,Benevolence and peace and mutual aidBetween the nations, in a world that seemsTo toll the death-bell of its own decease,
And by the voice of all its elementsTo preach the gen'ral doom.Alluding to the late calamities at Jamaica. When were the windsLet slip with such a warrant to destroy,When did the waves so haughtily o'erleapTheir ancient barriers, deluging the dry?Fires from beneath, and meteors August 18, 1783. from abovePortentous, unexampled, unexplained,Have kindled beacons in the skies, and th' oldAnd crazy earth has had her shaking fitsMore frequent, and foregone her usual rest.Is it a time to wrangle, when the propsAnd pillars of our planet seem to fail,And Nature Alluding to the fog that covered both Europe and Asia during the whole summer of 1783. with a dim and sickly eyeTo wait the close of all? But grant her endMore distant, and that prophecy demandsA longer respite, unaccomplished yet;
Still they are frowning signals, and bespeakDispleasure in his breast who smites the earthOr heals it, makes it languish or rejoice.And 'tis but seemly, that where all deserveAnd stand exposed by common peccancyTo what no few have felt, there should be peace,And brethren in calamity should love.Alas for Sicily! rude fragments nowLie scatter'd where the shapely column stood.Her palaces are dust. In all her streetsThe voice of singing and the sprightly chordAre silent. Revelry and dance and showSuffer a syncope and solemn pause,While God performs upon the trembling stageOf his own works, his dreadful part alone.How does the earth receive him?—With what signsOf gratulation and delight, her king?Pours she not all her choicest fruits abroad,Her sweetest flow'rs, her aromatic gums,
Disclosing paradise where'er he treads?She quakes at his approach. Her hollow wombConceiving thunders, through a thousand deepsAnd fiery caverns roars beneath his foot.The hills move lightly and the mountains smoke,For he has touch'd them. From th' extremest pointOf elevation down into th' abyss,His wrath is busy and his frown is felt.The rocks fall headlong and the vallies rise,The rivers die into offensive pools,And charged with putrid verdure, breathe a grossAnd mortal nuisance into all the air.What solid was, by transformation strangeGrows fluid, and the fixt and rooted earthTormented into billows heaves and swells,Or with vortiginous and hideous whirlSucks down its prey insatiable. ImmenseThe tumult and the overthrow, the pangsAnd agonies of human and of bruteMultitudes, fugitive on ev'ry side,
And fugitive in vain. The sylvan sceneMigrates uplifted, and with all its soilAlighting in far distant fields, finds outA new possessor, and survives the change.Ocean has caught the frenzy, and upwroughtTo an enormous and o'erbearing height,Not by a mighty wind, but by that voiceWhich winds and waves obey, invades the shoreResistless. Never such a sudden flood,Upridged so high, and sent on such a charge,Possess'd an inland scene. Where now the throngThat press'd the beach and hasty to departLook'd to the sea for safety? They are gone,Gone with the refluent wave into the deep,A prince with half his people. Ancient tow'rs,And roofs embattled high, the gloomy scenesWhere beauty oft and letter'd worth consumeLife in the unproductive shades of death,Fall prone; the pale inhabitants come forth,And happy in their unforeseen release
From all the rigors of restraint, enjoyThe terrors of the day that sets them free.Who then that has thee, would not hold thee fastFreedom! whom they that lose thee, so regret,That ev'n a judgment making way for thee,Seems in their eyes, a mercy, for thy sake.Such evil sin hath wrought; and such a flameKindled in heaven, that it burns down to earth,And in the furious inquest that it makesOn God's behalf, lays waste his fairest works.The very elements, though each be meantThe minister of man, to serve his wants,Conspire against him. With his breath, he drawsA plague into his blood. And cannot useLife's necessary means, but he must die.Storms rise t' o'erwhelm him: or if stormy windsRise not, the waters of the deep shall rise,And needing none assistance of the storm,Shall roll themselves ashore, and reach him there.
The earth shall shake him out of all his holds,Or make his house his grave. Nor so content,Shall counterfeit the motions of the flood,And drown him in her dry and dusty gulphs.What then—were they the wicked above all,And we the righteous, whose fast-anchor'd isleMoved not, while their's was rock'd like a light skiff,The sport of ev'ry wave? No: none are clear,And none than we more guilty. But where allStand chargeable with guilt, and to the shaftsOf wrath obnoxious, God may chuse his mark.May punish, if he please, the less, to warnThe more malignant. If he spar'd not them,Tremble and be amazed at thine escapeFar guiltier England, lest he spare not thee.Happy the man who sees a God employedIn all the good and ill that checquer life!Resolving all events with their effectsAnd manifold results, into the will
And arbitration wise of the Supreme.Did not his eye rule all things, and intendThe least of our concerns (since from the leastThe greatest oft originate) could chanceFind place in his dominion, or disposeOne lawless particle to thwart his plan,Then God might be surprized, and unforeseenContingence might alarm him, and disturbThe smooth and equal course of his affairs.This truth, philosophy, though eagle-eyedIn nature's tendencies, oft overlooks,And having found his instrument, forgetsOr disregards, or more presumptuous stillDenies the pow'r that wields it. God proclaimsHis hot displeasure against foolish menThat live an atheist life. Involves the heav'nIn tempests, quits his grasp upon the windsAnd gives them all their fury. Bids a plagueKindle a fiery boil upon the skin,And putrify the breath of blooming health.
He calls for famine, and the meagre fiendBlows mildew from between his shrivel'd lips,And taints the golden ear. He springs his mines,And desolates a nation at a blast.Forth steps the spruce philosopher, and tellsOf homogeneal and discordant springsAnd principles; of causes how they workBy necessary laws their sure effects,Of action and re-action. He has foundThe source of the disease that nature feels,And bids the world take heart and banish fear.Thou fool! will thy discov'ry of the causeSuspend th' effect or heal it? Has not GodStill wrought by means since first he made the world,And did he not of old employ his meansTo drown it? What is his creation lessThan a capacious reservoir of meansForm'd for his use, and ready at his will?Go, dress thine eyes with eye-salve, ask of him,
Or ask of whomsoever he has taught,And learn, though late, the genuine cause of all.England, with all thy faults, I love thee stillMy country! and while yet a nook is leftWhere English minds and manners may be found,Shall be constrain'd to love thee. Though thy climeBe fickle, and thy year, most part, deform'dWith dripping rains, or wither'd by a frost,I would not yet exchange thy sullen skiesAnd fields without a flower, for warmer FranceWith all her vines; nor for Ausonias grovesOf golden fruitage and her myrtle bow'rs.To shake thy senate, and from heights sublimeOf patriot eloquence to flash down fireUpon thy foes, was never meant my task;But I can feel thy fortunes, and partakeThy joys and sorrows with as true a heartAs any thund'rer there. And I can feelThy follies too, and with a just disdain
Frown at effeminates, whose very looksReflect dishonor on the land I love.How, in the name of soldiership and sense,Should England prosper, when such things, as smoothAnd tender as a girl, all essenced o'erWith odors, and as profligate as sweet,Who sell their laurel for a myrtle wreath,And love when they should fight; when such as thesePresume to lay their hand upon the arkOf her magnificent and awful cause?Time was when it was praise and boast enoughIn ev'ry clime, and travel where we might,That we were born her children. Praise enoughTo fill th' ambition of a private man,That Chatham's language was his mother tongue,And Wolfe's great name compatriot with his own.Farewell those honors, and farewell with themThe hope of such hereafter. They have fall'nEach in his field of glory: One in arms,And one in council. Wolfe upon the lap
Of smiling victory that moment won,And Chatham, heart-sick of his country's shame.They made us many soldiers. Chatham stillConsulting England's happiness at home,Secured it by an unforgiving frownIf any wrong'd her. Wolf, where'er he fought,Put so much of his heart into his act,That his example had a magnet's force,And all were swift to follow whom all loved.Those suns are set. Oh rise some other such!Or all that we have left, is empty talkOf old atchievements, and despair of new.Now hoist the sail, and let the streamers floatUpon the wanton breezes. Strew the deckWith lavender, and sprinkle liquid sweets,That no rude savour maritime invadeThe nose of nice nobility. Breathe softYe clarionets, and softer still ye flutes,That winds and waters lull'd by magic sounds
May bear us smoothly to the Gallic shore.True, we have lost an empire—let it pass.True, we may thank the perfidy of FranceThat pick'd the jewel out of England's crown,With all the cunning of an envious shrew.And let that pass—'twas but a trick of state.A brave man knows no malice, but at onceForgets in peace, the injuries of war,And gives his direst foe a friend's embrace.And shamed as we have been, to th' very beardBraved and defied, and in our own sea provedToo weak for those decisive blows, that onceInsured us mast'ry there, we yet retainSome small pre-eminence, we justly boastAt least superior jockeyship, and claimThe honors of the turf as all our own.Go then, well worthy of the praise ye seek,And show the shame ye might conceal at home,In foreign eyes!—be grooms, and win the plate,Where once your nobler fathers won a crown!—
'Tis gen'rous to communicate your skillTo those that need it. Folly is soon learn'd.And under such preceptors, who can fail.There is a pleasure in poetic painsWhich only poets know. The shifts and turns,Th' expedients and inventions multiformTo which the mind resorts, in chace of termsThough apt, yet coy, and difficult to win—T' arrest the fleeting images that fillThe mirror of the mind, and hold them fast,And force them sit, 'till he has pencil'd offA faithful likeness of the forms he views;Then to dispofe his copies with such artThat each may find its most propitious light,And shine by situation, hardly less,Than by the labor and the skill it cost,Are occupations of the poet's mindSo pleasing, and that steal away the thoughtWith such address, from themes of sad import,
That lost in his own musings, happy man!He feels th' anxieties of life, deniedTheir wonted entertainment, all retire.Such joys has he that sings. But ah! not such,Or seldom such, the hearers of his song.Fastidious, or else listless, or perhapsAware of nothing arduous in a taskThey never undertook, they little noteHis dangers or escapes, and haply findThere least amusement where he found the most.But is amusement all? studious of song,And yet ambitious not to sing in vain,I would not trifle merely, though the worldBe loudest in their praise who do no more.Yet what can satire, whether grave or gay?It may correct a foible, may chastiseThe freaks of fashion, regulate the dress,Retrench a sword-blade, or displace a patch;But where are its sublimer trophies found?What vice has it subdued? whose heart reclaim'd
By rigour, or whom laugh'd into reform?Alas! Leviathan is not so tamed.Laugh'd at, he laughs again; and stricken hard,Turns to the stroke his adamantine scales,That fear no discipline of human hands.The pulpit therefore (and I name it, fill'dWith solemn awe, that bids me well bewareWith what intent I touch that holy thing)The pulpit (when the sat'rist has at last,Strutting and vap'ring in an empty school,Spent all his force and made no proselyte)I say the pulpit (in the sober useOf its legitimate peculiar pow'rs)Must stand acknowledg'd, while the world shall stand,The most important and effectual guard,Support and ornament of virtue's cause.There stands the messenger of truth. There standsThe legate of the skies. His theme divine,His office sacred, his credentials clear.
By him, the violated law speaks outIts thunders, and by him, in strains as sweetAs angels use, the gospel whispers peace.He stablishes the strong, restores the weak,Reclaims the wand'rer, binds the broken heart,And arm'd himself in panoply completeOf heav'nly temper, furnishes with armsBright as his own, and trains by ev'ry ruleOf holy discipline, to glorious war,The sacramental host of God's elect.Are all such teachers? would to heav'n all were!But hark—the Doctor's voice—fast wedg'd betweenTwo empirics he stands, and with swoln cheeksInspires the news, his trumpet. Keener farThan all invective is his bold harrangue,While through that public organ of reportHe hails the clergy; and defying shame,Announces to the world his own and theirs.He teaches those to read, whom schools dismiss'd,And colleges untaught; sells accent, tone,
And emphasis in score, and gives to pray'rTh' adagio and andante it demands.He grinds divinity of other daysDown into modern use; transforms old printTo zig-zag manuscript, and cheats the eyesOf gall'ry critics by a thousand arts.—Are there who purchase of the Doctor's ware!Oh name it not in Gath!—it cannot be,That grave and learned Clerks should need such aid.He doubtless is in sport, and does but droll,Assuming thus a rank unknown before,Grand caterer and dry-nurse of the church.I venerate the man, whose heart is warm,Whose hands are pure, whose doctrine and whose lifeCoincident, exhibit lucid proofThat he is honest in the sacred cause.To such I render more than mere respect,Whose actions say that they respect themselves.But loose in morals, and in manners vain,
In conversation frivolous, in dressExtreme, at once rapacious and profuse,Frequent in park, with lady at his side,Ambling and prattling scandal as he goes,But rare at home, and never at his booksOr with his pen, save when he scrawls a card;Constant at routs, familiar with a roundOf ladyships, a stranger to the poor;Ambitious of preferment for its gold,And well prepared by ignorance and sloth,By infidelity and love o' th' worldTo make God's work a sinecure; a slaveTo his own pleasures and his patron's pride.—From such apostles, Oh ye mitred headsPreserve the church! and lay not careless handsOn sculls that cannot teach, and will not learn.Would I describe a preacher, such as PaulWere he on earth, would hear, approve, and own,Paul should himself direct me. I would trace
His master-strokes, and draw from his design.I would express him simple, grave, sincere;In doctrine uncorrupt; in language plain;And plain in manner. Decent, solemn, chaste,And natural in gesture. Much impress'dHimself, as conscious of his awful charge,And anxious mainly that the flock he feedsMay feel it too. Affectionate in look,And tender in address, as well becomesA messenger of grace to guilty men.Behold the picture!—Is it like?—Like whom?The things that mount the rostrum with a skipAnd then skip down again. Pronounce a text,Cry, hem; and reading what they never wroteJust fifteen minutes, huddle up their work,And with a well bred whisper close the scene.In man or woman, but far most in man,And most of all in man that ministersAnd serves the altar, in my soul I loath
All affectation. 'Tis my perfect scorn;Object of my implacable disgust.What!—will a man play tricks; will he indulgeA silly fond conceit of his fair formAnd just proportion, fashionable mienAnd pretty face in presence of his God?Or will he seek to dazzle me with tropes,As with the di'mond on his lily hand,And play his brilliant parts before my eyesWhen I am hungry for the bread of life?He mocks his Maker, prostitutes and shamesHis noble office, and instead of truthDisplaying his own beauty, starves his flock.Therefore avaunt! all attitude and stareAnd start theatric, practised at the glass.I seek divine simplicity in himWho handles things divine; and all beside,Though learn'd with labor, and though much admir'dBy curious eyes and judgments ill-inform'd,To me is odious as the nasal twang
At conventicle heard, where worthy menMisled by custom, strain celestial themesThrough the prest nostril, spectacle-bestrid.Some, decent in demeanor while they preach,That task perform'd, relapse into themselves,And having spoken wisely, at the closeGrow wanton, and give proof to ev'ry eye—Whoe'er was edified, themselves were not.Forth comes the pocket mirror. First we strokeAn eye-brow; next, compose a straggling lock;Then with an air, most gracefully perform'd,Fall back into our seat; extend an armAnd lay it at its ease with gentle care,With handkerchief in hand, depending low.The better hand more busy, gives the noseIts bergamot, or aids th' indebted eyeWith op'ra glass to watch the moving scene,And recognize the slow-retiring fair.Now this is fulsome; and offends me moreThan in a churchman slovenly neglect
And rustic coarseness would. An heav'nly mindMay be indiff'rent to her house of clay,And slight the hovel as beneath her care;But how a body so fantastic, trim,And queint in its deportment and attire,Can lodge an heav'nly mind—demands a doubt.He that negotiates between God and man,As God's ambassador, the grand concernsOf judgment and of mercy, should bewareOf lightness in his speech. 'Tis pitifulTo court a grin, when you should wooe a soul;To break a jest, when pity would inspirePathetic exhortation; and t' addressThe skittish fancy with facetious tales,When sent with God's commission to the heart.So did not Paul. Direct me to a quipOr merry turn in all he ever wrote,And I consent you take it for your text,Your only one, till sides and benches fail.
No: he was serious in a serious cause,And understood too well the weighty termsThat he had ta'en in charge. He would not stoopTo conquer those by jocular exploits,Whom truth and soberness assail'd in vain.Oh, popular applause! what heart of manIs proof against thy sweet seducing charms?The wisest and the best feel urgent needOf all their caution in thy gentlest gales;But swell'd into a gust—who then, alas!With all his canvass set, and inexpertAnd therefore heedless, can withstand thy power?Praise from the rivel'd lips of toothless, baldDecrepitude; and in the looks of leanAnd craving poverty; and in the bowRespectful of the smutch'd artificerIs oft too welcome, and may much disturbThe bias of the purpose. How much morePour'd forth by beauty splendid and polite,
In language soft as adoration breathes?Ah spare your idol! think him human still.Charms he may have, but he has frailties too,Doat not too much, nor spoil what ye admire.All truth is from the sempiternal sourceOf light divine. But Egypt, Greece, and RomeDrew from the stream below. More favor'd weDrink, when we chuse it, at the fountain head.To them it flow'd much mingled and defiledWith hurtful error, prejudice, and dreamsIllusive of philosophy, so call'd,But falsely. Sages after sages stroveIn vain, to filter off a chrystal draughtPure from the lees, which often more enhancedThe thirst than slaked it, and not seldom bredIntoxication and delirium wild.In vain they push'd enquiry to the birthAnd spring-time of the world, ask'd, whence is man?Why form'd at all? And wherefore as he is?
Where must he find his Maker? With what ritesAdore him? Will he hear, accept, and bless?Or does he sit regardless of his works?Has man within him an immortal seed?Or does the tomb take all? If he surviveHis ashes, where? and in what weal or woe?Knots worthy of solution, which aloneA Deity could solve. Their answers vagueAnd all at random, fabulous and dark,Left them as dark themselves. Their rules of lifeDefective and unsanction'd, proved too weakTo bind the roving appetite, and leadBlind nature to a God not yet reveal'd.'Tis Revelation satisfies all doubts,Explains all mysteries, except her own,And so illuminates the path of life,That fools discover it, and stray no more.Now tell me, dignified and sapient sir,My man of morals, nurtur'd in the shades
Of Academus, is this false or true?Is Christ the abler teacher, or the schools?If Christ, then why resort at ev'ry turnTo Athens or to Rome, for wisdom shortOf man's occasions, when in him resideGrace, knowledge, comfort, an unfathom'd store?How oft when Paul has serv'd us with a text,Has Epictetus, Plato, Tully preach'd!Men that if now alive, would sit contentAnd humble learners of a Saviour's worth,Preach it who might. Such was their love of truth,Their thirst of knowledge, and their candour too.And thus it is. The pastor, either vainBy nature, or by flatt'ry made so, taughtTo gaze at his own splendor, and t' exaltAbsurdly, not his office, but himself;Or unenlighten'd, and too proud to learn,Or vicious, and not therefore apt to teach,Perverting often by the stress of lewd
And loose example, whom he should instruct,Exposes and holds up to broad disgraceThe noblest function, and discredits muchThe brightest truths that man has ever seen.For ghostly counsel, if it either fallBelow the exigence, or be not back'dWith show of love, at least with hopeful proofOf some sincerity on the giver's part;Or be dishonor'd in th' exterior formAnd mode of its conveyance, by such tricksAs move derision, or by foppish airsAnd histrionic mumm'ry, that let downThe pulpit to the level of the stage,Drops from the lips a disregarded thing.The weak perhaps are moved, but are not taught;While prejudice in men of stronger mindsTakes deeper root, confirm'd by what they see.A relaxation of religions holdUpon the roving and untutor'd heartSoon follows, and the curb of conscience snapt,
The laity run wild.—But do they now?Note their extravagance, and be convinced.As nations ignorant of God, contriveA wooden one, so we, no longer taughtBy monitors that mother church supplies,Now make our own. Posterity will ask(If e'er posterity see verse of mine)Some fifty or an hundred lustrums hence,What was a monitor in George's days?My very gentle reader, yet unborn,Of whom I needs must augur better things,Since heav'n would sure grow weary of a worldProductive only of a race like us,A monitor is wood. Plank shaven thin.We wear it at our backs. There closely bracedAnd neatly fitted, it compresses hardThe prominent and most unsightly bones,And binds the shoulders flat. We prove its useSov'reign and most effectual to secure
A form not now gymnastic as of yore,From rickets and distortion, else, our lot.But thus admonish'd we can walk erect,One proof at least of manhood; while the friendSticks close, a Mentor worthy of his charge.Our habits costlier than Lucullus wore,And by caprice as multiplied as his,Just please us while the fashion is at full,But change with ev'ry moon. The sycophantThat waits to dress us, arbitrates their date,Surveys his fair reversion with keen eye;Finds one ill made, another obsolete,This fits not nicely, that is ill conceived,And making prize of all that he condemns,With our expenditure defrays his own.Variety's the very spice of lifeThat gives it all its flavor. We have runThrough ev'ry change that fancy at the loomExhausted, has had genius to supply,And studious of mutation still, discard
A real elegance a little usedFor monstrous novelty and strange disguise.We sacrifice to dress, till houshold joysAnd comforts cease. Dress drains our cellar dry,And keeps our larder lean. Puts out our fires,And introduces hunger, frost, and woe,Where peace and hospitality might reign.What man that lives and that knows how to live,Would fail t' exhibit at the public showsA form as splendid as the proudest there,Though appetite raise outcries at the cost?A man o' th' town dines late, but soon enoughWith reasonable forecast and dispatch,T' insure a side-box station at half price.You think perhaps, so delicate his dress,His daily fare as delicate. Alas!He picks clean teeth, and busy as he seemsWith an old tavern quill, is hungry yet.The rout is folly's circle which she drawsWith magic wand. So potent is the spell,
That none decoy'd into that fatal ring,Unless by heaven's peculiar grace, escape.There we grow early grey, but never wise.There form connexions, and acquire no friend.Solicit pleasure hopeless of success;Waste youth in occupations only fitFor second childhood, and devote old ageTo sports which only childhood could excuse.There they are happiest who dissemble bestTheir weariness; and they the most politeWho squander time and treasure with a smileThough at their own destruction. She that asksHer dear five hundred friends, contemns them all,And hates their coming. They, what can they less?Make just reprisals, and with cringe and shrugAnd bow obsequious, hide their hate of her.All catch the frenzy, downward from her GraceWhose flambeaux flash against the morning skies,And gild our chamber cielings as they pass,To her who frugal only that her thrift.
May feed excesses she can ill afford,Is hackney'd home unlacquey'd. Who in hasteAlighting, turns the key in her own door,And at the watchman's lantern borrowing light,Finds a cold bed her only comfort left.Wives beggar husbands, husbands starve their wives,On fortune's velvet altar off'ring upTheir last poor pittance. Fortune most severeOf goddesses yet known, and costlier farThan all that held their routs in heathen heav'n—So fare we in this prison-house the world.And 'tis a fearful spectacle to seeSo many maniacs dancing in their chains.They gaze upon the links that hold them fastWith eyes of anguish, execrate their lot,Then shake them in despair, and dance again.Now basket up the family of plaguesThat waste our vitals. Peculation, saleOf honor, perjury, corruption, frauds
By forgery, by subterfuge of law,By tricks and lies as num'rous and as keenAs the necessities their authors feel;Then cast them closely bundled, ev'ry bratAt the right door. Profusion is its sire.Profusion unrestrain'd, with all that's baseIn character, has litter'd all the land,And bred within the mem'ry of no fewA priesthood such as Baal's was of old,A people such as never was 'till now.It is a hungry vice:—it eats up allThat gives society its beauty, strength,Convenience, and security, and use.Makes men mere vermin, worthy to be trapp'dAnd gibbetted as fast as catchpole clawsCan seize the slipp'ry prey. Unties the knotOf union, and converts the sacred bandThat holds mankind together, to a scourge.Profusion deluging a state with lustsOf grossest nature and of worst effects,
Prepares it for its ruin. Hardens, blinds,And warps the consciences of public menTill they can laugh at virtue; mock the foolsThat trust them; and in th' end, disclose a faceThat would have shock'd credulity herselfUnmask'd, vouchsafing this their sole excuse,Since all alike are selfish—why not they?This does Profusion, and th' accursed causeOf such deep mischief, has itself a cause.In colleges and halls, in ancient days,When learning, virtue, piety and truthWere precious, and inculcated with care,There dwelt a sage call'd Discipline. His headNot yet by time completely silver'd o'er,Bespoke him past the bounds of freakish youth,But strong for service still, and unimpair'd.His eye was meek and gentle, and a smilePlay'd on his lips, and in his speech was heardPaternal sweetness, dignity, and love.
The occupation dearest to his heartWas to encourage goodness. He would strokeThe head of modest and ingenuous worthThat blush'd at its own praise, and press the youthClose to his side that pleas'd him. Learning grewBeneath his care, a thriving vig'rous plant;The mind was well inform'd, the passions heldSubordinate, and diligence was choice.If e'er it chanced, as sometimes chance it must,That one among so many overleap'dThe limits of controul, his gentle eyeGrew stern, and darted a severe rebuke;His frown was full of terror, and his voiceShook the delinquent with such fits of aweAs left him not, till penitence had wonLost favor back again, and closed the breach.But discipline, a faithful servant long,Declined at length into the vale of years;A palsy struck his arm, his sparkling eyeWas quench'd in rheums of age, his voice unstrung
Grew tremulous, and moved derision moreThan rev'rence, in perverse rebellious youth.So colleges and halls neglected muchTheir good old friend, and Discipline at lengthO'erlook'd and unemploy'd, fell sick and died.Then study languish'd, emulation slept,And virtue fled. The schools became a sceneOf solemn farce, where ignorance in stilts,His cap well lined with logic not his own,With parrot tongue perform'd the scholar's part,Proceeding soon a graduated dunce.Then compromise had place, and scrutinyBecame stone-blind, precedence went in truck,And he was competent whose purse was so.A dissolution of all bonds ensued,The curbs invented for the muleish mouthOf head-strong youth were broken; bars and boltsGrew rusty by disuse, and massy gatesForgot their office, op'ning with a touch;'Till gowns at length are found mere masquerade;
The tassell'd cap and the spruce band a jest,A mock'ry of the world. What need of theseFor gamesters, jockies, brothellers impure,Spendthrifts and booted sportsmen, oft'ner seenWith belted waist and pointers at their heels,Than in the bounds of duty? what was learn'd,If aught was learn'd in childhood, is forgot,And such expence as pinches parents blue,And mortifies the lib'ral hand of love,Is squander'd in pursuit of idle sportsAnd vicious pleasures. Buys the boy a name,That sits a stigma on his father's house,And cleaves through life inseparably closeTo him that wears it. What can atter-gamesOf riper joys, and commerce with the world,The lewd vain world that must receive him soon,Add to such erudition thus acquir'dWhere science and where virtue are profess'd?They may confirm his habits, rivet fastHis folly, but to spoil him is a task
That bids defiance to th' united pow'rsOf fashion, dissipation, taverns, stews.Now, blame we most the nurselings or the nurse?The children crook'd and twisted and deform'dThrough want of care, or her whose winking eyeAnd slumb'ring oscitancy marrs the brood?The nurse no doubt. Regardless of her chargeShe needs herself correction. Needs to learnThat it is dang'rous sporting with the world,With things so sacred as a nation's trust,The nurture of her youth, her dearest pledge.All are not such. I had a brother once.—Peace to the mem'ry of a man of worth;A man of letters, and of manners too.Of manners sweet as virtue always wears,When gay good-nature dresses her in smiles.He graced a college Ben'et Coll. Cambridge. in which order yet
Was sacred, and was honor'd, lov'd and weptBy more than one, themselves conspicuous there.Some minds are temper'd happily, and mixtWith such ingredients of good sense and tasteOf what is excellent in man, they thirstWith such a zeal to be what they approve,That no restraints can circumscribe them more,Than they themselves by choice, for wisdom's sake.Nor can example hurt them. What they seeOf vice in others but enhancing moreThe charms of virtue in their just esteem.If such escape contagion, and emergePure, from so foul a pool, to shine abroad,And give the world their talents and themselves,Small thanks to those whose negligence or slothExposed their inexperience to the snare,And left them to an undirected choice.See then! the quiver broken and decay'dIn which are kept our arrows. Rusting there
In wild disorder and unfit for use,What wonder if discharged into the worldThey shame their shooters with a random flight,Their points obtuse, and feathers drunk with wine.Well may the church wage unsuccessful warWith such artill'ry arm'd. Vice parries wideTh' undreaded volley with a sword of straw,And stands an impudent and fearless mark.Have we not track'd the felon home, and foundHis birth-place and his dam? the country mourns,Mourns, because ev'ry plague that can infestSociety, and that saps and worms the baseOf th' edifice that policy has raised,Swarms in all quarters; meets the eye, the ear,And suffocates the breath at ev'ry turn.Profusion breeds them. And the cause itselfOf that calamitous mischief has been found.Found too where most offensive, in the skirtsOf the robed paedagogue. Else, let the arraign'd
Stand up unconscious and refute the charge.So when the Jewish Leader stretched his armAnd waved his rod divine, a race obsceneSpawn'd in the muddy beds of Nile, came forthPolluting Aegypt. Gardens, fields, and plainsWere cover'd with the pest. The streets were fill'd;The croaking nuisance lurk'd in ev'ry nook,Nor palaces nor even chambers 'scaped,And the land stank, so num'rous was the fry.ARGUMENT of the THIRD BOOK.Self-recollection and reproof.—Address to domestic happiness.

T' adorn the Sofa with eulogium due,To tell its slumbers and to paint its dreams,Have rambled wide. In country, city, seatOf academic fame (howe'er deserved)Long held, and scarcely disengaged at last.But now with pleasant pace, a cleanlier roadI mean to tread. I feel myself at large,Courageous, and refresh'd for future toil,If toil await me, or if dangers new.Since pulpits fail, and sounding-boards reflectMost part an empty ineffectual sound,What chance that I, to fame so little known,Nor conversant with men or manners much,Should speak to purpose, or with better hopeCrack the satyric thong? 'twere wiser farFor me enamour'd of sequester'd scenes,And charm'd with rural beauty, to reposeWhere chance may throw me, beneath elm or vine,My languid limbs when summer fears the plains,
Or when rough winter rages, on the softAnd shelter'd Sofa, while the nitrous airFeeds a blue flame and makes a chearful hearth;There undisturb'd by folly, and appriz'dHow great the danger of disturbing her,To muse in silence, or at least confineRemarks that gall so many, to the fewMy partners in retreat. Disgust conceal'dIs oft-times proof of wisdom, when the faultIs obstinate, and cure beyond our reach.Domestic happiness, thou only blissOf Paradise that has survived the fall!Though few now taste thee unimpair'd and pure,Or tasting, long enjoy thee, too infirmOr too incautious to preserve thy sweetsUnmixt with drops of bitter, which neglectOr temper sheds into thy chrystal cup.Thou art the nurse of virtue. In thine armsShe smiles, appearing, as in truth she is,
Heav'n born and destined to the skies again.Thou art not known where pleasure is adored,That reeling goddess with the zoneless waistAnd wand'ring eyes, still leaning on the armOf novelty, her fickle frail support;For thou art meek and constant, hating change,And finding in the calm of truth-tied loveJoys that her stormy raptures never yeild.Forsaking thee, what shipwreck have we madeOf honor, dignity, and fair renown,'Till prostitution elbows us asideIn all our crowded streets, and senates seemConvened for purposes of empire less,Than to release th' adultress from her bond.Th' adultress! what a theme for angry verse,What provocation to th' indignant heartThat feels for injured love! but I disdainThe nauseous task to paint her as she is,Cruel, abandon'd, glorying in her shame.No. Let her pass, and chariotted along
In guilty splendor, shake the public ways;The frequency of crimes has wash'd them white.And verse of mine shall never brand the wretch,Whom matrons now of character unsmirch'dAnd chaste themselves, are not ashamed to own.Virtue and vice had bound'ries in old timeNot to be pass'd. And she that had renouncedHer sex's honor, was renounced herselfBy all that priz'd it; not for prud'ry's sake,But dignity's, resentful of the wrong.'Twas hard perhaps on here and there a waifDesirous to return and not received,But was an wholesome rigor in the main,And taught th' unblemish'd to preserve with careThat purity, whose loss was loss of all.Men too were nice in honor in those days,And judg'd offenders well. And he that sharp'd,And pocketted a prize by fraud obtain'd,Was mark'd and shunn'd as odious. He that soldHis country, or was slack when she required
His ev'ry nerve in action and at stretch,Paid with the blood that he had basely sparedThe price of his default. But now, yes, now,We are become so candid and so fair,So lib'ral in construction, and so richIn christian charity, a good-natured age!That they are safe, sinners of either sex,Transgress what laws they may. Well dress'd, well bred,Well equipaged, is ticket good enoughTo pass us readily through ev'ry door.Hypocrisy, detest her as we may,(And no man's hatred ever wrong'd her yet)May claim this merit still, that she admitsThe worth of what she mimics with such care,And thus gives virtue indirect applause;But she has burnt her mask not needed here,Where vice has such allowance, that her shiftsAnd specious semblances have lost their use.I was a stricken deer that left the herdLong since; with many an arrow deep infixt
My panting side was charged when I withdrewTo seek a tranquil death in distant shades.There was I found by one who had himselfBeen hurt by th' archers. In his side he boreAnd in his hands and feet the cruel scars.With gentle force soliciting the dartsHe drew them forth, and heal'd and bade me live.Since then, with few associates, in remoteAnd silent woods I wander, far from thoseMy former partners of the peopled scene,With few associates, and not wishing more.Here much I ruminate, as much I may,With other views of men and manners nowThan once, and others of a life to come.I see that all are wand'rers, gone astrayEach in his own delusions; they are lostIn chace of fancied happiness, still wooedAnd never won. Dream after dream ensues,And still they dream that they shall still succeed,And still are disappointed; rings the world
With the vain stir. I sum up half mankind,And add two-thirds of the remainder half,And find the total of their hopes and fearsDreams, empty dreams. The million flit as gayAs if created only like the flyThat spreads his motley wings in th' eye of noonTo sport their season and be seen no more.The rest are sober dreamers, grave and wise,And pregnant with discov'ries new and rare.Some write a narrative of wars and featsOf heroes little known, and call the rantAn history. Describe the man, of whomHis own cooevals took but little note,And paint his person, character and views,As they had known him from his mother's womb.They disentangle from the puzzled skeinIn which obscurity has wrapp'd them up,The threads of politic and shrewd designThat ran through all his purposes, and chargeHis mind with meanings that he never had,
Or having, kept conceal'd. Some drill and boreThe solid earth, and from the strata thereExtract a register, by which we learnThat he who made it and reveal'd its dateTo Moses, was mistaken in its age.Some more acute and more industrious stillContrive creation. Travel nature upTo the sharp peak of her sublimest height,And tell us whence the stars. Why some are fixt,And planetary some. What gave them firstRotation, from what fountain flow'd their light.Great contest follows, and much learned dustInvolves the combatants, each claiming truth,And truth disclaiming both. And thus they spendThe little wick of life's poor shallow lamp,In playing tricks with nature, giving lawsTo distant worlds and trifling in their own.Is't not a pity now that tickling rheumsShould ever teaze the Iungs and blear the sightOf oracles like these? Great pity too,
That having wielded th' elements, and builtA thousand systems, each in his own way,They should go out in fume and be forgot?Ah! what is life thus spent? and what are theyBut frantic who thus spend it? all for smoke—Eternity for bubbles, proves at lastA senseless bargain. When I see such gamesPlay'd by the creatures of a pow'r who swearsThat he will judge the earth, and call the foolTo a sharp reck'ning that has lived in vain,And when I weigh this seeming wisdom wellAnd prove it in th' infallible resultSo hollow and so false—I feel my heartDissolve in pity, and account the learn'd,If this be learning, most of all deceived.Great crimes alarm the conscience, but she sleepsWhile thoughtful man is plausibly amused.Defend me therefore common sense, say I,From reveries so airy, from the toil
Of dropping buckets into empty wells,And growing old in drawing nothing up!'Twere well, says one sage erudite, profound,Terribly arch'd and aquiline his nose,And overbuilt with most impending brows,'Twere well could you permit the world to liveAs the world pleases. What's the world to you?Much. I was born of woman, and drew milkAs sweet as charity from human breasts.I think, articulate, I laugh and weepAnd exercise all functions of a man.How then should I and any man that livesBe strangers to each other? pierce my vein,Take of the crimson stream meandring thereAnd catechise it well. Apply your glass,Search it, and prove now if it be not bloodCongenial with thine own. And if it be,What edge of subtlety canst thou supposeKeen enough, wise and skilful as thou art,
To cut the link of brotherhood, by whichOne common Maker bound me to the kind.True; I am no proficient, I confess,In arts like yours. I cannot call the swiftAnd perilous lightnings from the angry clouds,And bid them hide themselves in th' earth beneath,I cannot analyse the air, nor catchThe parallax of yonder luminous pointThat seems half quench'd in the immense abyss;Such pow'rs I boast not—neither can I restA silent witness of the headlong rageOr heedless folly by which thousands die,Bone of my bone, and kindred souls to mine.God never meant that man should scale the heav'nsBy strides of human wisdom. In his worksThough wond'rous, he commands us in his wordTo seek him rather, where his mercy shines.The mind indeed enlighten'd from aboveViews him in all. Ascribes to the grand cause
The grand effect. Acknowledges with joyHis manner, and with rapture tastes his stile.But never yet did philosophic tubeThat brings the planets home into the eyeOf observation, and discovers, elseNot visible, his family of worlds,Discover him that rules them; such a veilHangs over mortal eyes, blind from the birthAnd dark in things divine. Full often tooOur wayward intellect, the more we learnOf nature, overlooks her author more,From instrumental causes proud to drawConclusions retrograde and mad mistake.But if his word once teach us, shoot a rayThrough all the heart's dark chambers, and revealTruths undiscern'd but by that holy light,Then all is plain. Philosophy baptizedIn the pure fountain of eternal loveHas eyes indeed; and viewing all she seesAs meant to indicate a God to man,
Gives him his praise, and forfeits not her own.Learning has borne such fruit in other daysOn all her branches. Piety has foundFriends in the friends of science, and true pray'rHas flow'd from lips wet with Castalian dews.Such was thy wisdom, Newton, childlike sage!Sagacious reader of the works of God,And in his word sagacious. Such too thineMilton, whose genius had angelic wings,And fed on manna. And such thine in whomOur British Themis gloried with just causeImmortal Hale! for deep discernment praisedAnd sound integrity not more, than famedFor sanctity of manners undefiled.All flesh is grass, and all its glory fadesLike the fair flow'r dishevell'd in the wind;Riches have wings, and grandeur is a dream;The man we celebrate must find a tomb,And we that worship him, ignoble graves.
Nothing is proof against the gen'ral curseOf vanity, that seizes all below.The only amaranthine flow'r on earthIs virtue, th' only lasting treasure, truth.But what is truth? 'twas Pilate's question putTo truth itself, that deign'd him no reply.And wherefore? will not God impart his lightTo them that ask it?—Freely—'tis his joy,His glory, and his nature to impart.But to the proud, uncandid, insincereOr negligent enquirer, not a spark.What's that which brings contempt upon a bookAnd him that writes it, though the stile be neat,The method clear, and argument exact?That makes a minister in holy thingsThe joy of many and the dread of more,His name a theme for praise and for reproach?—That while it gives us worth in God's account,Depreciates and undoes us in our own?What pearl is it that rich men cannot buy,
That learning is too proud to gather up,But which the poor and the despised of allSeek and obtain, and often find unsought?Tell me, and I will tell thee, what is truth.Oh friendly to the best pursuits of man,Friendly to thought, to virtue, and to peace,Domestic life in rural leisure pass'd!Few know thy value, and few taste thy sweets,Though many boast thy favours, and affectTo understand and chuse thee for their own.But foolish man foregoes his proper blissEv'n as his first progenitor, and quits,Though placed in paradise (for earth has stillSome traces of her youthful beauty left)Substantial happiness for transient joy.Scenes form'd for contemplation, and to nurseThe growing seeds of wisdom; that suggestBy ev'ry pleasing image they presentReflections such as meliorate the heart,
Compose the passions, and exalt the mind,Scenes such as these, 'tis his supreme delightTo fill with riot and defile with blood.Should some contagion kind to the poor brutesWe persecute, annihilate the tribesThat draw the sportsman over hill and daleFearless, and rapt away from all his cares;Should never game-fowl hatch her eggs again,Nor baited hook deceive the fishes eye;Could pageantry and dance and feast and songBe quell'd in all our summer-month retreats;How many self-deluded nymphs and swainsWho dream they have a taste for fields and groves,Would find them hideous nurs'ries of the spleen,And crowd the roads, impatient for the town!They love the country, and none else, who seekFor their own sake its silence and its shade.Delights which who would leave, that has a heartSusceptible of pity, or a mindCultured and capable of sober thought,
For all the savage din of the swift packAnd clamours of the field? detested sport,That owes its pleasures to another's pain,That feeds upon the sobs and dying shrieksOf harmless nature, dumb, but yet enduedWith eloquence that agonies inspireOf silent tears and heart-distending sighs!Vain tears alas! and sighs that never findA corresponding tone in jovial souls.Well—one at least is safe. One shelter'd hareHas never heard the sanguinary yellOf cruel man, exulting in her woes.Innocent partner of my peaceful home,Whom ten long years experience of my careHas made at last familiar, she has lostMuch of her vigilant instinctive dread,Not needful here, beneath a roof like mine.Yes—thou mayst eat thy bread, and lick the handThat feeds thee; thou may'st frolic on the floorAt evening, and at night retire secure
To thy straw-couch, and slumber unalarm'd.For I have gain'd thy confidence, have pledg'dAll that is human in me, to protectThine unsuspecting gratitude and love.If I survive thee I will dig thy grave,And when I place thee in it, sighing say,I knew at least one hare that had a friend.How various his employments, whom the worldCalls idle, and who justly in returnEsteems that busy world an idler too!Friends, books, a garden, and perhaps his pen,Delighful industry enjoyed at home,And nature in her cultivated trimDressed to his taste, inviting him abroad—Can he want occupation who has these?Will he be idle who has much t' enjoy?Me therefore, studious of laborious ease,Not slothful; happy to deceive the timeNot waste it; and aware that human life
Is but a loan to be repaid with use,When he shall call his debtors to account,From whom are all our blessings, business findsEv'n here. While sedulous I seek t' improve,At least neglect not, or leave unemploy'dThe mind he gave me; driving it, though slackToo oft, and much impeded in its workBy causes not to be divulged in vain,To its just point the service of mankind.He that attends to his interior self,That has a heart and keeps it; has a mindThat hungers and supplies it; and who seeksA social, not a dissipated life,Has business. Feels himself engaged t' atchieveNo unimportant, though a silent task.A life all turbulence and noise, may seemTo him that leads it, wise and to be prais'd;But wisdom is a pearl with most successSought in still water, and beneath clear skies.He that is ever occupied in storms,
Or dives not for it, or brings up instead,Vainly industrious, a disgraceful prize.The morning finds the self-sequester'd manFresh for his task, intend what task he may.Whether inclement seasons recommendHis warm but simple home, where he enjoysWith her who shares his pleasures and his heart,Sweet converse, sipping calm the fragrant lymphWhich neatly she prepares; then to his bookWell chosen, and not sullenly perusedIn selfish silence, but imparted oftAs aught occurs that she may smile to hear,Or turn to nourishment digested well.Or if the garden with its many cares,All well repay'd, demand him, he attendsThe welcome call, conscious how much the handOf lubbard labor needs his watchful eye,Oft loit'ring lazily if not o'erseen,Or misapplying his unskilful strength.
Nor does he govern only or direct,But much performs himself. No works indeedThat ask robust tough sinews bred to toil,Servile employ—but such as may amuse,Not tire, demanding rather skill than force.Proud of his well spread walls, he views his treesThat meet (no barren interval between)With pleasure more than ev'n their fruits afford,Which, save himself who trains them, none can feel.These therefore are his own peculiar charge,No meaner hand may discipline the shoots,None but his steel approach them. What is weak,Distemper'd, or has lost prolific pow'rsImpair'd by age, his unrelenting handDooms to the knife. Nor does he spare the softAnd succulent that feeds its giant growthBut barren, at th' expence of neighb'ring twigsLess ostentatious, and yet studded thickWith hopeful gems. The rest, no portion leftThat may disgrace his art, or disappoint
Large expectation, he disposes neatAt measur'd distances, that air and sunAdmitted freely may afford their aid,And ventilate and warm the swelling buds.Hence summer has her riches, autumn hence,And hence ev'n winter fills his wither'd handWith blushing fruits, and plenty not his own.Miraturque novos fructus et non sua poma. VIRG.Fair recompense of labour well bestow'dAnd wise precaution, which a clime so rudeMakes needful still, whose spring is but the childOf churlish winter, in her froward moodsDiscov'ring much the temper of her sire.For oft, as if in her the stteam of mildMaternal nature had revers'd its course,She brings her infants forth with many smiles,But once deliver'd, kills them with a frown.He therefore, timely warn'd, himself suppliesHer want of care, screening and keeping warmThe plenteous bloom, that no rough blast may sweepHis garlands from the boughs. Again, as oft
As the sun peeps and vernal airs breathe mild,The fence withdrawn, he gives them ev'ry beam,And spreads his hopes before the blaze of day.To raise the prickly and green-coated gourdSo grateful to the palate, and when rareSo coveted, else base and disesteem'd—Food for the vulgar merely—is an artThat toiling ages have but just matured,And at this moment unassay'd in song.Yet gnats have had, and frogs and mice long sinceTheir eulogy; those sang the Mantuan bard,And these the Grecian in ennobling strains,And in thy numbers, Phillips, shines for ayThe solitary shilling. Pardon thenYe sage dispensers of poetic fame!Th' ambition of one meaner far, whose pow'rsPresuming an attempt not less sublime,Pant for the praise of dressing to the taste
Of critic appetite, no sordid fare,A cucumber, while costly yet and scarce.The stable yields a stercorarious heapImpregnated with quick fermenting salts,And potent to resist the freezing blast.For 'ere the beech and elm have cast their leafDecidu'ous, and when now November darkChecks vegetation in the torpid plantExposed to his cold breath, the task begins.Warily therefore, and with prudent heedHe seeks a favor'd spot. That where he buildsTh' agglomerated pile, his frame may frontThe sun's meridian disk, and at the backEnjoy close shelter, wall, or reeds, or hedgeImpervious to the wind. First he bids spreadDry fern or litter'd hay, that may imbibeTh' ascending damps; then leisurely imposeAnd lightly, shaking it with agile handFrom the full fork, the saturated straw.
What longest binds the closest, forms secureThe shapely side, that as it rises takesBy just degrees an overhanging breadth,Shelt'ring the base with its projected eaves.Th' uplifted frame compact at ev'ry joint,And overlaid with clear translucent glassHe settles next upon the sloping mount,Whose sharp declivity shoots off secureFrom the dash'd pane the deluge as it falls.He shuts it close, and the first labor ends.Thrice must the voluble and restless earthSpin round upon her axle, 'ere the warmthSlow gathering in the midst, through the square massDiffused, attain the surface. When behold!A pestilent and most corrosive steam,Like a gross fog Boeotian, rising fast,And fast condensed upon the dewy sash,Asks egress; which obtained, the overchargedAnd drench'd conservatory breathes abroadIn volumes wheeling slow, the vapor dank,
And purified, rejoices to have lostIts foul inhabitant. But to assuageTh' impatient fervor which it first conceivesWithin its reeking bosom, threat'ning deathTo his young hopes, requires discreet delay.Experience, slow preceptress, teaching oftThe way to glory by miscarriage foul,Must prompt him, and admonish how to catchTh' auspicious moment, when the temper'd heatFriendly to vital motion, may affordSoft somentation, and invite the seed.The seed selected wisely, plump and smoothAnd glossy, he commits to pots of sizeDiminutive, well fill'd with well prepar'dAnd fruitful soil, that has been treasur'd long,And drunk no moisture from the dripping clouds.These on the warm and genial earth that hidesThe smoking manure and o'erspreads it all,He places lightly, and as time subduesThe rage of fermentation, plunges deep
In the soft medium, 'till they stand immers'd.Then rise the tender germs upstarting quickAnd spreading wide their spongy lobes, at firstPale, wan, and livid, but assuming soon,If fann'd by balmy and nutritious airStrain'd through the friendly mats, a vivid green.Two leaves produced, two rough indented leaves,Cautious, he pinches from the second stalkA pimple, that portends a future sprout,And interdicts its growth. Thence straight succeedThe branches, sturdy to his utmost wish,Prolific all, and harbingers of more.The crowded roots demand enlargement nowAnd transplantation in an ampler space.Indulged in what they wish, they soon supplyLarge foliage, overshadowing golden flowers,Blown on the summit of th' apparent fruit.These have their sexes, and when summer shinesThe bee transports the fertilizing mealFrom flow'r to flow'r, and ev'n the breathing air
Wafts the rich prize to its appointed use.Not so when winter scowls. Assistant artThen acts in nature's office, brings to passThe glad espousals and insures the crop.Grudge not ye rich (since luxury must haveHis dainties, and the world's more num'rous halfLives by contriving delicates for you)Grudge not the cost. Ye little know the cares,The vigilance, the labor and the skillThat day and night are exercised, and hangUpon the ticklish balance of suspense,That ye may garnish your profuse regalesWith summer fruits brought forth by wintry suns.Ten thousand dangers lie in wait to thwartThe process. Heat and cold, and wind and steam,Moisture and drought, mice, worms, and swarming fliesMinute as dust and numberless, oft workDire disappointment that admits no cure,And which no care can obviate. It were long,
Too long to tell th' expedients and the shiftsWhich he that fights a season so severeDevises, while he guards his tender trust,And oft, at last, in vain. The learn'd and wiseSarcastic would exclaim, and judge the songCold as its theme, and like its theme, the fruitOf too much labor, worthless when produced.Who loves a garden, loves a green-house too.Unconscious of a less propitious climeThere blooms exotic beauty, warm and snug,While the winds whistle and the snows descend.The spiry myrtle with unwith'ring leafShines there and flourishes. The golden boastOf Portugal and western India there,The ruddier orange and the paler limePeep through their polish'd foliage at the storm,And seem to smile at what they need not sear.Th' amomum there with intermingling flow'rsAnd cherries hangs her twigs. Geranium boasts
Her crimson honors, and the spangled beauFicoides, glitters bright the winter long.All plants of ev'ry leaf that can endureThe winter's frown if screen'd from his shrewd bite,Live there and prosper. Those Ausonia claims,Levantine regions these; th' Azores sendTheir jessamine, her jessamine remoteCaffraia; foreigners from many landsThey form one social shade, as if convenedBy magic summons of th' Orphean lyre.Yet just arrangement, rarely brought to passBut by a master's hand, disposing wellThe gay diversities of leaf and flow'r,Must lend its aid t' illustrate all their charms,And dress the regular yet various scene.Plant behind plant aspiring, in the vanThe dwarfish, in the rear retired, but stillSublime above the rest, the statelier stand.So once were ranged the sons of ancient Rome,A noble show! while Roscius trod the stage;And so, while Garrick as renown'd as he,
The sons of Albion; fearing each to loseSome note of Nature's music from his lips,And covetous of Shakespeare's beauty seenIn ev'ry flash of his far-beaming eye.Nor taste alone and well contrived displaySuffice to give the marshall'd ranks the graceOf their complete effect. Much yet remainsUnsung, and many cares are yet behindAnd more laborious. Cares on which dependsTheir vigor, injured soon, not soon restored.The soil must be renew'd, which often wash'dLoses its treasure of salubrious salts,And disappoints the roots; the slender rootsClose interwoven where they meet the vaseMust smooth be shorn away; the sapless branchMust fly before the knife; the wither'd leafMust be detach'd, and where it strews the floorSwept with a woman's neatness, breeding elseContagion, and disseminating death.Discharge but these kind offices, (and who
Would spare, that loves them, offices like these?)Well they reward the toil. The sight is pleased,The scent regaled, each odorif'rous leaf,Each opening blossom freely breathes abroadIts gratitude, and thanks him with its sweets.So manifold, all pleasing in their kind,All healthful, are th' employs of rural life,Reiterated as the wheel of timeRuns round, still ending, and beginning still.Nor are these all. To deck the shapely knollThat softly swell'd and gayly dress'd, appearsA flow'ry island from the dark green lawnEmerging, must be deemed a labor dueTo no mean hand, and asks the touch of taste.Here also gratefull mixture of well match'dAnd sorted hues, (each giving each relief,And by contrasted beauty shining more)Is needful. Strength may wield the pond'rous spade,May turn the clod, and wheel the compost home,
But elegance, chief grace the garden showsAnd most attractive, is the fair resultOf thought, the creature of a polish'd mind.Without it, all is Gothic as the sceneTo which th' insipid citizen resortsNear yonder heath; where industry mispent,But proud of his uncouth ill-chosen task,Has made a heav'n on earth. With suns and moonsOf close-ramm'd stones has charged th' incumber'd soil,And fairly laid the Zodiac in the dust.He therefore who would see his flow'rs disposedSightly and in just order, 'ere he givesThe beds the trusted treasure of their seedsForecasts the future whole. That when the sceneShall break into its preconceived display,Each for itself, and all as with one voiceConspiring, may attest his bright design.Nor even then, dismissing as perform'dHis pleasant work, may he suppose it done.Few self-supported flow'rs endure the wind
Uninjured, but expect th' upholding aidOf the smooth-shaven prop, and neatly tiedAre wedded thus like beauty to old age,For int'rest sake, the living to the dead.Some cloath the soil that feeds them, far diffusedAnd lowly creeping, modest and yet fair,Like virtue, thriving most where little seen.Some more aspiring catch the neighbour shrubWith clasping tendrils, and invest his branchElse unadorn'd, with many a gay festoonAnd fragrant chaplet, recompensing wellThe strength they borrow with the grace they lend.All hate the rank society of weedsNoisome, and ever greedy to exhaustTh' improv'rish'd earth; an overbearing race,That like the multitude made faction-madDisturb good order, and degrade true worth.Oh blest seclusion from a jarring worldWhich he thus occupied, enjoys! Retreat
Cannot indeed to guilty man restoreLost innocence, or cancel sollies past,But it has peace, and much secures the mindFrom all assaults of evil, proving stillA faithful barrier, not o'erleap'd with easeBy vicious custom, raging uncontroul'dAbroad, and desolating public life.When fierce temptation seconded withinBy traitor appetite, and arm'd with dartsTemper'd in hell, invades the throbbing breast,To combat may be glorious, and successPerhaps may crown us, but to fly is safe.Had I the choice of sublunary good,What could I wish, that I possess not here?Health, leisure, means t' improve it, friendship, peace,No loose or wanton, though a wand'ring muse,And constant occupation without care.Thus blest, I draw a picture of that bliss;Hopeless indeed that dissipated minds,And profligate abusers of a world
Created fair so much in vain for them,Should seek the guiltless joys that I describeAllured by my report. But sure no lessThat self-condemn'd they must neglect the prize,And what they will not taste, must yet approve.What we admire we praise. And when we praiseAdvance it into notice, that its worthAcknowledg'd, others may admire it too.I therefore recommend, though at the riskOf popular disgust, yet boldly still,The cause of piety and sacred truthAnd virtue, and those scenes which God ordain'dShould best secure them and promote them most;Scenes that I love, and with regret perceiveForsaken, or through folly not enjoyed.Pure is the nymph, though lib'ral of her smiles,And chaste, though unconfined, whom I extoll.Not as the prince in Sushan, when he call'dVain-glorious of her charms his Vashti forthTo grace the full pavilion. Hi design
Was but to boast his own peculiar good,Which all might view with envy, none partake.My charmer is not mine alone; my sweetsAnd she that sweetens all my bitters too,Nature, enchanting Nature, in whose formAnd lineaments divine I trace a handThat errs not, and find raptures still renew'd,Is free to all men, universal prize.Strange that so fair a creature should yet wantAdmirers, and be destin'd to divideWith meaner objects, ev'n the few she finds.Stripp'd of her ornaments, her leaves and flow'rs,She loses all her influence. Cities thenAttract us, and neglected Nature pinesAbandon'd, as unworthy of our love.But are not wholesome airs, though unperfumedBy roses, and clear suns though scarcely felt,And groves if unharmonious, yet secureFrom clamour, and whose very silence charms,To be preferr'd to smoke, to the eclipse
That Metropolitan volcano's make,Whose Stygian throats breathe darkness all day long,And to the stir of commerce, driving slow,And thund'ring loud, with his ten thousand wheels?They would be, were not madness in the headAnd folly in the heart; were England nowWhat England was, plain, hospitable, kind,And undebauch'd. But we have bid farewellTo all the virtues of those better days,And all their honest pleasures. Mansions onceKnew their own masters, and laborious hindsThat had surviv'd the father, serv'd the son.Now the legitimate and rightful LordIs but a transient guest, newly arrivedAnd soon to be supplanted. He that sawHis patrimonial timber cast its leaf,Sells the last scantling, and transfers the priceTo some shrew'd sharper, 'ere it buds again.Estates are landscapes, gazed upon awhile,Then advertised, and auctioneer'd away.
The country starves, and they that feed th' o'erchargedAnd surfeited lew'd town with her fair dues,By a just judgment strip and starve themselves.The wings that waft our riches out of sightGrow on the gamester's elbows, and th' alertAnd nimble motion of those restless jointsThat never tire, soon fans them all away.Improvement too, the idol of the age,Is fed with many a victim. Lo! he comes—The omnipotent magician, Brown appears.Down falls the venerable pile, th' abodeOf our forefathers, a grave whisker'd race,But tasteless. Springs a palace in its stead,But in a distant spot; where more exposedIt may enjoy th' advantage of the northAnd agueish East, till time shall have transform'dThose naked acres to a shelt'ring grove.He speaks. The lake in front becomes a lawn,Woods vanish, hills subside, and vallies rise,And streams as if created for his use,
Pursue the track of his directing wandSinuous or strait, now rapid and now slow,Now murm'ring soft, now roaring in cascades,Ev'n as he bids. Th' enraptur'd owner smiles.'Tis finish'd. And yet finish'd as it seems,Still wants a grace, th' loveliest it could show,A mine to satisfy the enormous cost.Drain'd to the last poor item of his wealthHe sighs, departs, and leaves the accomplished planThat he has touch'd, retouch'd, many a long dayLabor'd, and many a night pursued in dreams,Just when it meets his hopes, and proves the heav'nHe wanted, for a wealthier to enjoy.And now perhaps the glorious hour is come,When having no stake left, no pledge t' indearHer int'rests, or that gives her sacred causeA moment's operation on his love,He burns with most intense and flagrant zealTo serve his country. Ministerial graceDeals him out money from the public chest,
Or if that mine be shut, some private purseSupplies his need with an usurious loanTo be refunded duely, when his voteWell-managed, shall have earn'd its worthy price.Oh innocent compared with arts like these,Crape and cock'd pistol and the whistling ballSent through the trav'llers temples! he that findsOne drop of heav'ns sweet mercy in his cup,Can dig, beg, rot, and perish well-content,So he may wrap himself in honest ragsAt his last gasp; but could not for a worldFish up his dirty and dependent breadFrom pools and ditches of the commonwealth,Sordid and sick'ning at his own success.Ambition, av'rice, penury incurr'dBy endless riot; vanity, the lustOf pleasure and variety, dispatchAs duely as the swallows disappear,The world of wand'ring knights and squires to town.
London ingulphs them all. The shark is thereAnd the shark's prey. The spendthrist and the leechThat sucks him. There the sycophant and heThat with bare-headed and obsequious bowsBegs a warm office, doom'd to a cold jailAnd groat per diem if his patron frown.The levee swarms, as if in golden pompWere character'd on ev'ry statesman's door,"BATTER'D AND BANKRUPT FOR TUNES MENDED HERE"These are the charms that sully and eclipseThe charms of nature. 'Tis the cruel gripeThat lean hard-handed poverty inflicts,The hope of better things, the chance to win,The wish to shine, the thirst to be amused,That at the sound of Winter's hoary wing,Unpeople all our counties, of such herdsOf flutt'ring, loit'ring, cringing, begging, looseAnd wanton vagrants, as make London, vastAnd boundless as it is, a crowded coop.Oh thou resort and mart of all the earth,Chequer'd with all complexions of mankind,And spotted with all crimes; in whom I seeMuch that I love, and more that I admire,And all that I abhor; thou freckled fairThat pleases and yet shocks me, I can laughAnd I can weep, can hope, and can despond,Feel wrath and pity when I think on thee!Ten righteous would have saved a city once,And thou hast many righteous.—Well for thee—That salt preserves thee; more corrupted else,And therefore more obnoxious at this hour,Than Sodom in her day had pow'r to be,For whom God heard his Abr'am plead in vain.ARGUMENT of the FOURTH BOOK.The post comes in.—The news-paper is read.—The world

bridgeThat with its wearisome but needful lengthBestrides the wintry flood, in which the moonSees her unwrinkled face reflected bright,He comes, the herald of a noisy world,With spatter'd boots, strapp'd waist, and frozen locks,News from all nations lumb'ring at his back.True to his charge the close-pack'd load behind,Yet careless what he brings, his one concernIs to conduct it to the destin'd inn,
And having dropp'd th' expected bag—pass on.He whistles as he goes, light-hearted wretch,Cold and yet cheerful: messenger of griefPerhaps to thousands, and of joy to some,To him indiff'rent whether grief or joy.Houses in ashes, and the fall of stocks,Births, deaths, and marriages, epistles wetWith tears that trickled down the writers cheeksFast as the periods from his fluent quill,Or charged with am'rous sighs of absent swainsOr nymphs responsive, equally affectHis horse and him, unconscious of them all.But oh th' important budget! usher'd inWith such heart-shaking music, who can sayWhat are its tidings? have our troops awaked?Or do they still, as if with opium drugg'd,Snore to the murmurs of th' Atlantic wave?Is India free? and does she wear her plumedAnd jewelled turban with a smile of peace,Or do we grind her still? the grand debate,
The popular harrangue, the tart reply,The logic and the wisdom and the witAnd the loud laugh—I long to know them all;I burn to set th' imprison'd wranglers free,And give them voice and utt'rance once again.Now stir the fire, and close the shutters fast,Let fall the curtains, wheel the sofa round,And while the bubbling and loud-hissing urnThrows up a steamy column, and the cupsThat cheer but not inebriate, wait on each,So let us welcome peaceful evening in.Not such his evening, who with shining faceSweats in the crowded theatre, and squeezedAnd bored with elbow-points through both his sides,Out scolds the ranting actor on the stage.Nor his, who patient stands 'till his feet throbAnd his head thumps, to feed upon the breathOf patriots bursting with heroic rage,Or placemen, all tranquillity and smiles.
'This folio of four pages, happy work!Which not ev'n critics criticise, that holdsInquisitive attention while I readFast bound in chains of silence, which the fair,Though eloquent themselves, yet fear to break,What is it but a map of busy lifeIts fluctuations and its vast concerns?Here runs the mountainous and craggy ridgeThat tempts ambition. On the summit, see,The seals of office glitter in his eyes;He climbs, he pants, he grasps them. At his heels,Close at his heels a demagogue ascends,And with a dext'rous jerk soon twists him downAnd wins them, but to lose them in his turn.Here rills of oily eloquence in softMaeanders lubricate the course they take;The modest speaker is ashamed and grievedT' engross a moment's notice, and yet begs,Begs a propitious ear for his poor thoughts,However trivial all that he conceives.
Sweet bashfulness! it claims, at least, this praise,The dearth of information and good senseThat it foretells us, always comes to pass.Cataracts of declamation thunder here,There forests of no-meaning spread the pageIn which all comprehension wanders lost;While fields of pleasantry amuse us there,With merry descants on a nation's woes.The rest appears a wilderness of strangeBut gay confusion, roses for the cheeksAnd lilies for the brows of faded age,Teeth for the toothless, ringlets for the bald,Heav'n, earth, and ocean plunder'd of their sweets,Nectareous essences, Olympian dews,Sermons and city feasts and fav'rite airs,Aetherial journies, submarine exploits,And Katterfelto with his hair on endAt his own wonders, wond'ring for his bread.Tis pleasant through the loop-holes of retreatTo peep at such a world. To see the stir
Of the great Babel and not feel the crowd.To hear the roar she sends through all her gatesAt a safe distance, where the dying soundFalls a soft murmur on th' uninjured ear.Thus sitting and surveying thus at easeThe globe and its concerns, I seem advancedTo some secure and more than mortal height,That lib'rates and exempts me from them all.It turns submitted to my view, turns roundWith all its generations; I beholdThe tumult and am still. The sound of warHas lost its terrors 'ere it reaches me,Grieves but alarms me not. I mourn the prideAnd av'rice that make man a wolf to man,Hear the faint echo of those brazen throatsBy which he speaks the language of his heart,And sigh, but never tremble at the sound.He travels and expatiates, as the beeFrom flow'r to flow'r, so he from land to land;The manners, customs, policy of all
Pay contribution to the store he gleans,He sucks intelligence in ev'ry clime,And spreads the honey of his deep researchAt his return, a rich repast for me.He travels and I too. I tread his deck,Ascend his topmast, through his peering eyesDiscover countries, with a kindred heartSuffer his woes and share in his escapes,While fancy, like the finger of a clock,Runs the great circuit, and is still at home.Oh Winter! ruler of th' inverted year,Thy scatter'd hair with sleet like ashes fill'd,Thy breath congeal'd upon thy lips, thy cheeksFring'd with a beard made white with other snowsThan those of age; thy forehead wrapt in clouds,A leafless branch thy sceptre, and thy throneA sliding car indebted to no wheels,But urged by storms along its slipp'ry way;I love thee, all unlovely as thou seem'st,
And dreaded as thou art. Thou hold'st the sunA pris'ner in the yet undawning East,Short'ning his journey between morn and noon,And hurrying him impatient of his stayDown to the rosy West. But kindly stillCompensating his loss with added hoursOf social converse and instructive ease,And gathering at short notice in one groupThe family dispersed, and fixing thoughtNot less dispersed by day light and its cares.I crown thee King of intimate delights,Fireside enjoyments, home-born happiness,And all the comforts that the lowly roofOf undisturb'd retirement, and the hoursOf long uninterrupted evening know.No ratt'ling wheels stop short before these gates.No powder'd pert proficient in the artOf sounding an alarm, assaults these doors'Till the street rings. No stationary steedsCough their own knell, while heedless of the sound
The silent circle fan themselves, and quake.But here the needle plies its busy task,The pattern grows, the well-depicted flow'rWrought patiently into the snowy lawnUnfolds its bosom, buds and leaves and sprigsAnd curling tendrils, gracefully disposed,Follow the nimble finger of the fair,A wreath that cannot fade, of flow'rs that blowWith most success when all besides decay.The poet's or historian's page, by oneMade vocal for th' amusement of the rest;The sprightly lyre, whose treasure of sweet soundsThe touch from many a trembling chord shakes out;And the clear voice symphonious, yet distinct,And in the charming strife triumphant still,Beguile the night, and set a keener edgeOn female industry; the threaded steelFlies swiftly, and unfelt the task proceeds,The volume closed, the customary ritesOf the last meal commence. A Roman meal.
Such as the mistress of the world once foundDelicious, when her patriots of high note,Perhaps by moonlight, at their humble doors,And under an old oak's domestic shadeEnjoyed, spare feast! a radish and an egg.Discourse ensues, not trivial, yet not dull,Nor such as with a frown forbids the playOf fancy, or proscribes the sound of mirth.Nor do we madly, like an impious world,Who deem religion frenzy, and the GodThat made them an intruder on their joys,Start at his awful name, or deem his praiseA jarring note. Themes of a graver toneExciting oft our gratitude and love,While we retrace with mem'ry's pointing wandThat calls the past to our exact review,The dangers we have scaped, the broken snare,The disappointed foe, deliv'rance foundUnlook'd for, life preserved and peace restored,Fruits of omnipotent eternal love.
Oh evenings worthy of the Gods! exclaim'dThe Sabine bard. Oh evenings, I reply,More to be prized and coveted than yours,As more illumin'd and with nobler truths,That I and mine and those we love, enjoy.Is winter hideous in a garb like this?Needs he the tragic fur, the smoke of lamps,The pent-up breath of an unsav'ry throngTo thaw him into feeling, or the smartAnd snappish dialogue that flippant witsCall comedy, to prompt him with a smile?The self-complacent actor when he views(Stealing a side long glance at a full house)The slope of faces from the floor to th' roof,(As if one master-spring controul'd them all)Relax'd into an universal grin,Sees not a count'nance there that speaks a joyHalf so refin'd or so sincere as ours.Cards were superfluous here, with all the tricks
That idleness has ever yet contrivedTo fill the void of an unfurnish'd brain,To palliate dullness and give time a shove.Time as he passes us, has a dove's wing,Unsoiled and swift and of a silken sound.But the world's time, is time in masquerade.Theirs, should I paint him, has his pinions fledg'dWith motley plumes, and where the peacock showsHis azure eyes, is tinctured black and redWith spots quadrangular of di'mond form,Ensanguin'd hearts, clubs typical of strife,And spades, the emblem of untimely graves.What should be, and what was an hour-glass onceBecomes a dice-box, and a billiard mastWell does the work of his destructive scythe.Thus deck'd he charms a world whom fashion blindsTo his true worth, most pleas'd when idle most,Whose only happy are their wasted hours.Ev'n misses, at whose age their mother's woreThe back-string and the bib, assume the dress
Of womanhood, sit pupils in the schoolOf card-devoted time, and night by nightPlac'd at some vacant corner of the board,Learn ev'ry trick, and soon play all the game.But truce with censure. Roving as I rove,Where shall I find an end, or how proceed?As he that travels far, oft turns asideTo view some rugged rock or mould'ring tow'r,Which seen delights him not; then coming home,Describes and prints it, that the world may knowHow far he went for what was nothing worth;So I with brush in hand and pallet spreadWith colours mixt for a far diff'rent use,Paint cards and dolls, and ev'ry idle thingThat fancy finds in her excursive flights.Come evening once again, season of peace,Return sweet evening, and continue long!Methinks I see thee in the streaky west,With matron-step slow-moving, while the night
Treads on thy sweeping train; one hand employ'dIn letting fall the curtain of reposeOn bird and beast, the other charged for manWith sweet oblivion of the cares of day;Not sumptuously adorn'd, nor needing aidLike homely featur'd night, of clust'ring gems,A star or two just twinkling on thy browSuffices thee; save that the moon is thineNo less than hers, not worn indeed on highWith ostentatious pageantry, but setWith modest grandeur in thy purple zone,Resplendent less, but of an ampler round.Come then, and thou shalt find thy vot'try calmOr make me so. Composure is thy gift.And whether I devote thy gentle hoursTo books, to music, or the poets toil,To weaving nets for bird-alluring fruit;Or twining silken threads round iv'ry reelsWhen they command whom man was born to please,I slight thee not, but make thee welcome still.
Just when our drawing-rooms begin to blazeWith lights by clear reflection multipliedFrom many a mirrour, in which he of GathGoliah, might have seen his giant bulkWhole without stooping, tow'ring crest and all,My pleasures too begin. But me perhapsThe glowing hearth may satisfy awhileWith faint illumination that upliftsThe shadow to the cieling, there by fitsDancing uncouthly to the quiv'ring flame.Not undelightful is an hour to meSo spent in parlour twilight; such a gloomSuits well the thoughtfull or unthinking mind,The mind contemplative, with some new themePregnant, or indisposed alike to all.Laugh ye, who boast your more mercurial pow'rsThat never feel a stupor, know no pauseNor need one. I am conscious, and confessFearless, a soul that does not always think.Me oft has fancy ludicrous and wild
Sooth'd with a waking dream of houses, tow'rs,Trees, churches, and strange visages express'dIn the red cinders, while with poring eyeI gazed, myself creating what I saw.Nor less amused have I quiescent watch'dThe sooty films that play upon the barsPendulous, and foreboding in the viewOf superstition prophesying stillThough still deceived, some strangers near approach.'Tis thus the understanding takes reposeIn indolent vacuity of thought,And sleeps and is refresh'd. Meanwhile the faceConceals the mood lethargic with a maskOf deep deliberation, as the manWere task'd to his full strength, absorb'd and lost.Thus oft reclin'd at ease, I lose an hourAt evening, till at length the freezing blastThat sweeps the bolted shutter, summons homeThe recollected powers, and snapping shortThe glassy threads with which the fancy weaves
Her brittle toys, restores me to myself.How calm is my recess, and how the frostRaging abroad, and the rough wind, endearThe silence and the warmth enjoy'd within.I saw the woods and fields at close of dayA variegated show; the meadows greenThough faded, and the lands where lately wavedThe golden harvest, of a mellow brown,Upturn'd so lately by the forceful share.I saw far off the weedy fallows smileWith verdure not unprofitable, grazedBy flocks fast feeding and selecting eachHis fav'rite herb; while all the leafless grovesThat skirt th' horizon wore a sable hue,Scarce noticed in the kindred dusk of eve.To-morrow brings a change, a total change!Which even now, though silently perform'dAnd slowly, and by most unfelt, the faceOf universal nature undergoes.Fast falls a fleecy show'r. The downy flakes
Descending and with never-ceasing lapseSoftly alighting upon all below,Assimilate all objects. Earth receivesGladly the thick'ning mantle, and the greenAnd tender blade that fear'd the chilling blast,Escapes unhurt beneath so warm a veil.In such a world, so thorny, and where noneFinds happiness unblighted, or if sound,Without some thistly sorrow at its side,It seems the part of wisdom, and no sinAgainst the law of love, to measure lotsWith less distinguish'd than ourselves, that thusWe may with patience bear our mod'rate ills,And sympathize with others, suffering more.Ill fares the trav'ller now, and he that stalksIn pond'rous boots beside his reeking team.The wain goes heavily, impeded soreBy congregated loads adhering closeTo the clogg'd wheels; and in its sluggish pace
Noiseless, appears a moving hill of snow.The toiling steeds expand the nostril wide,While ev'ry breath by respiration strongForced downward, is consolidated soonUpon their jutting chests. He, form'd to bearThe pelting brunt of the tempestuous night,With half-shut eyes and pucker'd cheeks, and teethPresented bare against the storm, plods on.One hand secures his hat, save when with bothHe brandishes his pliant length of whip,Resounding oft, and never heard in vain.On happy! and in my account, deniedThat sensibility of pain with whichRefinement is endued, thrice happy thou.Thy frame robust and hardy, feels indeedThe piercing cold, but feels it unimpair'd.The learned finger never need exploreThy vig'rous pulse, and the unhealthful East,That breathes the spleen, and searches ev'ry boneOf the infirm, is wholesome air to thee.
Thy days roll on exempt from household care,Thy waggon is thy wife; and the poor beastsThat drag the dull companion to and fro,Thine helpless charge, dependent on thy care.Ah treat them kindly! rude as thou appear'stYet show that thou hast mercy, which the greatWith needless hurry whirl'd from place to place,Humane as they would seem, not always show.Poor, yet industrious, modest, quiet, neat,Such claim compassion in a night like this,And have a friend in ev'ry feeling heart.Warm'd, while it lasts, by labor, all day longThey brave the season, and yet find at eveIll clad and fed but sparely time to cool.The frugal housewife trembles when she lightsHer scanty stock of brush-wood, blazing clearBut dying soon, like all terrestrial joys.The few small embers left she nurses well,And while her infant race with outspread hands
And crowded knees sit cow'ring o'er the sparks,Retires, content to quake, so they be warm'd.The man feels least, as more inur'd than sheTo winter, and the current in his veinsMore briskly moved by his severer toil;Yet he too finds his own distress in theirs.The taper soon extinguished, which I sawDangled along at the cold fingers endJust when the day declined, and the brown loafLodged on the shelf half-eaten without sauceOf sav'ry cheese, or butter costlier still,Sleep seems their only refuge. For alas!Where penury is felt the thought is chain'd,And sweet colloquial pleasures are but few.With all this thrift they thrive not. All the careIngenious parsimony takes, but justSaves the small inventory, bed and stool,Skillet and old carved chest from public sale,They live, and live without extorted almsFrom grudging hands, but other boast have none
To sooth their honest pride that scorns to beg,Nor comfort else, but in their mutual love.I praise you much, ye meek and patient pair,For ye are worthy; chusing rather farA dry but independent crust, hard-earn'dAnd eaten with a sigh, than to endureThe rugged frowns and insolent rebuffsOf knaves in office, partial in the workOf distribution; lib'ral of their aidTo clam'rous importunity in rags,But oft-times deaf to suppliants who would blushTo wear a tatter'd garb however coarse,Whom famine cannot reconcile to filth;These ask with painful shyness, and refusedBecause deserving, silently retire.But be ye of good courage. Time itselfShall much befriend you. Time shall give increase,And all your num'rous progeny well train'dBut helpless, in few years shall find their hands,And labor too. Meanwhile ye shall not want
What conscious of your virtues we can spare,Nor what a wealthier than ourselves may send.I mean the man, who when the distant poorNeed help, denies them nothing but his name.But poverty with most who whimper forthTheir long complaints, is self inflicted woe,Th' effect of laziness or sottish waste.Now goes the nightly thief prowling abroadFor plunder; much solicitous how bestHe may compensate for a day of sloth,By works of darkness and nocturnal wrong.Woe to the gard'ner's pale, the farmer's hedgePlash'd neatly, and secured with driven stakesDeep in the loamy bank. Uptorn by strengthResistless in so bad a cause, but lameTo better deeds, he bundles up the spoilAn asses burthen, and when laden mostAnd heaviest, light of foot steals fast away.Nor does the boarded hovel better guard
The well stack'd pile of riven logs and rootsFrom his pernicious force. Nor will he leaveUnwrench'd the door however well secured,Where chanticleer amidst his haram sleepsIn unsuspecting pomp. Twitched from the perchHe gives the princely bird with all his wivesTo his voracious bag, struggling in vain,And loudly wond'ring at the sudden change.Nor this to feed his own. 'Twere some excuseDid pity of their sufferings warp asideHis principle, and tempt him into sinFor their support, so destitute. But theyNeglected pine at home, themselves, as moreExposed than others, with less scruple madeHis victims, robb'd of their defenceless all.Cruel is all he does. 'Tis quenchless thirstOf ruinous ebriety that promptsHis ev'ry action and imbrutes the man.Oh for a law to noose the villain's neckWho starves his own. Who persecutes the blood
He gave them in his childrens veins, and hatesAnd wrongs the woman he has sworn to love.Pass where we may, through city or through town,Village or hamlet of this merry landThough lean and beggar'd, ev'ry twentieth paceConducts the unguarded nose to such a whiffOf stale debauch forth-issuing from the styesThat law has licensed, as makes temp'rance reel.There sit involved and lost in curling cloudsOf Indian fume, and guzzling deep, the boor,The lacquey and the groom. The craftsman thereTakes a Lethaean leave of all his toil;Smith, cobler, joiner, he that plies the sheers,And he that kneads the dough; all loud alike,All learned, and all drunk. The fiddle screamsPlaintive and piteous, as it wept and wailedIts wasted tones and harmony unheard:Fierce the dispute whate'er the theme. While she,Fell Discord, arbitress of such debate,
Perch'd on the sign-post, holds with even handHer undecisive scales. In this she laysA weight of ignorance, in that, of pride,And smiles delighted with th' eternal poise.Dire is the frequent curse and its twin soundThe cheek-distending oath, not to be praisedAs ornamental, musical, polite,Like those which modern senators employ,Whose oath is rhet'ric, and who swear for fame.Behold the schools in which plebeian minds,Once simple, are initiated in artsWhich some may practise with politer grace,But none with readier skill! tis here they learnThe road that leads from competence and peaceTo indigence and rapine; till at lastSociety grown weary of the load,Shakes her incumber'd lap, and casts them out.But censure profits little. Vain th' attemptTo advertize in verse a public pest,That like the filth with which the peasant feeds
His hungry acres, stinks and is of use.Th' excise is fatten'd with the rich resultOf all this riot. And ten thousand casksFor ever dribbling out their base contents,Touched by the Midas finger of the state,Bleed gold for Ministers to sport away.Drink and be mad then. 'Tis your country bids.Gloriously drunk obey th' important call,Her cause demands th' assistance of your throats,Ye all can swallow, and she asks no more.Would I had fall'n upon those happier daysThat poets celebrate. Those golden timesAnd those Arcadian scenes that Maro sings,And Sydney, warbler of poetic prose.Nymphs were Dianas then, and swains had heartsThat felt their virtues. Innocence it seems,From courts dismiss'd, found shelter in the groves.The footsteps of simplicity impress'dUpon the yielding herbage (so they sing)
Then were not all effaced. Then, speech profaneAnd manners profligate were rarely found,Observed as prodigies, and soon reclaim'd.Vain wish! those days were never. Airy dreamsSat for the picture. And the poet's handImparting substance to an empty shade,Imposed a gay delirium for a truth.Grant it. I still must envy them an ageThat favor'd such a dream, in days like theseImpossible, when virtue is so scarceThat to suppose a scene where she presides,Is tramontane, and stumbles all belief.No. We are polish'd now. The rural lassWhom once her virgin modesty and grace,Her artless manners and her neat attireSo dignified, that she was hardly lessThan the fair shepherdess of old romance,Is seen no more. The character is lost.Her head adorn'd with lappets pinn'd aloftAnd ribbands streaming gay, superbly raised
And magnified beyond all human size,Indebted to some smart wig-weavers handFor more than half the tresses it sustains;Her elbows ruffled, and her tott'ring formIll propp'd upon French heels; she might be deemed(But that the basket dangling on her armInterprets her more truely) of a rankToo proud for dairy-work or sale of eggs.Expect her soon with foot-boy at her heels,No longer blushing for her aukward load,Her train and her umbrella all her care.The town has tinged the country. And the stainAppears a spot upon a vestal's robe,The worse for what it soils. The fashion runsDown into scenes still rural, but alas!Scenes rarely graced with rural manners now.Time was when in the pastoral retreatTh' unguarded door was safe. Men did not watchT' invade another's right, or guard their own.
Then sleep was undisturb'd by fear, unscaredBy drunken howlings; and the chilling taleOf midnight murther was a wonder heardWith doubtful credit, told to frighten babes.But farewell now to unsuspicious nightsAnd slumbers unalarm'd. Now 'ere you sleepSee that your polish'd arms be prim'd with care,And drop the night-bolt. Ruffians are abroad,And the first larum of the cock's shrill throatMay prove a trumpet, summoning your earTo horrid sounds of hostile feet within.Ev'n day-light has its dangers. And the walkThrough pathless wastes and woods, unconscious onceOf other tenants than melodious birdsOr harmless flocks, is hazardous and bold.Lamented change! to which full many a causeInvet'rate, hopeless of a cure, conspires.The course of human things from good to ill,From ill to worse, is fatal, never fails.Increase of pow'r begets increase of wealth,
Wealth luxury, and luxury excess;Excess, the scrophulous and itchy plagueThat seizes first the opulent, descendsTo the next rank contagious, and in timeTaints downward all the graduated scaleOf order, from the chariot to the plough.The rich, and they that have an arm to checkThe license of the lowest in degree,Desert their office; and themselves intentOn pleasure, haunt the capital, and thus,To all the violence of lawless handsResign the scenes their presence might protect.Authority herself not seldom sleeps,Though resident, and witness of the wrong.The plump convivial parson often bearsThe magisterial sword in vain, and laysHis rev'rence and his worship both to restOn the same cushion of habitual sloth.Perhaps timidity restrains his arm,When he should strike, he trembles, and sets free,
Himself enslaved by terror of the band,Th' audacious convict whom he dares not bind.Perhaps, though by profession ghostly pure,He too may have his vice, and sometimes proveLess dainty than becomes his grave outside,In lucrative concerns. Examine wellHis milk-white hand. The palm is hardly clean—But here and there an ugly smutch appears.Foh! 'twas a bribe that left it. He has touchedCorruption. Whoso seeks an audit herePropitious, pays his tribute, game or fish,Wildfowl or ven'son, and his errand speeds.But faster far and more than all the restA noble cause, which none who bears a sparkOf public virtue, ever wish'd removed,Works the deplor'd and mischievous effect.'Tis universal soldiership has stabb'dThe heart of merit in the meaner class.Arms through the vanity and brainless rage
Of those that bear them in whatever cause,Seem most at variance with all moral good,And incompatible with serious thought.The clown, the child of nature, without guile,Blest with an insant's ignorance of allBut his own simple pleasures, now and thenA wrestling match, a foot-race, or a fair,Is ballotted, and trembles at the news.Sheepish he doffs his hat, and mumbling swearsA Bible-oath to be whate'er they please,To do he knows not what. The task perform'd,That instant he becomes the serjeant's care,His pupil, and his torment, and his jest.His aukward gait, his introverted toes,Bent knees, round shoulders, and dejected looks,Procure him many a curse. By slow degrees,Unapt to learn and formed of stubborn stuff,He yet by slow degrees puts off himself,Grows conscious of a change, and likes it well.He stands erect, his slouch becomes a walk,
He steps right onward, martial in his airHis form and movement; is as smart aboveAs meal and larded locks can make him; wearsHis hat or his plumed helmet with a grace,And his three years of heroship expired,Returns indignant to the slighted plough.He hates the field in which no fife or drumAttends him, drives his cattle to a march,And sighs for the smart comrades he has left.'Twere well if his exterior change were all—But with his clumsy port the wretch has lostHis ignorance and harmless manners too.To swear, to game, to drink, to shew at homeBy lewdness, idleness, and sabbath-breach,The great proficiency he made abroad,T' astonish and to grieve his gazing friends,To break some maiden's and his mother's heart,To be a pest where he was useful once,Are his sole aim, and all his glory now.Man in society is like a flow'rBown in its native bed. 'Tis there aloneHis faculties expanded in full bloomShine out, there only reach their proper use.But man associated and leagued with manBy regal warrant, or self-joined by bondFor interest-sake, or swarming into clansBeneath one head for purposes of war,Like flow'rs selected from the rest, and boundAnd bundled close to fill some crowded vase,Fades rapidly, and by compression marredContracts defilement not to be endured.Hence charter'd boroughs are such public plagues,And burghers, men immaculate perhapsIn all their private functions, once combinedBecome a loathsome body, only fitFor dissolution, hurtful to the main.Hence merchants, unimpeachable of sinAgainst the charities of domestic life,Incorporated, seem at once to Iose
Their nature, and disclaiming all regardFor mercy and the common rights of man,Build factories with blood, conducting tradeAt the sword's point, and dying the white robeOf innocent commercial justice red.Hence too the field of glory, as the worldMisdeems it, dazzled by its bright array,With all the majesty of its thund'ring pomp,Enchanting music and immortal wreaths,Is but a school where thoughtlessness is taughtOn principle, where foppery atonesFor folly, gallantry for ev'ry vice.But slighted as it is, and by the greatAbandon'd, and, which still I more regret,Infected with the manners and the modesIt knew not once, the country wins me still.I never fram'd a wish, or form'd a planThat flatter'd me with hopes of earthly bliss,But there I laid the scene. There early stray'd
My fancy, 'ere yet liberty of choiceHad found me, or the hope of being free.My very dreams were rural, rural tooThe first-born efforts of my youthful museSportive, and jingling her poetic bells'Ere yet her ear was mistress of their pow'rs.No bard could please me but whose lyre was tunedTo Nature's praises. Heroes and their featsFatigued me, never weary of the pipeOf Tityrus, assembling as he sangThe rustic throng beneath his fav'rite beech.Then Milton had indeed a poet's charms.New to my taste, his Paradise surpass'dThe struggling efforts of my boyish tongueTo speak its excellence; I danced for joy.I marvel'd much that at so ripe an ageAs twice sev'n years, his beauties had then firstEngaged my wonder, and admiring stillAnd still admiring, with regret supposedThe joy half lost because not sooner found.
Thee too enamour'd of the life I loved,Pathetic in its praise, in its pursuitDetermined, and possessing it at lastWith transports such as favor'd lovers feel,I studied, prized, and wished that I had knownIngenious Cowley! and though now, reclaimed,By modern lights from an erroneous taste,I cannot but lament thy splendid witEntangled in the cobwebs of the schools,I still revere thee, courtly though retired,Though stretch'd at ease in Chertsey's silent bow'rsNot unemploy'd, and finding rich amendsFor a lost world in solitude and verse.'Tis born with all. The love of Nature's worksIs an ingredient in the compound, man,Infused at the creation of the kind.And though th' Almighty Maker, has throughoutDiscriminated each from each, by strokesAnd touches of his hand with so much artDiversified, that two were never found
Twins at all points—yet this obtains in all,That all discern a beauty in his worksAnd all can taste them. Minds that have been form'dAnd tutor'd, with a relish more exact,But none without some relish, none unmoved.It is a flame that dies not even thereWhere nothing feeds it. Neither business, crowds,Nor habits of luxurious city-life,Whatever else they smother of true worthIn human bosoms, quench it or abate.The villas with which London stands begirtLike a swarth Indian with his belt of beads,Prove it. A breath of unadult'rate air,The glimpse of a green pasture, how they cheerThe citizen, and brace his languid frame!Ev'n in the stifling bosom of the town,A garden in which nothing thrives, has charmsThat sooth the rich possessor; much consoledThat here and there some sprigs of mournful mint,Of nightshade or valerian grace the well
He cultivates. These serve him with a hintThat Nature lives, that sight-refreshing greenIs still the liv'ry she delights to wear,Though sickly samples of th' exub'rant whole.What are the casements lined with creeping herbs,The prouder sashes fronted with a rangeOf orange, myrtle, or the fragrant weedThe Frenchman's Mignonette. darling? are they not all proofsThat man immured in cities, still retainsHis inborn inextinguishable thirstOf rural scenes, compensating his lossBy supplemental shifts, the best he may?The most unfurnished with the means of life,And they that never pass their brick-wall boundsTo range the fields and treat their lungs with air,Yet feel the burning instinct: over-headSuspend their crazy boxes planted thickAnd water'd duely. There the pitcher stands
A fragment, and the spoutless tea-pot there;Sad witnesses how close-pent man regretsThe country, with what ardour he contrivesA peep at nature, when he can no more.Hail therefore patroness of health and easeAnd contemplation, heart-consoling joysAnd harmless pleasures in the throng'd abodeOf multitudes unknown, hail rural life!Address himself who will to the pursuitOf honors or emolument or fame,I shall not add myself to such a chace,Thwart his attempts, or envy his success.Some must be great. Great offices will haveGreat talents. And God gives to ev'ry manThe virtue, temper, understanding, taste,That lifts him into life, and lets him fallJust in the niche he was ordain'd to fill.To the deliv'rer of an injured landHe gives a tongue t' enlarge upon, an heart
To feel, and courage to redress her wrongs;To monarchs dignity, to judges sense,To artists ingenuity and skill;To me an unambitious mind, contentIn the low vale of life, that early feltA wish for ease and leisure, and 'ere longFound here that leisure and that ease I wish'd.ARGUMENT of the FIFTH BOOK.A frosty morning.—The foddering of cattle.—the woodman

While the cloudsThat crowd away before the driving wind,More ardent as the disk emerges more,Resemble most some city in a blaze,Seen through the leafless wood. His slanting raySlides ineffectual down the snowy vale,And tinging all with his own rosy hue,From ev'ry herb and ev'ry spiry bladeStretches a length of shadow o'er the field.Mine, spindling into longitude immense,
In spite of gravity and sage remarkThat I myself am but a fleeting shade,Provokes me to a smile. With eye askanceI view the muscular proportioned limbTransformed to a lean shank. The shapeless pairAs they designed to mock me, at my sideTake step for step, and as I near approachThe cottage, walk along the plaister'd wallPrepost'rous sight! the legs without the man.The verdure of the plain lies buried deepBeneath the dazzling deluge, and the bentsAnd coarser grass upspearing o'er the rest,Of late unsightly and unseen, now shineConspicuous, and in bright apparel cladAnd fledged with icy feathers, nod superb.The cattle mourn in corners where the fenceScreens them, and seem half petrified to sleepIn unrecumbent sadness. There they waitTheir wonted fodder, not like hungr'ing manFretfull if unsupplied, but silent, meek,
And patient of the slow-paced swain's delay.He from the stack carves out th' accustomed load,Deep-plunging and again deep plunging oftHis broad keen knife into the solid mass.Smooth as a wall the upright remnant stands,With such undeviating and even forceHe severs it away. No needless care,Lest storms should overset the leaning pileDeciduous, or its own unbalanced weight.Forth goes the woodman leaving unconcernedThe cheerfull haunts of man, to wield the axeAnd drive the wedge in yonder forest drear,From morn to eve his solitary task.Shaggy and lean and shrew'd, with pointed earsAnd tail cropp'd short, half lurcher and half curHis dog attends him. Close behind his heelNow creeps he slow, and now with many a friskWide-scampering snatches up the drifted snowWith iv'ry teeth, or ploughs it with his snout;Then shakes his powder'd coat and barks for joy.
Heedless of all his pranks the sturdy churlMoves right toward the mark. Nor stops for aught.But now and then with pressure of his thumbT' adjust the fragrant charge of a short tubeThat fumes beneath his nose. The trailing cloudStreams far behind him, scenting all the air.Now from the roost or from the neighb'ring pale,Where diligent to catch the first faint gleamOf smiling day, they gossipp'd side by side,Come trooping at the housewife's well-known callThe feather'd tribes domestic. Half on wingAnd half on foot, they brush the fleecy floodConscious, and fearful of too deep a plunge.The sparrows peep, and quit the shelt'ring eavesTo seize the fair occasion. Well they eyeThe scatter'd grain, and thievishly resolvedT' escape th' impending famine, often scaredAs oft return, a pert voracious kind.Clean riddance quickly made, one only careRemains to each, the search of sunny nook,
Or shed impervious to the blast. Resign'dTo sad necessity the cock foregoesHis wonted strut, and wading at their headWith well-considered steps, seems to resentHis alter'd gait and stateliness retrenched.How find the myriads that in summer cheerThe hills and vallies with their ceaseless songsDue sustenance, or where subsist they now?Earth yields them nought: the imprison'd worm is safeBeneath the frozen clod; all seeds of herbsLie covered close, and berry-bearing thornsThat feed the thrush (whatever some suppose)Afford the smaller minstrels no supply.The long protracted rigor of the yearThins all their num'rous flocks. In chinks and holesTen thousand seek an unmolested endAs instinct prompts, self buried 'ere they die.The very rooks and daws forsake the fields,Where neither grub nor root nor earth-nut nowRepays their labor more; and perch'd aloft
By the way-side, or stalking in the path,Lean pensioners upon the trav'llers track,Pick up their nauscous dole, though sweet to them,Of voided pulse or half digested grain.The streams are lost amid the splendid blankO'erwhelming all distinction. On the floodIndurated and fixt the snowy weightLies undissolved, while silently beneathAnd unperceived the current steals away.Not so, where scornful of a check it leapsThe mill-dam, dashes on the wrestless wheel,And wantons in the pebbly gulph below.No frost can bind it there. Its utmost forceCan but arrest the light and smokey mistThat in its fall the liquid sheet throws wide.And see where it has hung th' embroidered banksWith forms so various, that no pow'rs of art,The pencil or the pen, may trace the scene!Here glitt'ring turrets rise, upbearing high(Fantastic misarrangement) on the roof
Large growth of what may seem the sparkling treesAnd shrubs of fairy land. The chrystal dropsThat trickle down the branches, fast congeal'dShoot into pillars of pellucid length,And prop the pile they but adorned before.Here grotto within grotto safe defiesThe sun-beam. There imboss'd and fretted wildThe growing wonder takes a thousand shapesCapricious, in which fancy seeks in vainThe likeness of some object seen before.Thus nature works as if to mock at art,And in defiance of her rival pow'rs;By these fortuitous and random strokesPerforming such inimitable featsAs she with all her rules can never reach.Less worthy of applause though more admired,Because a novelty, the work of man,Imperial mistress of the fur-clad Russ!Thy most magnificent and mighty freak,The wonder of the North. No forest fell
When thou would'st build: no quarry sent its storesT' enrich thy walls. But thou didst hew the floods,And make thy marble of the glassy wave.In such a palace Aristaeus foundCyrene, when he bore the plaintive taleOf his lost bees to her maternal ear.In such a palace poetry might placeThe armoury of winter, where his troopsThe gloomy clouds find weapons, arro'wy sleetSkin-piercing volley, blossom-bruising hail,And snow that often blinds the trav'ller's course,And wraps him in an unexpected tomb.Silently as a dream the fabric rose.No sound of hammer or of saw was there.Ice upon ice, the well-adjusted partsWere soon conjoined, nor other cement ask'dThan water interfused to make them one.Lamps gracefully disposed and of all huesIllumined ev'ry side. A wat'ry lightGleamed through the clear transparency, that seemed
Another moon new-risen, or meteor fall'nFrom heav'n to earth, of lambent flame serene.So stood the brittle prodigy, though smoothAnd slipp'ry the materials, yet frost-boundFirm as a rock. Nor wanted aught withinThat royal residence might well befit,For grandeur or for use. Long wavy wreathsOf flow'rs that feared no enemy but warmth,Blushed on the pannels. Mirrour needed noneWhere all was vitreous, but in order dueConvivial table and commodious seat(What seemed at least commodious seat) were there,Sofa and couch and high-built throne august.The same lubricity was found in all,And all was moist to the warm touch, a sceneOf evanescent glory, once a stream,And soon to slide into a stream again.Alas! twas but a mortifying strokeOf undesigned severity, that glanced,(Made by a monarch) on her own estate,
On human grandeur and the courts of kings.'Twas transient in its nature, as in show'Twas durable. As worthless as it seemedIntrinsically precious. To the footTreach'rous and false, it smiled and it was cold.Great princes have great play-things. Some have playedAt hewing mountains into men, and someAt building human wonders mountain-high.Some have amused the dull sad years of life,Life spent in indolence, and therefore sad,With schemes of monumental fame, and soughtBy pyramids and mausolaean pomp,Short-lived themselves, t' immortalize their bones.Some seek diversion in the tented field,And make the sorrows of mankind their sport.But war's a game, which were their subjects wise,King's should not play at. Nations would do wellT' extort their truncheons from the puny handsOf heroes, whose infirm and baby minds
Are gratified with mischief, and who spoilBecause men suffer it, their toy the world.When Babel was confounded, and the greatConfed'racy of projectors wild and vainWas split into diversity of tongues,Then, as a shépherd separates his flock,These to the upland, to the valley those,God drave asunder and assigned their lotTo all the nations. Ample was the boonHe gave them, in its distribution fairAnd equal, and he bade them dwell in peace.Peace was awhile their care. They plough'd and sow'dAnd reap'd their plenty without grudge or strife.But violence can never longer sleepThan human passions please. In ev'ry heartAre sown the sparks that kindle fiery war,Occasion needs but fan them, and they blaze.Cain had already shed a brother's blood;The deluge wash'd it out; but left unquenched
The seeds of murther in the breast of man.Soon, by a righteous judgment, in the lineOf his descending progeny was foundThe first artificer of death; the shrew'dContriver who first sweated at the forge,And forced the blunt and yet unblooded steelTo a keen edge, and made it bright for war.Him Tubal named, the Vulcan of old times,The sword and faulchion their inventor claim,And the first smith was the first murd'rer's son.His art survived the waters; and 'ere longWhen man was multiplied and spread abroadIn tribes and clans, and had begun to callThese meadows and that range of hills his own,The tasted sweets of property begatDesire of more; and industry in someTo improve and cultivate their just demesne,Made others covet what they saw so fair.Thus wars began on earth. These fought for spoil,And those in self-defence. Savage at first
The onset, and irregular. At lengthOne eminent above the rest, for strength,For stratagem or courage, or for all,Was chosen leader. Him they served in war,And him in peace for sake of warlike deedsRev'renced no less. Who could with him compare?Or who so worthy to controul themselvesAs he whose prowess had subdued their foes?Thus war affording field for the displayOf virtue, made one chief, whom times of peace,Which have their exigencies too, and callFor skill in government, at length made king.King was a name too proud for man to wearWith modesty and meekness, and the crown,So dazzling in their eyes who set it on,Was sure t' intoxicate the brows it bound.It is the abject property of most,That being parcel of the common mass,And destitute of means to raise themselves,They sink and settle lower than they need.
They know not what it is to feel withinA comprehensive faculty that graspsGreat purposes with ease, that turns and wieldsAlmost without an effort, plans too vastFor their conception, which they cannot move.Conscious of impotence they soon grow drunkWith gazing, when they see an able manStep forth to notice; and besotted thusBuild him a pedestal and say, stand there,And be our admiration and our praise.They roll themselves before him in the dust,Then most deserving in their own accountWhen most extravagant in his applause,As if exalting him they raised themselves.Thus by degrees self-cheated of their foundAnd sober judgment that he is but man,They demi-deify and fume him soThat in due season he forgets it too.Inflated and astrut with self-conceitHe gulps the windy diet, and 'ere long
Adopting their mistake, profoundly thinksThe world was made in vain if not for him.Thenceforth they are his cattle. Drudges bornTo bear his burthens, drawing in his gearsAnd sweating in his service. His capriceBecomes the soul that animates them all.He deems a thousand or ten thousand livesSpent in the purchase of renown for himAn easy reck'ning, and they think the same.Thus kings were first invented, and thus kingsWere burnished into heroes, and becameThe arbiters of this terraqueous swamp,Storks among frogs, that have but croak'd and died.Strange that such folly as lifts bloated manTo eminence fit only for a God,Should ever drivel out of human lipsEv'n in the cradled weakness of the world!Still stranger much, that when at length mankindHad reached the sinewy firmness of their youth,And could discriminate and argue well
On subjects more mysterious, they were yetBabes in the cause of freedom, and should fearAnd quake before the Gods themselves had made.But above measure strange, that neither proofOf sad experience, nor examples setBy some whose patriot virtue has prevailed,Can even now, when they are grown matuteIn wisdom, and with philosophic deepsFamiliar, serve t' emancipate the rest!Such dupes are men to custom, and so proneTo rev'rence what is ancient and can pleadA course of long observance for its use,That even servitude the worst of ills,Because deliver'd down from sire to son,Is kept and guarded as a sacred thing.But is it fit, or can it bear the shockOf rational discussion, that a manCompounded and made up like other menOf elements tumultuous, in whom lustAnd folly in as ample measure meet
As in the bosoms of the slaves he rules,Should be a despot absolute, and boastHimself the only freeman of his land?Should when he pleases, and on whom he willWage war, with any or with no pretenceOf provocation giv'n or wrong sustained,And force the beggarly last doit, by meansThat his own humour dictates, from the clutchOf poverty, that thus he may procureHis thousands weary of penurious lifeA splendid opportunity to die?Say ye, who (with less prudence than of oldJotham ascribed to his assembled treesIn politic convention) put your trustI' th' shadow of a bramble, and reclinedIn fancied peace beneath his dang'rous branch,Rejoice in him and celebrate his sway,Where find ye passive fortitude? Whence springsYour self-denying zeal that holds it goodTo stroke the prickly grievance, and to hang
His thorns with streamers of continual praise?We too are friends to loyalty. We loveThe king who loves the law; respects his boundsAnd reigns content within them. Him we serveFreely and with delight, who leaves us free.But recollecting still that he is man,We trust him not too far. King, though he be,And king in England too, he may be weakAnd vain enough to be ambitious still,May exercise amiss his proper pow'rs,Or covet more than freemen chuse to grant:Beyond that mark is treason. He is ours,T' administer, to guard, t' adorn the state,But not to warp or change it. We are his,To serve him nobly in the common causeTrue to the death, but not to be his slaves.Mark now the diff'rence, ye that boast your loveOf kings, between your loyalty and ours.We love the man. The paultry pageant you.We the chief patron of the Commonwealth;
You the regardless author of its woes.We for the sake of liberty, a king;You chains and bondage for a tyrant's sake.Our love is principle, and has its rootIn reason, is judicious, manly, free.Yours, a blind instinct, crouches to the rod,And licks the foot that treads it in the dust.Were king-ship as true treasure as it seems,Sterling, and worthy of a wise man's wish,I would not be a king to be belovedCauseless, and daubed with undiscerning praise,Where love is mere attachment to the throne,Not to the man who fills it as he ought.Whose freedom is by suff'rance, and at willOf a superior, he is never free.Who lives and is not weary of a life.Exposed to manacles, deserves them well.The state that strives for liberty, though foiledAnd forced t' abandon what she bravely sought,
Deserves at least applause for her attempt,And pity for her loss. But that's a causeNot often unsuccessful; pow'r usurp'dIs weakness when oppos'd; conscious of wrong'Tis pusillanimous and prone to flight.But slaves that once conceive the glowing thoughtOf freedom, in that hope itself possessAll that the contest calls for; spirit, strength,The scorn of danger, and united heartsThe surest presage of the good they seek.The author hopes that he shall not be censured for unnecessary warmth upon so interesting a subject. He is aware that it is become almost fashionable to stigmatize such sentiments as no better than empty declamation. But it is an ill symptom, and peculiar to modern times.Then shame to manhood, and opprobrious moreTo France, than all her losses and defeatsOld or of later date, by sea or land,
Her house of bondage worse than that of oldWhich God avenged on Pharaoh—the Bastile.Ye horrid tow'rs, th' abode of broken hearts,Ye dungeons and ye cages of despair,That monarchs have supplied from age to ageWith music such as suits their sov'reign ears,The sighs and groans of miserable men!There's not an English heart that would not leapTo hear that ye were fall'n at last, to knowThat ev'n our enemies, so oft employedIn forging chains for us, themselves were free.For he that values liberty, confinesHis zeal for her predominance withinNo narrow bounds; her cause engages himWherever pleaded. 'Tis the cause of man.There dwell the most forlorn of human kindImmured though unaccused, condemn'd untried,Cruelly spared, and hopeless of escape.There like the visionary emblem seenBy him of Babylon, life stands a stump,
And filletted about with hoops of brass,Still lives, though all its pleasant boughs are gone,To count the hour-bell and expect no change;And ever as the sullen sound is heard,Still to reflect that though a joyless noteTo him whose moments all have one dull pace,Ten thousand rovers in the world at largeAccount it music; that it summons someTo theatre or jocund feast or ball;The wearied hireling finds it a releaseFrom labor, and the lover that has chidIts long delay, feels ev'ry welcome strokeUpon his heart-strings trembliug with delight—To fly for refuge from distracting thoughtTo such amusements as ingenious woeContrives, hard-shifting and without her tools—To read engraven on the mouldy wallsIn stagg'ring types, his predecessors tale,A sad memorial, and subjoin his own—To turn purveyor to an overgorged
And bloated spider, till the pamper'd pestIs made familiar, watches his approach,Comes at his call and serves him for a friend—To wear out time in numb'ring to and froThe studs that thick emboss his iron door,Then downward and then upward, then aflantAnd then alternate, with a sickly hopeBy dint of change to give his tasteless taskSome relish, till the sum exactly foundIn all directions, he begins again—Oh comfortless existence! hemm'd aroundWith woes, which who that suffers, would not kneelAnd beg for exile, or the pangs of death?That man should thus encroach on fellow man,Abridge him of his just and native rights,Eradicate him, tear him from his holdUpon th' endearments of domestic lifeAnd social, nip his fruitfulness and use,And doom him for perhaps an heedless wordTo barrenness and solitude and tears,
Moves indignation. Makes the name of king,(Of king whom such prerogative can please)As dreadful as the Manichean God,Adored through fear, strong only to destroy.'Tis liberty alone that gives the flow'rOf fleeting life its lustre and perfume,And we are weeds without it. All constraint,Except what wisdom lays on evil men,Is evil; hurts the faculties, impedesTheir progress in the road of science; blindsThe eye sight of discov'ry, and begetsIn those that suffer it, a sordid mindBestial, a meagre intellect, unfitTo to be the tenant of man's noble form.Thee therefore still, blame-worthy as thou art,With all thy lose of empire, and though squeezedBy public exigence 'till annual foodFails for the craving hunger of the state,Thee I account still happy, and the chief
Among the nations, seeing thou art free!My native nook of earth! thy clime is rude,Replete with vapours, and disposes muchAll hearts to sadness, and none more than mine;Thine unadult'rate manners are less softAnd plausible than social life requires,And thou hast need of discipline and artTo give thee what politer France receivesFrom Nature's bounty—that humane addressAnd sweetness, without which no pleasure isIn converse, either starved by cold reserve,Or flush'd with fierce dispute, a senseless brawl;Yet being free, I love thee. For the sakeOf that one feature, can be well content,Disgraced as thou hast been, poor as thou art,To seek no sublunary rest beside.But once enslaved, farewell! I could endureChains no where patiently, and chains at homeWhere I am free by birthright, not at all.Then what were left of roughness in the grain
Of British natures, wanting its excuseThat it belongs to freemen, would disgustAnd shock me. I should then with double painFeel all the rigor of thy fickle clime,And if I must bewail the blessing lostFor which our Hampdens and our Sidney's bled,I would at least bewail it under skiesMilder, among a people less austere,In scenes which having never known me freeWould not reproach me with the loss I felt.Do I forebode impossible events,And tremble at vain dreams? Heav'n grant I may!But th' age of virtuous politics is past,And we are deep in that of cold pretence.Patriots are grown too shrewd to be sincere,And we too wise to trust them. He that takesDeep in his soft credulity the stampDesigned by loud declaimers on the partOf liberty, themselves the slaves of lust,Incurs derision for his easy faith
And lack of knowledge, and with cause enough.For when was public virtue to be foundWhere private was not? can he love the wholeWho loves no part? He be a nation's friendWho is, in truth, the friend of no man there?Can he be strenuous in his country's cause,Who slights the charities for whose dear sakeThat country, if at all, must be beloved?'Tis therefore, sober and good men are sadFor England's glory, seeing it wax paleAnd sickly, while her champions wear their heartsSo loose to private duty, that no brainHealthful and undisturbed by factious fumes,Can dream them trusty to the gen'ral weal.Such were not they of old, whose temper'd bladesDispersed the shackles of usurp'd controul,And hew'd them link from link. Then Albion's sonsWere sons indeed. They felt a filial heartBeat high within them at a mother's wrongs,And shining each in his domestic sphere,
Shone brighter still once call'd to public view.'Tis therefore, many whose sequester'd lotForbids their interference, looking onAnticipate perforce some dire event;And seeing the old castle of the stateThat promised once more firmness, so assail'dThat all its tempest-beaten turrets shake,Stand motionless expectants of its fall.All has its date below. The fatal hourWas register'd in heaven 'ere time began.We turn to dust, and all our mightiest worksDie too. The deep foundations that we lay,Time ploughs them up, and not a trace remains,We build with what we deem eternal rock,A distant age asks where the fabric stood,And in the dust sifted and search'd in vain,The undiscoverable secret sleeps.But there is yet a liberty unsungBy poets, and by senators unpraised,
Which monarchs cannot grant, nor all the powerOf earth and hell confed'rate take away.A liberty, which persecution, fraud,Oppression, prisons, have no power to bind,Which whoso tastes can be enslaved no more.'Tis liberty of heart, derived from heav'n,Bought with HIS blood who gave it to mankind,And seal'd with the same token. It is heldBy charter, and that charter sanction'd sureBy th' unimpeachable and awful oathAnd promise of a God. His other giftsAll bear the royal stamp that speaks them his,And are august, but this transcends them all,His other works, this visible displayOf all-creating energy and might,Are grand no doubt, and worthy of the wordThat finding an interminable spaceUnoccupied, has filled the void so well,And made so sparkling what was dark before.But these are not his glory. Man, 'tis true,
Smit with the beauty of so fair a scene,Might well suppose th' artificer divineMeant it eternal, had he not himselfPronounced it transient glorious as it is,And still designing a more glorious far,Doom'd it, as insufficient for his praise.These therefore are occasional and pass.Form'd for the confutation of the foolWhose lying heart disputes against a God,That office served, they must be swept away.Not so the labours of his love. They shineIn other heav'ns than these that we behold,And fade not. There is paradise that fearsNo forfeiture, and of its fruits he sendsLarge prelibation oft to saints below.Of these the first in order, and the pledgeAnd confident assurance of the restIs liberty. A flight into his arms'Ere yet mortality's fine threads give way,
A clear escape from tyrannizing lust,And full immunity from penal woe.Chains are the portion of revolted man,Stripes and a dungeon; and his body servesThe triple purpose. In that sickly, foul,Opprobrious residence, he finds them all.Propense his heart to idols, he is heldIn silly dotage on created thingsCareless of their Creator. And that lowAnd sordid gravitation of his pow'rsTo a vile clod, so draws him, with such forceResistless from the center he should seek,That he at last forgets it. All his hopesTend downward, his ambition is to sink,To reach a depth profounder still, and stillProfounder, in the fathomless abyssOf folly, plunging in pursuit of death.But 'ere he gain the comfortless reposeHe seeks, an acquiescence of his soul
In heav'n-renouncing exile, he endures—What does he not? from lusts oppos'd in vain,And self-reproaching conscience. He foreseesThe fatal issue to his health, fame, peace,Fortune and dignity; the loss of allThat can enoble man, and make frail lifeShort as it is, supportable. Still worse,Far worse than all the plagues with which his sinsInfect his happiest moments, he forebodesAges of hopeless misery. Future death,And death still future. Not an hasty strokeLike that which sends him to the dusty grave,But unrepealable enduring death.Scripture is still a trumpet to his fears;What none can prove a forg'ry, may be true,What none but bad men wish exploded, must.That scruple checks him. Riot is not loudNor drunk enough to drown it. In the midstOf laughter his compunctions are sincere,And he abhors the jest by which he shines.
Remorse begets reform. His master-lustFalls first before his resolute rebuke,And seems dethroned and vanquish'd. Peace ensues,But spurious and short-liv'd, the puny childOf self-congratulating pride, begotOn fancied Innocence. Again he falls,And fights again; but finds his best essayA presage ominous, portending stillIts own dishonor by a worse relapse.Till Nature, unavailing Nature foiledSo oft, and wearied in the vain attempt,Scoffs at her own performance. Reason nowTakes part with appetite, and pleads the cause,Perversely, which of late she so condemn'd;With shallow shifts and old devices, wornAnd tatter'd in the service of debauch,Cov'ring his shame from his offended sight."Hath God indeed giv'n appetites to man,"And stored the earth so plenteously with means
"To gratify the hunger of his wish,"And doth he reprobate and will he damn"The use of his own bounty? making first"So frail a kind, and then enacting laws"So strict, that less than perfect must despair?"Falsehood! which whoso but suspects of truth,"Dishonors God, and makes a slave of man."Do they themselves, who undertake for hire"The teacher's office, and dispense at large"Their weekly dole of edifying strains,"Attend to their own music? have they faith"In what with such solemnity of tone"And gesture they propound to our belief?"Nay—conduct hath the loudest tongue. The voice"Is but an instrument on which the priest"May play what tune he pleases. In the deed,"The unequivocal authentic deed"We find sound argument, we read the heart.Such reas'nings (if that name must needs belongT' excuses in which reason has no part)
Serve to compose a spirit well inclinedTo live on terms of amity with vice,And sin without disturbance. Often urged(As often as libidinous discourseExhausted, he resorts to solemn themesOf theological and grave import)They gain at last his unreserved assent.Till harden'd his heart's temper in the forgeOf lust, and on the anvil of despair,He slights the strokes of conscience. Nothing moves,Or nothing much, his constancy in ill,Vain tamp'ring has but foster'd his disease,'Tis desp'rate, and he sleeps the sleep of death.Haste now, philosopher, and set him free.Charm the deaf serpent wisely. Make him hearOf rectitude and fitness; moral truthHow lovely, and the moral-sense how sureConsulted and obey'd, to guide his stepsDirectly to the FIRST AND ONLY FAIR.Spare not in such a cause. Spend all the pow'rs
Of rant and rhapsody in virtue's praise,Be most sublimely good, verbosely grand,And with poetic trappings grace thy proseTill it out-mantle all the pride of verse.—Ah, tinkling cymbal and high-sounding brassSmitten in vain! such music cannot charmTh' eclipse that intercepts truth's heav'nly beam,And chills and darkens a wide-wand'ring soul.The still small voice is wanted. He must speakWhose word leaps forth at once to its effect,Who calls for things that are not, and they come.Grace makes the slave a freeman. 'Tis a changeThat turns to ridicule the turgid speechAnd stately tone of moralists, who boast,As if like him of fabulous renownThey had indeed ability to smoothThe shag of savage nature, and were eachAn Orpheus and omnipotent in song.But transformation of apostate man
From fool to wise, from earthly to divine,Is work for Him that made him. He alone,And he by means in philosophic eyesTrivial and worthy of disdain, atchievesThe wonder; humanizing what is bruteIn the lost kind, extracting from the lipsOf asps their venom, overpow'ring strengthBy weakness, and hostility by love.Patriots have toiled, and in their country's causeBled nobly, and their deeds, as they deserve,Receive proud recompense. We give in chargeTheir names to the sweet lyre. Th' historic muse,Proud of the treasure, marches with it downTo latest times; and sculpture in her turn,Gives bond in stone and ever-during brass,To guard them, and t' immortalize her trust.But fairer wreaths are due, though never paid,To those who posted at the shrine of truth,Have fall'n in her defence. A patriot's bloodWell spent in such a strife may earn indeed
And for a time insure to his loved landThe sweets of liberty and equal laws;But martyrs struggle for a brighter prize,And win it with more pain. Their blood is shedIn confirmation of the noblest claim,Our claim to feed upon immortal truth,To walk with God, to be divinely free,To soar, and to anticipate the skies.Yet few remember them. They lived unknownTill persecution dragg'd them into fameAnd chased them up to heaven. Their ashes flew—No marble tells us whither. With their namesNo bard embalms and sanctifies his song,And History, so warm on meaner themes,Is cold on this. She execrates indeedThe tyranny that doom'd them to the fire,But gives the glorious suff'rers little praise.See Hume.He is the freeman whom the truth makes free,And all are slaves beside. There's not a chainThat hellish foes confed'rate for his harmCan wind around him, but he casts it offWith as much ease as Samson his green wyths.He looks abroad into the varied fieldOf Nature, and though poor perhaps, comparedWith those whose mansions glitter in his sight,Calls the delightful scen'ry all his own.His are the mountains, and the vallies his,And the resplendent rivers. His t' enjoyWith a propriety that none can feel,But who with filial confidence inspiredCan lift to heav'n an unpresumptuous eye,And smiling say—my father made them all.Are they not his by a peculiar right,And by an emphasis of int'rest his,Whose eye they fill with tears of holy joy,Whose heart with praise, and whose exalted mindWith worthy thoughts of that unwearied love
That plann'd, and built, and still upholds a worldSo cloathed with beauty, for rebellious man?Yes—ye may fill your garners, ye that reapThe loaded soil, and ye may waste much goodIn senseless riot; but ye will not findIn feast or in the chace, in song or danceA liberty like his, who unimpeach'dOf usurpation and to no man's wrong,Appropriates nature as his father's work,And has a richer use of yours, than you.He is indeed a freeman. Free by birthOf no mean city, plann'd or 'ere the hillsWere built, the fountains open'd, or the sea,With all his roaring multitude of waves.His freedom is the same in ev'ry state,And no condition of this changeful lifeSo manifold in cares, whose ev'ry dayBrings its own evil with it, makes it less.For he has wings that neither sickness, pain,Nor penury, can cripple or confine.
No nook so narrow but he spreads them thereWith ease, and is at large. Th' oppressor holdsHis body bound, but knows not what a rangeHis spirit takes unconscious of a chain,And that to bind him is a vain attemptWhom God delights in, and in whom he dwells.Acquaint thyself with God if thou would'st tasteHis works. Admitted once to his embrace,Thou shalt perceive that thou wast blind before;Thine eye shall be instructed, and thine heartMade pure, shall relish with divine delight'Till then unfelt, what hands divine have wrought.Brutes graze the mountain-top with faces proneAnd eyes intent upon the scanty herbIt yields them, or recumbent on its brow,Ruminate heedless of the scene outspreadBeneath, beyond, and stretching far awayFrom inland regions to the distant main.Man views it and admires, but rests content
With what he views. The landscape has his praise,But not its author. Unconcern'd who form'dThe paradise he sees, he finds it such,And such well-pleased to find it, asks no more.Not so the mind that has been touch'd from heav'n,And in the school of sacred wisdom taughtTo read his wonders, in whose thought the world,Fair as it is, existed 'ere it was.Not for its own sake merely, but for hisMuch more who fashioned it, he gives it praise;Praise that from earth resulting as it oughtTo earth's acknowledg'd sov'reign, finds at onceIts only just proprietor in Him.The soul that sees him, or receives sublimedNew faculties, or learns at least t' employMore worthily the pow'rs she own'd before;Discerns in all things, what with stupid gazeOf ignorance till then she overlook'd,A ray of heav'nly light gilding all formsTerrestrial, in the vast and the minute
The unambiguous sootsteps of the GodWho gives its lustre to an insect's wing,And wheels his throne upon the rolling worlds.Much conversant with heav'n, she often holdsWith those fair ministers of light to manThat fill the skies nightly with silent pomp,Sweet conference. Enquires what strains were theyWith which heav'n rang, when ev'ry star, in hasteTo gratulate the new-created earth,Sent forth a voice, and all the sons of GodShouted for joy.—"Tell me, ye shining hosts"That navigate a sea that knows no storms"Beneath a vault unsullied with a cloud,"If from your elevation, whence ye view"Distinctly scenes invisible to man,"And systems of whose birth no tidings yet"Have reach'd this nether world, ye spy a race"Favor'd as our's, transgressors from the womb"And hasting to a grave, yet doom'd to rise,"And to possefs a brighter heav'n than yours?
"As one who long detain'd on foreign shores"Pants to return, and when he sees afar"His country's weather-bleach'd and batter'd rocks"From the green wave emerging, darts an eye"Radiant with joy towards the happy land;"So I with animated hopes behold"And many an aching wish, your beamy fires,"That shew like beacons in the blue abyss"Ordain'd to guide th' embodied spirit home"From toilsome life to never-ending rest."Love kindles as I gaze. I feel desires"That give assurance of their own success,"And that infused from heav'n, must thither tend."So reads he nature whom the lamp of truthIlluminates. Thy lamp, mysterious word!Which whoso sees, no longer wanders lostWith intellects bemazed in endless doubt,But runs the road of wisdom. Thou hast builtWith means that were not till by thee employ'd,
World's that had never been had'st thou in strengthBeen less, or less benevolent than strong.They are thy witnesses, who speak thy pow'rAnd goodness infinite, but speak in earsThat hear not, or receive not their report.In vain thy creatures testify of thee'Till thou proclaim thyself. Their's is indeedA teaching voice; but 'tis the praise of thineThat whom it teaches it makes prompt to learn,And with the boon gives talents for its use.'Till thou art heard, imaginations vainPossess the heart, and fables false as hellYet deemed oracular, lure down to deathThe uninform'd and heedless souls of men.We give to chance, blind chance, ourselves as blind,The glory of thy work, which yet appearsPerfect and unimpeachable of blame,Challenging human scrutiny, and provedThen skilful most when most severely judged.But chance is not; or is not where thou reign'st:
Thy providence forbids that fickle pow'r(If pow'r she be that works but to confound)To mix her wild vagaries with thy laws.Yet thus we doat, refusing while we canInstruction, and inventing to ourselvesGods such as guilt makes welcome, Gods that sleep,Or disregard our follies, or that sitAmused spectators of this bustling stage.Thee we reject, unable to abideThy purity, 'till pure as thou art pure,Made such by thee, we love thee for that causeFor which we shunn'd and hated thee before.Then we are free. Then liberty like dayBreaks on the soul, and by a flash from heav'nFires all the faculties with glorious joy.A voice is heard that mortal ears hear not'Till thou hast touch'd them; 'tis the voice of song,A loud Hosanna sent from all thy works,Which he that hears it with a shout repeats,And adds his rapture to the gen'ral praise.
In that blest moment, nature throwing wideHer veil opaque, discloses with a smileThe author of her beauties, who retiredBehind his own creation, works unseenBy the impure, and hears his pow'r denied.Thou art the source and centre of all minds,Their only point of rest, eternal word!From thee departing, they are lost and roveAt random, without honor, hope, or peace.From thee is all that sooths the life of man,His high endeavour, and his glad success,His strength to suffer and his will to serve.But oh thou bounteous giver of all good,Thou art of all thy gifts thyself the crown!Give what thou can'st, without thee we are poor,And with thee rich, take what thou wilt away.ARGUMENT of the SIXTH BOOK.Bells at a distance.—Their effect.—A fine noon in winter.

—Conclusion.BOOK VI.THE WINTER WALK AT NOON.THERE is in souls a sympathy with sounds,And as the mind is pitch'd the ear is pleas'dWith melting airs or martial, brisk or grave.Some chord in unison with what we hearIs touched within us, and the heart replies.How soft the music of those village bellsFalling at intervals upon the earIn cadence sweet! now dying all away,Now pealing loud again and louder still,Clear and sonorous as the gale comes on.With easy force it opens all the cells
Where mem'ry slept. Wherever I have heardA kindred melody, the scene recurs,And with it all its pleasures and its pains.Such comprehensive views the spirit takes,That in a few short moments I retrace(As in a map the voyager his course)The windings of my way through many years.Short as in retrospect the journey seems,It seem'd not always short; the rugged pathAnd prospect oft so dreary and forlornMoved many a sigh at its disheart'ning length.Yet feeling present evils, while the pastFaintly impress the mind, or not at all,How readily we wish time spent revoked,That we might try the ground again, where once(Through inexperience as we now perceive)We miss'd that happiness we might have found.Some friend is gone, perhaps his son's best friendA father, whose authority, in show
When most severe, and must'ring all its force,Was but the graver countenance of love.Whose favour like the clouds of spring, might low'rAnd utter now and then an awful voice,But had a blessing in its darkest frown,Threat'ning at once and nourishing the plant.We loved, but not enough the gentle handThat reared us. At a thoughtless age alluredBy ev'ry gilded folly, we renouncedHis shelt'ring side, and wilfully forewentThat converse which we now in vain regret.How gladly would the man recall to lifeThe boy's neglected sire! a mother too,That softer friend, perhaps more gladly stillMight he demand them at the gates of death.Sorrow has since they went subdued and tamedThe playful humour, he could now endure,(Himself grown sober in the vale of tears)And feel a parent's presence no restraint.But not to understand a treasure's worth
'Till time has stol'n away the slighted good,Is cause of half the poverty we feel,And makes the world the wilderness it is,The few that pray at all pray oft amiss,And seeking grace t' improve the prize they holdWould urge a wiser suit, than asking more.The night was winter in his roughest mood,The morning sharp and clear. But now at noonUpon the southern side of the slant hills,And where the woods fence off the northern blast,The season smiles resigning all its rageAnd has the warmth of May. The vault is blueWithout a cloud, and white without a speckThe dazzling splendour of the scene below.Again the harmony comes o'er the vale,And through the trees I view th' embattled tow'rWhence all the music. I again perceiveThe soothing influence of the wafted strains,And settle in soft musings as I tread
The walk still verdant under oaks and elms,Whose outspread branches overarch the glade.The roof though moveable through all its lengthAs the wind sways it, has yet well sufficed,And intercepting in their silent fallThe frequent flakes, has kept a path for me.No noise is here, or none that hinders thought.The red-breast warbles still, but is contentWith slender notes and more than half suppress'd.Pleased with his solitude, and flitting lightFrom spray to spray, where'er he rests he shakesFrom many a twig the pendent drops of ice,That tinkle in the wither'd leaves below.Stillness accompanied with sounds so softCharms more than silence. Meditation hereMay think down hours to moments. Here the heartMay give an useful lesson to the head,And learning wiser grow without his books.Knowledge and wisdom, far from being one,Have oft times no connexion. Knowledge dwells
In heads replete with thoughts of other men,Wisdom in minds attentive to their own.Knowledge, a rude unprofitable mass,The mere materials with which wisdom builds,'Till smooth'd and squared and fitted to its placeDoes but incumber whom it seems t' enrich.Knowledge is proud that he has learn'd so much,Wisdom is humble that he knows no more.Books are not seldom talismans and spellsBy which the magic art of shrewder witsHolds an unthinking multitude enthrall'd.Some to the fascination of a nameSurrender judgment hood-wink'd. Some the stileInfatuates, and through labyrinths and wildsOf error, leads them by a tune entranced.While sloth seduces more, too weak to bearThe insupportable fatigue of thought,And swallowing therefore without pause or choiceThe total grist unsifted, husks and all.But trees, and rivulets whose rapid course
Defies the check of winter, haunts of deer,And sheep-walks populous with bleating lambs,And lanes in which the primrose 'ere her timePeeps through the moss that cloaths the hawthorn root,Deceive no student. Wisdom there, and truth,Not shy as in the world, and to be wonBy slow solicitation, seize at onceThe roving thought, and fix it on themselves.What prodigies can pow'r divine performMore grand, than it produces year by year,And all in sight of inattentive man?Familiar with th' effect we slight the cause,And in the constancy of nature's course,The regular return of genial months,And renovation of a faded world,See nought to wonder at. Should God againAs once in Gibeon, interrupt the raceOf the undeviating and punctual sun,How would the world admire! but speaks it less
An agency divine, to make him knowHis moment when to sink and when to riseAge after age, than to arrest his course?All we behold is miracle, but seenSo duly, all is miracle in vain.Where now the vital energy that movedWhile summer was, the pure and subtle lymphThrough th' imperceptible maeandring veinsOf leaf and flow'r? It sleeps; and the icy touchOf unprolific winter has impress'dA cold stagnation on th' intestine tide.But let the months go round, a few short months,And all shall be restored. These naked shootsBarren as lances, among which the windMakes wintry music, sighing as it goes,Shall put their graceful foliage on again,And more aspiring and with ampler spreadShall boast new charms, and more than they have lost.Then, each in its peculiar honors clad,Shall publish even to the distant eye
Its family and tribe. Laburnum richIn streaming gold; syringa iv'ry-pure;The scented and the scentless rose; this redAnd of an humbler growth, the The Guelder-ro. other tall,And throwing up into the darkest gloomOf neighb'ring cypress or more sable yewHer silver globes, light as the foamy surfThat the wind severs from the broken wave.The lilac various in array, now white,Now sanguine, and her beauteous head now setWith purple spikes pyramidal, as ifStudious of ornament, yet unresolvedWhich hue she most approved, she chose them all.Copious of flow'rs the woodbine, pale and wan,But well compensating their sickly looksWith never-cloying odours, early and late.Hypericum all bloom, so thick a swarmOf flow'rs like flies cloathing her slender rodsThat scarce a leaf appears. Mezerion tooThough leafless well attired, and thick beset
With blushing wreaths investing ev'ry spray.Althaea with the purple eye, the broom,Yellow and bright as bullion unalloy'dHer blossoms, and luxuriant above allThe jasmine, throwing wide her elegant sweets,The deep dark green of whose unvarnish'd leafMakes more conspicuous, and illumines moreThe bright profusion of her scatter'd stars.—These have been, and these shall be in their day.And all this uniform uncoloured sceneShall be dismantled of its fleecy load,And flush into variety again.From dearth to plenty, and from death to life,Is Nature's progress when she lectures manIn heav'nly truth; evincing as she makesThe grand transition, that there lives and worksA soul in all things, and that soul is God.The beauties of the wilderness are his,That make so gay the solitary placeWhere no eye sees them. And the fairer forms
That cultivation glories in, are his.He sets the bright procession on its way,And marshals all the order of the year.He marks the bounds which winter may not pass,And blunts his pointed fury. In its caseRusset and rude, folds up the tender germUninjured, with inimitable art,And 'ere one flow'ry season fades and diesDesigns the blooming wonders of the next.Some say that in the origin of thingsWhen all creation started into birth,The infant elements received a lawFrom which they swerve not since. That under forceOf that controuling ordinance they move,And need not his immediate hand, who firstPrescribed their course, to regulate it now.Thus dream they, and contrive to save a GodThe incumbrance of his own concerns, and spareThe great Artificer of all that moves
The stress of a continual act, the painOf itted vigilance and care, laborious and severe a task. the moth, is not afraid it seems Omnipotence, and measure mightThat knows no measure, by the scanty ruleAnd standard of his own, that is to day,And is not, 'ere to-morrow's sun go down.But how should matter occupy a charge as it is, and satisfy a lawSo vast in its demands, unless impell'deaseless service by a ceaseless force,And under pressure of some conscious cause?The Lord of all, himself through all diffused,Sustains and is the life of all that lives.Nature is but a name for an effectWhose cause is God. He feeds the secret fireBy which the mighty process is maintain'd,Who sleeps not, is not weary; in whose sightSlow-circling ages are as transient days;
Whose work is without labor, whose designNo flaw deforms, no difficulty thwarts,And whose beneficence no charge exhaustsHim blind antiquity profaned, not serv'd,With self-taught rites and under various namesFemale and male, Pomona, Pales, Pan,And Flora and Vertumnus; peopling earthWith tutelary goddesses and godsThat were not, and commending as they wouldTo each some province, garden, field, or grove.But all are under one. One spirit—HisWho wore the platted thorns with bleeding brows,Rules universal nature. Not a flow'rBut shows some touch in freckle, streak or stain,Of his unrivall'd pencil. He inspiresTheir balmy odors and imparts their hues,And bathes their eyes with nectar, and includesIn grains as countless as the sea-side sands,The forms with which he sprinkles all the earth.Happy who walks with him! whom what he finds
Of flavour or of scent in fruit or flow'r,Or what he views of beautiful or grandIn Nature, from the broad majestic oakTo the green blade that twinkles in the fun,Prompts with remembrance of a present God.His presence who made all so fair, perceived,Makes all still fairer. As with him no sceneIs dreary, so with him all seasons please.Though winter had been none, had man been true,And earth be punished for its tenant's sake,Yet not in vengeance; as this smiling skySo soon succeeding such an angry night,And these dissolving snows, and this clear streamRecov'ring fast its liquid music, prove.Who then that has a mind well strung and tunedTo contemplation, and within his reachA scene so friendly to his fav'rite task,Would waste attention at the chequer'd board,His host of wooden warriors to and fro
Marching and counter-marching, with an eyeAs fixt as marble, with a forehead ridgedAnd furrow'd into storms, and with a handTrembling, as if eternity were hungIn balance on his conduct of a pin?Nor envies he aught more their idle sportWho pant with application misappliedTo trivial toys, and pushing iv'ry ballsAcross the velvet level, feel a joyAkin to rapture, when the bawble findsIts destin'd goal of difficult access.Nor deems he wiser him, who gives his noonTo Miss, the Mercer's plague, from shop to shopWand'ring, and litt'ring with unfolded silksThe polished counter, and approving none,Or promising with smiles to call again.Nor him, who by his vanity seducedAnd sooth'd into a dream that he discernsThe difference of a Guido from a daub,Frequents the crowded auction. Station'd there
As duely as the Langford of the show,With glass at eye, and catalogue in hand,And tongue accomplish'd in the fulsome cantAnd pedantry that coxcombs learn with ease,Oft as the price-deciding hammer fallsHe notes it in his book, then raps his boxSwears 'tis a bargain, rails at his hard fateThat he has let it pass—but never bids.Here unmolefted, through whatever signThe sun proceeds, I wander. Neither mist,Nor freezing sky, nor sultry, checking me,Nor stranger intermeddling with my joy.Ev'n in the spring and play-time of the yearThat calls the unwonted villager abroadWith all her little ones, a sportive train,To gather king-cups in the yellow mead,And prink their hair with daisies, or to pickA cheap but wholesome sallad from the brook,These shades are all my own. The tim'rous hare
Grown so familiar with her frequent guestScarce shuns me; and the stock dove unalarm'dSits cooing in the pine-tree, nor suspendsHis long love-ditty for my near approach.Drawn from his refuge in some lonely elmThat age or injury has hollow'd deep,Where on his bed of wool and matted leavesHe has outslept the winter, ventures forthTo frisk awhile, and bask in the warm sun,The squirrel, flippant, pert, and full of play.He sees me, and at once, swift as a birdAscends the neighb'ring beech; there whisks his brushAnd perks his ears, and stamps and scolds aloud,With all the prettiness of feign'd alarm,And anger insignificantly fierce.The heart is hard in nature, and unfitFor human fellowship, as being voidOf sympathy, and therefore dead alikeTo love and friendship both, that is not pleased
With sight of animals enjoying life,Nor feels their happiness augment his own.The bounding fawn that darts across the gladeWhen none pursues, through mere delight of heart,And spirits buoyant with excess of glee;The horse, as wanton and almost as fleet,That skims the spacious meadow at full speed,Then stops and snorts, and throwing high his heelsStarts to the voluntary race again;The very kine that gambol at high noon,The total herd receiving first from oneThat leads the dance, a summons to be gay,Though wild their strange vagaries, and uncouthTheir efforts, yet resolved with one consentTo give such act and utt'rance as they mayTo extasy too big to be suppress'd—These, and a thousand images of bliss,With which kind nature graces ev'ry sceneWhere cruel man defeats not her design,Impart to the benevolent, who wish
All that are capable of pleasure, pleased,A far superior happiness to theirs,The comfort of a reasonable joy.Man scarce had ris'n, obedient to his callWho form'd him, from the dust his future grave,When he was crown'd as never king was since.God set the diadem upon his head,And angel choirs attended. Wond'ring stoodThe new-made monarch, while before him pass'd,All happy and all perfect in their kindThe creatures, summon'd from their various hauntsTo see their sov'reign, and confess his sway.Vast was his empire, absolute his pow'r,Or bounded only by a law whose force'Twas his sublimest privilege to feelAnd own, the law of universal love.He ruled with meekness, they obeyed with joy.No cruel purpose lurk'd within his heart,And no distrust of his intent in theirs.
So Eden was a scene of harmless sport,Where kindness on his part who ruled the wholeBegat a tranquil confidence in all,And fear as yet was not, nor cause for fear.But sin marr'd all. And the revolt of man,That source of evils not exhausted yet,Was punish'd with revolt of his from him.Garden of God, how terrible the changeThy groves and lawns then witness'd! ev'ry heart,Each animal of ev'ry name, conceivedA jealousy and an instinctive fear,And conscious of some danger, either fledPrecipitate the loath'd abode of man,Or growl'd defiance in such angry sort,As taught him too to tremble in his turn.Thus harmony and family accordWere driv'n from Paradise; and in that hourThe seeds of cruelty that since have swell'dTo such gigantic and enormous growth,Were sown in human nature's fruitful soil.
Hence date the persecution and the painThat man inflicts on all inferior kindsRegardless of their plaints. To make him sport,To gratify the frenzy of his wrath,Or his base gluttony, are causes goodAnd just in his account, why bird and beastShould suffer torture, and the streams be dyedWith blood of their inhabitants impaled.Earth groans beneath the burthen of a warWaged with defenceless innocence, while he,Not satisfied to prey on all around,Adds tenfold bitterness to death, by pangsNeedless, and first torments 'ere he devours.Now happiest they that occupy the scenesThe most remote from his abhorr'd resort,Whom once as delegate of God on earthThey fear'd, and as his perfect image loved.The wilderness is theirs with all its caves,Its hollow glenns, its thickets, and its plainsUnvisited by man. There they are free,
And howl and roar as likes them, uncontroul'd,Nor ask his leave to slumber or to play.Woe to the tyrant if he dare intrudeWithin the confines of their wild domain;The lion tells him—I am monarch here—And if he spare him, spares him on the termsOf royal mercy, and through gen'rous scornTo rend a victim trembling at his foot.In measure as by force of instinct drawn,Or by necessity constrain'd, they liveDependent upon man, those in his fields,These at his crib, and some beneath his roof,They prove too often at how dear a rateHe sells protection. Witness, at his footThe spaniel dying for some venial fault,Under dissection of the knotted scourge.Witness, the patient ox, with stripes and yellsDriv'n to the slaughter, goaded as he runsTo madness, while the savage at his heelsLaughs at the frantic suff'rers fury spent
Upon the guiltless passenger o'erthrown.He too is witness, noblest of the trainThat wait on man, the flight-performing horse.With unsuspecting readiness he takesHis murth'rer on his back, and push'd all dayWith bleeding sides and flanks that heave for lifeTo the far-distant goal, arrives and dies.So little mercy shows who needs so much!Does law, so jealous in the cause of man,Denounce no doom on the delinquent? None.He lives, and o'er his brimming beaker boasts(As if barbarity were high desert)Th' inglorious feat, and clamorous in praiseOf the poor brute, seems wisely to supposeThe honors of his matchless horse his own.But many a crime, deem'd innocent on earth,Is register'd in heav'n, and these no doubt,Have each their record, with a curse annext.Man may dismiss compassion from his heart,But God will never. When he charged the Jew
T' assist his foe's down-fallen beast to rise,And when the bush-exploring boy that seizedThe young, to let the parent bird go free,Proved he not plainly that his meaner worksAre yet his care, and have an interest all,All, in the universal father's love.On Noah, and in him on all mankindThe charter was conferr'd by which we holdThe flesh of animals in fee, and claimO'er all we feed on, pow'r of life and death.But read the instrument, and mark it well.Th' oppression of a tyrannous controulCan find no warrant there. Feed then, and yieldThanks for thy food. Carnivorous through sinFeed on the slain, but spare the living brute.The Governor of all, himself to allSo bountiful, in whose attentive earThe unfledged raven and the lion's whelpPlead not in vain for pity on the pangs
Of hunger unassuaged, has interposed,Not seldom, his avenging arm, to smiteTh' injurious trampler upon nature's lawThat claims forbearance even for a brute.He hates the hardness of a Balaam's heart;And prophet as he was, he might not strikeThe blameless animal, without rebuke,On which he rode. Her opportune offenceSaved him, or th' unrelenting seer had died.He sees that human equity is slackTo interfere, though in so just a cause,And makes the task his own. Inspiring dumbAnd helpless victims with a sense so keenOf injury, with such knowledge of their strength,And such sagacity to take revenge,That oft the beast has seemed to judge the man.An ancient, not a legendary tale,By one of sound intelligence rehears'd(If such, who plead for Providence, may seemIn modern eyes) shall make the doctrine clear.Where England stretch'd towards the setting sunNarrow and long, o'erlooks the western wave,Dwelt young Misagathus. A scorner heOf God and goodness, atheist in ostent,Vicious in act, in temper savage-fierce.He journey'd, and his chance was as he went,To join a trav'ller of far diff'rent noteEvander, famed for piety, for yearsDeserving honor, but for wisdom more.Fame had not left the venerable manA stranger to the manners of the youth,Whose face too was familiar to his view.Their way was on the margin of the land,O'er the green summit of the rocks whose baseBeats back the roaring surge, scarce heard so high.The charity that warm'd his heart was movedAt sight of the man-monster. With a smileGentle, and affable, and full of grace,As fearful of offending whom he wish'dMuch to persuade, he plied his ear with truths
Not harshly thunder'd forth or rudely press'd,But like his purpose, gracious, kind, and sweet.And dost thou dream, th' impenetrable manExclaim'd, that me, the lullabies of ageAnd fantasies of dotards such as thouCan cheat, or move a moment's fear in me?Mark now the proof I give thee, that the braveNeed no such aids as superstition lendsTo steel their hearts against the dread of death.He spoke, and to the precipice at handPush'd with a madman's fury. Fancy shrinks,And the blood thrills and curdles at the thoughtOf such a gulph as he design'd his grave.But though the felon on his back could dareThe dreadful leap, more rational his steedDeclined the death, and wheeling swiftly roundOr 'ere his hoof had press'd the crumbling verge,Baffled his rider, saved against his will.The frenzy of the brain may be redress'dBy med'cine well applied, but without grace
The heart's insanity admits no cure.Enraged the more by what might have reform'dHis horrible intent, again he soughtDestruction with a zeal to be destroyed,With sounding whip and rowels dyed in blood.But still in vain. The providence that meantA longer date to the far nobler beast,Spared yet again th' ignobler for his sake.And now, his prowess proved, and his sincereIncurable obduracy evinced,His rage grew cool; and pleased perhaps t' have earn'dSo cheaply the renown of that attempt,With looks of some complacence he resumedHis road, deriding much the blank amazeOf good Evander, still where he was leftFixt motionless, and petrified with dread.So on they fared; discourse on other themesEnsuing, seem'd to obliterate the past,And tamer far for so much fury shown,(As is the course of rash and fiery men)
The rude companion smiled as if transform'd.But 'twas a transient calm. A storm was near,An unsuspected storm. His hour was come.The impious challenger of pow'r divineWas now to learn, that heav'n though slow to wrath,Is never with impunity defied.His horse, as he had caught his master's mood,Snorting, and starting into sudden rage,Unbidden, and not now to be controul'd,Rush'd to the cliff, and having reach'd it, stood.At once the shock unseated him. He flewSheer o'er the craggy barrier, and immersedDeep in the flood, found, when he sought it not,The death he had deserved, and died alone.So God wrought double justice; made the foolThe victim of his own tremendous choiceAnd taught a brute the way to safe revenge.I would not enter on my list of friends(Though grac'd with polish'd manners and fine sense
Yet wanting sensibility) the manWho needlessly sets foot upon a worm.An inadvertent step may crush the snailThat crawls at evening in the public path,But he that has humanity, forewarned,Will tread aside, and let the reptile live.The creeping vermin, loathsome to the sight,And charged perhaps with venom, that intrudesA visitor unwelcome into scenesSacred to neatness and repose, th' alcove,The chamber, or refectory, may die.A necessary act incurs no blame.Not so when held within their proper boundsAnd guiltless of offence, they range the air,Or take their pastime in the spacious field.There they are privileged. And he that huntsOr harms them there, is guilty of a wrong,Disturbs th' oeconomy of nature's realm,Who when she form'd, designed them an abode.The sum is this: if man's convenience, health,
Or safety interfere, his rights and claimsAre paramount, and must extinguish theirs.Else they are all—the meanest things that are,As free to live and to enjoy that life,As God was free to form them at the first,Who in his sov'reign wisdom made them all.Ye therefore who love mercy, teach your sonsTo love it too. The spring-time of our yearsIs soon dishonour'd and defiled in mostBy budding ills, that ask a prudent handTo check them. But alas! none sooner shoots,If unrestrain'd, into luxuriant growth,Than cruelty, most dev'lish of them all.Mercy to him that shows it, is the ruleAnd righteous limitation of its actBy which heav'n moves in pard'ning guilty man;And he that shows none, being ripe in years,And conscious of the out'rage he commitsShall seek it, and not find it in his turn.Distinguish'd much by reason, and still moreBy our capacity of grace divine,From creatures that exist but for our sake,Which having served us, perish, we are heldAccountable, and God, some future day,Will reckon with us roundly for th' abuseOf what he deems no mean or trivial trust.Superior as we are, they yet dependNot more on human help, than we on theirs.Their strength, or speed, or vigilance, were givIn aid of our defects. In some are foundSuch teachable and apprehensive parts,That man's attainments in his own concernsMatch'd with th' expertness of the brutes in theirs,Are oft-times vanquish'd and thrown far behind.Some show that nice sagacity of smell,And read with such discernment, in the portsAnd figure of the man, his secret aim,That oft we owe our safety to a skillWe could not teach, and must despair to learn.
But learn we might, if not too proud to stoopTo quadrupede instructors, many a goodAnd useful quality, and virtue too,Rarely exemplified among ourselves.Attachment never to be wean'd, or changedBy any change of fortune, proof alikeAgainst unkindness, absence, and neglect;Fidelity, that neither bribe nor threatCan move or warp, and gratitude for smallAnd trivial favors, lasting as the life,And glist'ning even in the dying eye.Man praises man. Desert in arts or armsWins public honor; and ten thousand sitPatiently present at a sacred song,Commemoration-mad; content to hear(Oh wonderful effect of music's pow'r!)Mussiah's eulogy, for Handel's sake.But less, methinks, than sacrilege might serve—(For was it less? What heathen would have dared
To strip Jove's statue of his oaken wreathAnd hang it up in honor of a man!)Much less might serve, when all that we designIs but to gratify an itching ear,And give the day to a musician's praise.Remember Handel? who that was not bornDeaf as the dead to harmony, forgets,Or can, the more than Homer of his age?Yes—we remember him. And while we praiseA talent so divine, remember tooThat His most holy book from whom it cameWas never meant, was never used beforeTo buckram out the mem'ry of a man.But hush!—the muse perhaps is too severe,And with a gravity beyond the sizeAnd measure of th' offence, rebukes a deedLess impious than absurd, and owing moreTo want of judgment than to wrong design.So in the chapel of old Ely House,When wand'ring Charles, who meant to be the third,
Had fled from William, and the news was fresh,The simple clerk but loyal, did announce,And eke did rear right merrily, two staves,Sung to the praise and glory of King George.—Man praises man, and Garrick's mem'ry next,When time hath somewhat mellow'd it, and madeThe idol of our worship while he lived,The God of our idolatry once more,Shall have its altar; and the world shall goIn pilgrimage to bow before his shrine.The theatre too small, shall suffocateIts squeezed contents, and more than it admitsShall sigh at their exclusion, and returnUngratified. For there some noble lordShall stuff his shoulders with king Richard's bunch,Or wrap himself in Hamlet's inky cloak,And strut, and storm and straddle, stamp and stare,The show the world how Garrick did not act.For Garrick was a worshipper himself;He drew the Liturgy, and framed the rites
And solemn ceremonial of the day,And call'd the world to worship on the banksOf Avon famed in song. Ah pleasant proof!That piety has still in human heartsSome place, a spark or two not yet extinct.The mulb'ry tree was hung with blooming wreaths,The mulb'ry tree stood center of the dance,The mulb'ry tree was hymn'd with dulcet airs,And from his touchwood trunk, the mulb'ry treeSupplied such relics, as devotion holdsStill sacred, and preserves with pious care.So 'twas an hallow'd time. Decorum reign'd,And mirth without offence. No few return'dDoubtless much edified, and all refreshed.—Man praises man. The rabble all alive,From tipling-benches, cellars, stalls, and styes,Swarm in the streets. The statesman of the day,A pompous and slow-moving pageant comes.Some shout him, and some hang upon his carTo gaze in's eyes and bless him. Maidens wave
Their 'kerchiefs, and old women weep for joy.While others not so satisfied unhorseThe gilded equipage, and turning looseHis streeds, usurp a place they well deserve.Why? what has charm'd them? Hath he saved the stateNo. Doth he purpose its salvation? No.Inchanting novelty, that moon at full,That finds out ev'ry crevice of the headThat is not sound and perfect, hath in theirsWrought this disturbance. But the wane is near,And his own cattle must suffice him soon.Thus idly do we waste the breath of praise,And dedicate a tribute, in its useAnd just direction, sacred, to a thingDoomed to the dust, or lodged already there.Encomium in old time was poet's work.But poets having lavishly long sinceExhausted all materials of the art,The task now falls into the public hand.And I, contented with an humble theme,
Have poured my stream of panegyric downThe vale of nature, where it creeps and windsAmong her lovely works, with a secureAnd unambitious course, reflecting clearIf not the virtues yet the worth of brutes,And I am recompensed, and deem the toilsOf poetry not lost, if verse of mineMay stand between an animal and woe,And teach one tyrant pity for his drudge.The groans of nature in this nether worldWhich heav'n has heard for ages, have an end.Foretold by prophets, and by poets sungWhose fire was kindled at the prophets lamp,The time of rest, the promised sabbath comes.Six thousand years of sorrow have well-nighFulfilled their tardy and disastrous courseOver a sinful world. And what remainsOf this tempestuous state of human things,Is merely as the working of a sea
Before a calm, that rocks itself to rest.For he whose car the winds are, and the cloudsThe dust that waits upon his sultry marchWhen sin hath moved him, and his wrath is hot,Shall visit earth in mercy; shall descendPropitious, in his chariot paved with love,And what his storms have blasted and defacedFor man's revolt, shall with a smile repair.Sweet is the harp of prophesy. Too sweetNot to be wrong'd by a mere mortal touch;Nor can the wonders it records, be sungTo meaner music, and not suffer loss.But when a poet, or when one like me,Happy to rove among poetic flow'rsThough poor in skill to rear them, lights at lastOn some sair theme, some theme divinely fair,Such is the impulse and the spur he feelsTo give it praise proportioned to its worth,
That not t' attempt it, arduous as he deemsThe labor, were a task more arduous still.Oh scenes surpassing fable, and yet true,Scenes of accomplish'd bliss! which who can seeThough but in distant prospect, and not feelHis soul refresh'd with foretaste of the joy?Rivers of gladness water all the earth,And clothe all climes with beauty; the reproachOf barreness is past. The fruitful fieldLaughs with abundance, and the land once lean,Or fertile only in its own disgrace,Exults to see its thistly curse repealed.The various seasons woven into one,And that one season an eternal spring,The garden fears no blight, and needs no fenceFor there is none to covet, all are full.The lion and the libbard and the bearGraze with the fearless siocks. All bask at noonTogether, or all gambol in the shade
Of the same grove, and drink one common stream.Antipathies are none. No foe to manLurks in the serpent now. The mother seesAnd smiles to see her infant's playful handStretch'd forth to dally with the crested worm,To stroak his azure neck, or to receiveThe lambent homage of his arrowy tongue.All creatures worship man, and all mankindOne Lord, one Father. Error has no place;That creeping pestilence is driv'n away,The breath of heav'n has chased it. In the heartNo passion touches a discordant string,But all is harmony and love. DiseaseIs not. The pure and uncontaminate bloodHolds its due course, nor fears the frost of age.One song employs all nations, and all cry"Worthy the Lamb, for he was slain for us"The dwellers in the vales and on the rocksShout to each other, and the mountain topsFrom distant mountains catch the flying joy,
'Till nation after nation taught the strain,Earth rolls the rapturous Hosanna round.Behold the measure of the promise filled,See Salem built, the labour of a God!Bright as a sun the sacred city shines;All kingdoms and all princes of the earthFlock to that light; the glory of all landsFlows into her, unbounded is her joyAnd endless her encrease. Thy rams are thereNebaioth and Kedar the sons of Ishamael and progenitors of the Arabs, in the prophetic scripture here alluded to, may be reasonably considered as representatives of the Gentiles at large. Nebaioth, and the flocks of Kedar there;The looms of Ormus, and the mines of Ind,And Saba's spicey groves pay tribute there.Praise is in all her gates. Upon her walls,And in her streets, and in her spacious courtsIs heard salvation. Eastern Java thereKneels with the native of the farthest West,
And Aethiopia spreads abroad the handAnd worships. Her report has travell'd forthInto all lands. From every clime they comeTo see thy beauty and to share thy joyO Sion! an assembly such as earthSaw never, such as heav'n stoops down to see.Thus heav'n-ward all things tend. For all were oncePerfect, and all must be at length restored.So God has greatly purposed; who would elseIn his dishonoured works himself endureDishonor, and be wrong'd without redress.Haste then, and wheel away a shatter'd worldYe slow-revolving seasons! we would see,(A sight to which our eyes are strangers yet)A world that does not dread and hate his laws,And suffer for its crime. Would learn how fairThe creature is that God pronounces good,How pleasant in itself what pleases him.Here ev'ry drop of honey hides a sting,Worms wind themselves into our sweetest flow'rs,
And ev'n the joy that haply some poor heartDerives from heav'n, pure as the fountain isIs sullied in the stream; taking a taintFrom touch of human lips, at best impure.Oh for a world in principle as chasteAs this is gross and selfish! over whichCustom and prejudice shall bear no swayThat govern all things here, should'ring asideThe meek and modest truth, and forcing herTo seek a refuge from the tongue of strifeIn nooks obscure, far from the ways of men.Where violence shall never lift the sword,Nor cunning justify the proud man's wrong,Leaving the poor no remedy but tears.Where he that fills an office, shall esteemTh' occasion it presents of doing goodMore than the perquisite. Where law shall speakSeldom, and never but as wisdom promptsAnd equity; not jealous more to guardA worthless form, than to decide aright.
Where fashion shall not sanctify abuse,Nor smooth good-breeding (supplemental grace)With lean performance ape the work of love.Come then, and added to thy many crownsReceive yet one, the crown of all the earth,Thou who alone art worthy! it was thineBy antient covenant 'ere nature's birth,And thou hast made it thine by purchase since,And overpaid its value with thy blood.Thy saints proclaim thee king; and in their heartsThy title is engraven with a penDipt in the fountain of eternal love.Thy saints proclaim thee king; and thy delayGives courage to their foes, who, could they seeThe dawn of thy last advent long-desired,Would creep into the bowels of the hills,And flee for safety to the falling rocks.The very spirit of the world is tiredOf its own taunting question ask'd so long,
"Where is the promise of your Lord's approach?"The infidel has shot his bolts away,'Till his exhausted quiver yielding none,He gleans the blunted shafts that have recoiled,And aims them at the shield of truth again.The veil is rent, rent too by priestly hands,That hides divinity from mortal eyes,And all the mysteries to faith proposedInsulted and traduced, are cast asideAs useless, to the moles and to the bats.They now are deem'd the faithful and are praised,Who constant only in rejecting thee,Deny thy Godhead with a martyr's zeal,And quit their office for their errors sake.Blind and in love with darkness! yet ev'n theseWorthy, compared with sycophants, who kneeThy name, adoring, and then preach thee man.So fares thy church. But how thy church may fareThe world takes little thought; who will may preach,And what they will. All pastors are alike
To wand'ring sheep, resolved to follow none.Two gods divide them all, pleasure and gain.For these they live, they sacrifice to these,And in their service wage perpetual warWith conscience and with thee. Lust in their hearts,And mischief in their hands, they roam the earthTo prey upon each other; stubborn, fierce,High-minded, foaming out their own disgrace.Thy prophets speak of such; and noting downThe features of the last degen'rate times,Exhibit ev'ry lineament of these.Come then, and added to thy many crownsReceive yet one, as radiant as the rest,Due to thy last and most effectual work,Thy word fulfilled, the conquest of a world.He is the happy man, whose life ev'n nowShows somewhat of that happier life to come.Who doomed to an obscure but tranquil stateIs pleased with it, and were he free to chuse,
Would make his fate his choice. Whom peace, the fruitOf virtue, and whom virtue, fruit of faith,Prepare for happiness; bespeak him oneContent indeed to sojourn while he mustBelow the skies, but having there his home.The world o'erlooks him in her busy searchOf objects more illustrious in her view;And occupied as earnestly as sheThough more sublimely, he o'erlooks the world.She scorns his pleasures, for she knows them not;He seeks not hers, for he has proved them vain.He cannot skim the ground like summer birdsPursuing gilded flies, and such he deemsHer honors, her emoluments, her joys.Therefore in contemplation is his bliss,Whose pow'r is such, that whom she lifts from earthShe makes familiar with a heav'n unseen,And shows him glories yet to be revealed.Not slothful he, though seeming unemployed,And censured oft as useless. Stillest streams
Oft water fairest meadows, and the birdThat flutters least, is longest on the wing.Ask him indeed, what trophies he has raised,Or what atchievements of immortal fameHe purposes, and he shall answer—none.His warfare is within. There unfatiguedHis fervent spirit labors. There he fights,And there obtains fresh triumphs o'er himself,And never-with'ring wreaths, compared with whichThe laurels that a Caesar reaps are weeds.Perhaps the self-approving haughty worldThat as she sweeps him with her whistling silksScarce deigns to notice him, or if she seeDeems him a cypher in the works of God,Receives advantage from his noiseless hoursOf which she little dreams. Perhaps she owesHer sunshine and her rain, her blooming springAnd plenteous harvest, to the pray'r he makes,When Isaac like, the solitary saintWalks forth to meditate at even-tide,
And think on her, who thinks not for herself.Forgive him then, thou bustler in concernsOf little worth, and idler in the best,If author of no mischief and some good,He seek his proper happiness by meansThat may advance, but cannot hinder thine.Nor though he tread the secret path of life,Engage no notice, and enjoy much ease,Account him an incumbrance on the state,Receiving benefits, and rend'ring none.His sphere though humble, if that humble sphereShine with his fair example, and though smallHis influence, if that influence all be spentIn soothing sorrow and in quenching strife,In aiding helpless indigence, in worksFrom which at least a grateful few deriveSome taste of comfort in a world of woe,Then let the supercilious great confessHe serves his country; recompenses wellThe state beneath the shadow of whose vine
He sits secure, and in the scale of lifeHolds no ignoble, though a slighted place.The man whose virtues are more felt than seen,Must drop indeed the hope of public praise,But he may boast what few that win it can,That if his country stand not by his skill,At least his follies have not wrought her fall.Polite refinement offers him in vainHer golden tube, through which a sensual worldDraws gross impurity, and likes it well,The neat conveyance hiding all th' offence.Not that he peevishly rejects a modeBecause that world adopts it. If it bearThe stamp and clear impression of good sense,And be not costly more than of true worth,He puts it on, and for decorum sakeCan wear it e'en as gracefully as she.She judges of refinement by the eye,He by the test of conscience, and a heartNot soon deceived; aware that what is base
No polish can make sterling, and that viceThough well perfumed and elegantly dress'd,Like an unburied carcase trick'd with flow'rsIs but a garnish'd nuisance, fitter farFor cleanly riddance than for fair attire.So life glides smoothly and by stealth away,More golden than that age of fabled goldRenown'd in ancient song; not vex'd with careOr stained with guilt, beneficent, approvedOf God and man, and peaceful in its end.So glide my life away! and so at lastMy share of duties decently fulfilled,May some disease, not tardy to performIts destin'd office, yet with gentle stroke,Dismiss me weary to a safe retreatBeneath the turf that I have often trod.It shall not grieve me, then, that once when calledTo dress a Sofa with the flow'rs of verse,I play'd awhile, obedient to the fairWith that light task, but soon to please her more
Whom flow'rs alone I knew would little please,Let fall th' unfinish'd wreath, and roved for fruit.Roved far and gather'd much. Some harsh, 'tis true,Pick'd from the thorns and briars of reproof,But wholesome, well-digested. Grateful someTo palates that can taste immortal truth,Insipid else, and sure to be despised.But all is in his hand whose praise I seek.In vain the poet sings, and the world hears,If he regard not, though divine the theme.'Tis not in artful measures, in the chimeAnd idle tinkling of a minstrel's lyreTo charm his ear, whose eye is on the heart.Whose frown can disappoint the proudest strain,Whose approbation—prosper even mine.AN
EPISTLE
TO
JOSEPH HILL, ESQ.DEAR JOSEPH—five and twenty years ago—Alas! how time escapes—'tis even so—With frequent intercourse and always sweetAnd always friendly, we were won't to cheatA tedious hour—and now we never meet.As some grave gentleman in Terence says,('Twas therefore much the same in ancient days)Good lack, we know not what to-morrow brings—Strange fluctuation of all human things!True. Changes will befall, and friends may part,But distance only cannot change the heart:
And were I call'd to prove th' assertion true,One proof should serve, a reference to you.Whence comes it then, that in the wane of life,Though nothing have occurr'd to kindle strife,We find the friends we fancied we had won,Though num'rous once, reduced to few or none?Can gold grow worthless that has stood the touch?No: Gold they seemed, but they were never suchHoratio's servant once, with bow and cringeSwinging the parlour door upon its hinge,Dreading a negative, and overawedLest he should trespass, begg'd to go abroad.Go fellow!—whither?—turning short about—Nay. Stay at home;—you're always going out.'Tis but a step, sir, just at the street's end—For what?—An please you sir, to see a friend.A friend? Horatio cried, and seem'd to start—Yea marry shalt thou, and with all my heart—
And fetch my cloak, for though the night be rawI'll see him too—the first I ever saw.I knew the man, and knew his nature mild,And was his play-thing often when a child,But somewhat at that moment pinch'd him close,Else he was seldom bitter or morose.Perhaps his confidence just then betray'd,His grief might prompt him with the speech he made,Perhaps 'twas mere good-humour gave it birth,The harmless play of pleasantry and mirth.Howe'er it was, his language in my mindBespoke at least a man that knew mankind:But not to moralize too much, and strainTo prove an evil of which all complain,(I hate long arguments, verbosely spun)One story more, dear Hill, and I have done:Once on a time, an Emp'ror, a wise man,No matter where, in China or Japan,Decreed that whosoever should offendAgainst the well known duties of a friend,
Convicted once, should ever after wearBut half a coat, and show his bosom bare.The punishment importing this, no doubt,That all was naught within, and all found out.Oh happy Britain! we have not to fearSuch hard and arbitrary measure here.Else could a law like that which I relate,Once have the sanction of our triple state,Some few that I have known in days of oldWould run most dreadful risk of catching cold.While you, my friend, whatever wind should blow,Might traverse England safely to and fro,An honest man, close-buttoned to the chin,Broad-cloth without, and a warm heart within.TIROCINIUM:

REVIEW OF SCHOOLS.PLATO.DIOG. LAERT.TO THE
REV. WILLIAM CAWTHORNE UNWIN,
RECTOR OF STOCK IN ESSEX,
THE TUTOUR OF HIS TWO SONS,
THE FOLLOWING
POEM,
RECOMMENDING PRIVATE TUITION
IN PREFERENCE TO
AN EDUCATION AT SCHOOL,
IS INSCRIBED,
BY HIS AFFECTIONATE FRIEND,WILLIAM COWPER.Olney,Nov. 6, 1784.TIROCINIUM.IT is not from his form in which we traceStrength joined with beauty, dignity with grace,That man, the master of this globe, derivesHis right of empire over all that lives.That form indeed, th' associate of a mindVast in its pow'rs, ethereal in its kind,That form, the labour of almighty skill,Framed for the service of a free-born will,Asserts precedence, and bespeaks controul,But borrows all its grandeur from the soul.Hers is the state, the splendour and the throne,An intellectual kingdom, all her own.
For her, the mem'ry fills her ample pageWith truths pour'd down from ev'ry distant age,For her amasses an unbounded store,The wisdom of great nations, now no more,Though laden, not incumber'd with her spoil,Laborious, yet unconscious of her toil,When copiously supplied, then most enlarged,Still to be fed, and not to be surcharged.For her, the fancy roving unconfined,The present muse of ev'ry pensive mind,Works magic wonders, adds a brighter hueTo nature's scenes, than nature ever knew,At her command, winds rise and waters roar,Again she lays them slumb'ring on the shore,With flow'r and fruit the wilderness supplies,Or bids the rocks in ruder pomp arise.For her, the judgment, umpire in the strife,That grace and nature have to wage through life,Quick-sighted arbiter of good and ill,Appointed sage preceptor to the will,
Condemns, approves, and with a faithful voiceGuides the decision of a doubtful choice.Why did the fiat of a God give birthTo yon fair sun and his attendant earth,And when descending he resigns the skies,Why takes the gent'ler moon her turn to rise,Whom ocean feels through all his countless waves,And owns her pow'r on ev'ry shore he laves?Why do the seasons still enrich the year,Fruitful and young as in their first career?Spring hangs her infant blossoms on the trees,Rock'd in the cradle of the western breeze,Summer in haste the thriving charge receivesBeneath the shade of her expanded leaves,'Till autumn's fiercer heats and plenteous dewsDye them at last in all their glowing hues—'Twere wild profusion all, and bootless waste,Pow'r misemployed, munificence misplaced,
Had not its author dignified the plan,And crowned it with the majesty of man.Thus form'd, thus placed, intelligent, and taughtLook where he will, the wonders God has wroughtThe wildest scorner of his Maker's lawsFinds in a sober moment time to pause,To press th' important question on his heart,"Why form'd at all, and wherefore as thou art?"If man be what he seems, this hour a slave,The next mere dust and ashes in the grave,Endued with reason only to descryHis crimes and follies with an aching eye,With passions, just that he may prove with painThe force he spends against their fury, vain,And if soon after having burnt by turnsWith ev'ry lust with which frail nature burns,His being end where death dissolves the bond,The tomb take all, and all be blank beyond,Then he, of all that nature has brought forthStands self-impeach'd the creature of least worth,
And useless while he lives, and when he dies,Brlngs into doubt the wisdom of the skies.Truths that the learn'd pursue with eager thought,Are not important always as dear-bought,Proving at last, though told in pompous strains,A childish waste of philosophic pains;But truths on which depends our main concern,That 'tis our shame and mis'ry not to learn,Shine by the side of ev'ry path we treadWith such a lustre, he that runs may read.'Tis true, that if to trifle life awayDown to the sun-set of their latest day,Then perish on futurity's wide shoreLike fleeting exhalations, found no more,Were all that heav'n required of human kind,And all the plan their destiny designed,What none could rev'rence all might justly blame,And man would breathe but for his Maker's shame.
But reason heard, and nature well perused,At once the dreaming mind is disabused.If all we find possessing earth, sea, air,Reflect his attributes who plac'd them there,Fulfill the purpose, and appear design'dProofs of the wisdom of th' all-seeing mind,'Tis plain, the creature whom he chose t' investWith kingship and dominion o'er the rest,Received his nobler nature, and was madeFit for the power in which he stands array'd,That first or last, hereafter if not here,He too might make his author's wisdom clear,Praise him on earth, or obstinately dumbSuffer his justice in a world to come.This once believed, 'twere logic misappliedTo prove a consequence by none denied,That we are bound to cast the minds of youthBetimes into the mould of heav'nly truth,That taught of God they may indeed be wise,Nor ignorantly wand'ring miss the skies.In early days the conscience has in mostA quickness, which in later life is lost,Preserved from guilt by salutary fears,Or, guilty, soon relenting into tears.Too careless often as our years proceed,What friends we sort with, or what books we read,Our parents yet exert a prudent careTo feed our infant minds with proper fare,And wisely store the nurs'ry by degreesWith wholesome learning, yet acquired with ease.Neatly secured from being soiled or tornBeneath a pane of thin translucent horn,A book (to please us at a tender age'Tis call'd a book, though but a single page)Presents the pray'r the Saviour deign'd to teach,Which children use, and parsons—when they preach.Lisping our syllables, we scramble next,Through moral narrative, or sacred text,And learn with wonder how this world began,Who made, who marr'd, and who has ransom'd man.
Points, which unless the Scripture made them plain,The wisest heads might agitate in vain.Oh thou, whom borne on fancy's eager wingBack to the season of life's happy spring,I pleased remember, and while mem'ry yetHolds fast her office here, can ne'er forget,Ingenious dreamer, in whose well told-taleSweet fiction and sweet truth alike prevail,Whose hum'rous vein, strong sense, and simple stile,May teach the gayest, make the gravest smile,Witty, and well-employ'd, and like thy Lord,Speaking in parables his slighted word,I name thee not, lest so despised a nameShould move a sneer at thy deserved fame,Yet ev'n in transitory life's late dayThat mingles all my brown with sober gray,Revere the man, whose Pilgrim marks the roadAnd guides the Progress of the soul to God.'Twere well with most, if books that could engageTheir childhood, pleased them at a riper age;
The man approving what had charm'd the boy,Would die at last in comfort, peace, and joy,And not with curses on his art who stoleThe gem of truth from his unguarded soul.The stamp of artless piety impress'dBy kind tuition on his yielding breast,The youth now bearded, and yet pert and raw,Regards with scorn, though once received with awe,And warp'd into the labyrinth of liesThat babblers, called philosophers, devise,Blasphemes his creed as founded on a planReplete with dreams, unworthy of a man.Touch but his nature in its ailing part,Assert the native evil of his heart,His pride resents the charge, although the proof See Chron. Ch. 26. v. 19.Rise in his forehead, and seem rank enough;Point to the cure, describe a Saviour's crossAs God's expedient to retrieve his loss,
The young apostate sickens at the view,And hates it with the malice of a Jew.How weak the barrier of mere nature provesOppos'd against the pleasures nature loves!While self-betray'd, and wilfully undone,She longs to yield, no sooner wooed than won.Try now the merits of this blest exchangeOf modest truth for wits eccentric range.'Time was, he closed as he began the dayWith decent duty, not ashamed to pray.The practice was a bond upon his heart,A pledge he gave for a consistent part,Nor could he dare prefumptuously displeaseA pow'r confess'd so lately on his knees.But now, farewell all legendary tales,The shadows fly, philosophy prevails,Pray'r to the winds and caution to the waves,Religion makes the free by nature slaves,
Priests have invented, and the world admiredWhat knavish priests promulgate as inspired,'Till reason, now no longer overawed,Resumes her pow'rs, and spurns the clumsy fraud,And common-sense diffusing real day,The meteor of the gospel dies away.Such rhapsodies our shrew'd discerning youthLearn from expert enquirers after truth,Whose only care, might truth presume to speak,Is not to find what they prosess to seek.And thus well-tutor'd only while we shareA mother's lectures and a nurse's care,And taught at schools much mythologic stuff, The author begs leave to explain, sensible that without such knowledge, neither the ancient poets nor historians can be tasted or indeed understood, he does not mean to censure the pains that are taken to instruct a school-boy in the religion of the heathen, but merely that neglect of christian culture which leaves him shamefully ignorant of his own.But sound religion sparingly enough,
Our early notices of truth disgracedSoon lose their credit, and are all effaced.Would you your son should be a sot or dunce,Lascivious, headstrong, or all these at once,That in good time, the stripling's finish'd tasteFor loose expence and fashionable waste,Should prove your ruin, and his own at last,Train him in public with a mob of boys,Childish in mischief only and in noise,Else of a mannish growth, and five in tenIn infidelity and lewdness, men.There shall he learn 'ere sixteen winter's old,That authors are most useful, pawn'd or sold,That pedantry is all that schools impart,But taverns teach the knowledge of the heart,There waiter Dick with Bacchanalian laysShall win his heart and have his drunken praise,His counsellor and bosom-friend shall prove,And some street-pacing harlot his first love.
Schools, unless discipline where doubly strong,Detain their adolescent charge too long.The management of Tiro's of eighteenIs difficult, their punishment obscene.The stout tall Captain, whose superior sizeThe minor heroes view with envious eyes,Becomes their pattern, upon whom they fixTheir whole attention, and ape all his tricks.His pride that scorns t' obey or to submit,With them is courage, his effront'ry wit.His wild excursions, window-breaking feats,Robb'ry of gardens, quarrels in the streets,His hair-breadth 'scapes, and all his daring schemes,Transport them, and are made their fav'rite themes.In little bosoms such atchievements strikeA kindred spark, they burn to do the like.Thus half accomplish'd, 'ere he yet beginTo show the peeping down upon his chin,And as maturity of years comes onMade just th' adept that you design'd your son,
T' insure the perseverance of his course,And give your monstrous project all its force,Send him to college. If he there be tamed,Or in one article of vice reclaimed,Where no regard of ord'nances is shownOr look'd for now, the fault must be his own.Some sneaking virtue lurks in him no doubt,Where neither strumpets charms nor drinking-bout,Nor gambling practices can find it out.Such youths of spirit, and that spirit tooYe nurs'ries of our boys, we owe to you.Though from ourselves the mischief more proceeds,For public schools 'tis public folly feeds.The slaves of custom and establish'd mode,With pack-horse constancy we keep the roadCrooked or strait, through quags or thorny dells,True to the jingling of our leaders bells.To follow foolish precedents, and winkWith both our eyes, is easier than to think,
And such an age as ours baulks no expenceExcept of caution and of common-sense,Else sure, notorious fact and proof so plainWould turn our steps into a wiser train.I blame not those who with what care they canO'erwatch the num'rous and unruly clan,Or if I blame, 'tis only that they darePromise a work of which they must despair.Have ye, ye sage intendants of the whole,An ubiquarian presence and controul,Elisha's eye, that when Gehazi stray'dWent with him, and saw all the game he play'd?Yes—ye are conscious; and on all the shelvesYour pupils strike upon, have struck yourselves.Or if by nature sober, ye had thenBoys as ye were, the gravity of men,Ye knew at least, by constant proofs address'dTo ears and eyes, the vices of the rest.But ye connive at what ye cannot cure,And evils not to be endured, endure,
Lest pow'r exerted, but without success,Should make the little ye retain still less.Ye once were justly famed for bringing forthUndoubted scholarship and genuine worth,And in the firmament of fame still shinesA glory bright as that of all the signsOf poets raised by you, and statesmen and divines.Peace to them all, those brilliant times are fled,And no such lights are kindling in their stead.Our striplings shine indeed, but with such raysAs set the midnight riot in a blaze,And seem, if judged by their expressive looks,Deeper in none than in their surgeons books.Say muse (for education made the song,No muse can hesitate or linger long)What causes move us, knowing as we mustThat these Menageries all fail their trust,To send our sons to scout and scamper there,While colts and puppies cost us so much care?Be it a weakness, it deserves some praise,We love the play-place of our early days.The scene is touching, and the heart is stoneThat feels not at that sight, and feels at none.The wall on which we tried our graving skill,The very name we carved subsisting still,The bench on which we sat while deep-employ'dThough mangled, hack'd and hew'd, not yet destroy'd,The little ones unbutton'd, glowing hot,Playing our games, and on the very spot,As happy as we once, to kneel and drawThe chalky ring, and knuckle down at taw,To pitch the ball into the grounded hat,Or drive it devious with a dex'trous pat,The pleasing spectacle at once excitesSuch recollection of our own delights,That viewing it, we seem almost t' obtainOur innocent sweet simple years again.This fond attachment to the well-known placeWhence first we started into life's long race,
Maintains its hold with such unfailing sway,We feel it ev'n in age, and at our latest day.Hark! how the sire of chits whose future shareOf classic food begins to be his care,With his own likeness placed on either knee,Indulges all a father's heart-felt glee,And tells them as he strokes their silver locks,That they must soon learn Latin and to box;Then turning, he regales his list'ning wifeWith all th' adventures of his early life,His skill in coachmanship or driving chaise,In bilking tavern bills and spouting plays,What shifts he used detected in a scrape,How he was flogg'd, or had the luck t' escape,What sums he lost at play, and how he soldWatch, seals, and all, 'till all his pranks are told.Retracing thus his frolics ('tis a nameThat palliates deeds of folly and of shame)He gives the local biass all its sway,Resolves that where he play'd his sons shall play,
And destines their bright genius to be shownJust in the scene where he display'd his own.The meek and bashful boy will soon be taughtTo be as bold and forward as he ought,The rude will scuffle through with ease enough,Great schools suit best the sturdy and the rough.Ah happy designation, prudent choice,Th' event is sure, expect it and rejoice!Soon see your wish fulfilled in either child,The pert made perter, and the tame made wild.The great indeed, by titles, riches, birth,Excused th' incumbrance of more solid worth,Are best disposed of, where with most successThey may acquire that confident address,Those habits of profuse and lew'd expence,That scorn of all delights but those of sense,Which though in plain plebeians we condemn,With so much reason all expect from them.
But families of less illustrious fame,Whose chief distinction is their spotless name,Whose heirs, their honours none, their income small,Must shine by true desert, or not at all,What dream they of, that with so little careThey risk their hopes, their dearest treasure there?They dream of little Charles or William gracedWith wig prolix, down-flowing to his waist,They see th' attentive crowds his talents draw,They hear him speak—the oracle of law.The father who designs his babe a priest,Dreams him episcopally such at least,And while the playful jockey scow'rs the roomBriskly, astride upon the parlour broom,In fancy sees him more superbly rideIn coach with purple lined, and mitres on its side.Events improbable and strange as these,Which only a parental eye foresees,A public school shall bring to pass with ease.
But how? resides such virtue in that airAs must create an appetite for pray'r?And will it breathe into him all the zealThat candidates for such a prize should feel,To take the lead and be the foremost stillIn all true worth and literary skill?"Ah blind to bright futurity, untaught"The knowledge of the world, and dull of thought!"Church-ladders are not always mounted best"By learned Clerks and Latinists profess'd."Th' exalted prize demands an upward look,"Not to be found by poring on a book."Small skill in Latin, and still less in Greek,"Is more than adequate to all I seek,"Let erudition grace him or not grace,"I give the bawble but the second place,"His wealth, fame, honors, all that I intend,"Subsist and center in one point—a friend."A friend, whate'er he studies or neglects,"Shall give him consequence, heal all defects,
"His intercourse with peers, and sons of peers—"There dawns the splendour of his future years,"In that bright quarter his propitious skies"Shall blush betimes, and there his glory rise."Your Lordship and your Grace, what school can teach"A rhet'ric equal to those parts of speech?"What need of Homer's verse or Tully's prose,"Sweet interjections! if he learn but those?"Let rev'rend churls his ignorance rebuke,"Who starve upon a dogs-ear'd Pentateuch,"The parson knows enough who knows a Duke."—Egregious purpose! worthily begunIn barb'rous prostitution of your son,Pressed on his part by means that would disgraceA scriv'ners clerk or footman out of place,And ending, if at last its end be gained,In sacrilege, in God's own house profaned.It may succeed; and if his sins should callFor more than common punishment, it shall.
The wretch shall rise, and be the thing on earthLeast qualified in honor, learning, worth,To occupy a sacred, awful post,In which the best and worthiest tremble most.The royal letters, are a thing of course,A king that would, might recommend his horse,And Deans no doubt and Chapters, with one voiceAs bound in duty, would confirm the choice.Behold your Bishop! well he plays his part,Christian in name, and Infidel in heart,Ghostly in office, earthly in his plan,A slave at court, elsewhere a lady's man,Dumb as a senator, and as a priestA piece of mere church-furniture at best;To live estranged from God his total scope,And his end sure, without one glimpse of hope.But fair although and feasible it seem,Depend not much upon your golden dream;For Providence that seems concern'd t' exemptThe hallow'd bench from absolute contempt,
In spite of all the wrigglers into place,Still keeps a seat or two for worth and grace,And therefore 'tis, that, though the sight be rare,We sometimes see a Lowth or Bagot there.Besides, school-friendships are not always found,Though fair in promise, permanent and sound.The most disint'rested and virtuous mindsIn early years connected, time unbinds.New situations give a diff'rent castOf habit, inclination, temper, taste,And he that seem'd our counterpart at first,Soon shows the strong similitude revers'd.Young heads are giddy, and young hearts are warm,And make mistakes for manhood to reform.Boys are at best but pretty buds unblown,Whose scent and hues are rather guess'd than known.Each dreams that each is just what he appears,But learns his error in maturer years,When disposition like a sail unfurl'dShows all its rents and patches to the world.
If therefore, ev'n when honest in design,A boyish friendship may so soon decline,'Twere wiser sure t' inspire a little heartWith just abhorrence of so mean a part,Than set your son to work at a vile tradeFor wages so unlikely to be paid.Our public hives of puerile resortThat are of chief and most approved report,To such base hopes in many a sordid soulOwe their repute in part, but not the whole.A principle, whose proud pretensions passUnquestioned, though the jewel be but glass,That with a world not often over-niceRanks as a virtue, and is yet a vice,Or rather a gross compound, justly tried,Of envy, hatred, jealousy, and pride,Contributes most perhaps t' inhance their fame,And Emulation is its specious name.
Boys once on fire with that contentious zealFeel all the rage that female rivals feel,The prize of beauty in a woman's eyesNot brighter than in theirs the scholar's prize.The spirit of that competition burnsWith all varieties of ill by turns,Each vainly magnifies his own success,Resents his fellows, wishes it were less,Exults in his miscarriage if he fail,Deems his reward too great if he prevail,And labors to surpass him day and night,Less for improvement, than to tickle spite.The spur is pow'rful, and I grant its force,It pricks the genius forward in its course,Allows short time for play, and none sor sloth,And felt alike by each, advances both,But judge where so much evil intervenes,The end, though plausible, not worth the means.Weigh, for a moment, classical desertAgainst an heart depraved and temper hurt,
Hurt too perhaps for life, for early wrongDone to the nobler part, affects it long,And you are staunch indeed in learning's cause,If you can crown a discipline that drawsSuch mischiefs after it, with much applause.Connection form'd for int'rest, and endear'dBy selfish views, thus censured and cashier'd,And emulation, as engend'ring hate,Doom'd to a no less ignominious fate,The props of such proud seminaries fall,The JACHIN and the BOAZ of them all.Great schools rejected then, as those that swellBeyond a size that can be managed well,Shall royal institutions miss the bays,And small academies win all the praise?Force not my drift beyond its just intent,I praise a school as Pope a government;So take my judgment in his language dress'd,"Whate'er is best administer'd, is best."
Few boys are born with talents that excel,But all are capable of living well.Then ask not, whether limited or large,But, watch they strictly, or neglect their charge?If anxious only that their boys may learn,While Morals languish, a despised concern,The great and small deserve one common blame,Diff'rent in size, but in effect the same.Much zeal in virtue's cause all teachers boast,Though motives of mere lucre sway the most.Therefore in towns and cities they abound,For there, the game they seek is easiest found,Though there, in spite of all that care can do,Traps to catch youth are most abundant too.If shrew'd, and of a well-constructed brain,Keen in pursuit, and vig'rous to retain,Your son come forth a prodigy of skill,As wheresoever taught, so form'd, he will,The paedagogue, with self-complacent air,Claims more than half the praise as his due share;
But if with all his genius he betray,Not more intelligent, than loose and gay,Such vicious habits as disgrace his name,Threaten his health, his fortune, and his fame,Though want of due restraint alone have bredThe symptoms that you see with so much dread,Unenvied there, he may sustain aloneThe whole reproach, the fault was all his own.Oh 'tis a sight to be with joy perusedBy all whom sentiment has not abused,New-fangled sentiment, the boasted graceOf those who never feel in the right place,A sight surpassed by none that we can show,Though Vestris on one leg still shine below,A father blest with an ingenuous son,Father and friend and tutour all in one.How? turn again to tales long since forgot,Aesop and Phaedrus and the rest?—why not?
He will not blush that has a father's heart,To take in childish plays a childish part,But bends his sturdy back to any toyThat youth takes pleasure in, to please his boy;Then why resign into a stranger's handA task as much within your own command,That God and nature and your int'rest tooSeem with one voice to delegate to you?Why hire a lodging in a house unknownFor one whose tend'rest thoughts all hover round your
own?This second weaning, needless as it is,How does it lacerate both your heart and his!Th' indented stick that loses day by dayNotch after notch, 'till all are smooth'd away,Bears witness long 'ere his dismission come,With what intense desire he wants his home.But though the joys he hopes beneath your roofBid fair enough to answer in the proof
Harmless and safe and nat'ral as they are,A disappointment waits him even there:Arrived, he feels an unexpected change,He blushes, hangs his head, is shy and strange,No longer takes, as once, with fearless easeHis fav'rite stand between his father's knees,But seeks the corner of some distant seat,And eyes the door, and watches a retreat,And least familiar where he should be most,Feels all his happiest privileges lost.Alas poor boy!—the natural effectOf love by absence chilled into respect.Say, what accomplishments at school acquiredBrings he to sweeten fruits so undesired?Thou well deserv'st an alienated son,Unless thy conscious heart acknowledge—none.None that in thy domestic snug recess,He had not made his own with more address,Though some perhaps that shock thy feeling mind,And better never learn'd, or left behind.
Add too, that thus estranged thou can'st obtainBy no kind arts his confidence again,That here begins with most that long complaintOf filial frankness lost, and love grown faint,Which, oft neglected in life's waning years,A parent pours into regardless ears.Like caterpillars dangling under treesBy slender threads, and swinging in the breeze,Which filthily bewray and sore disgraceThe boughs in which are bred th' unseemly race,While ev'ry worm industriously weavesAnd winds his web about the rivell'd leaves;So num'rous are the follies that annoy'The mind and heart of ev'ry sprightly boy,Imaginations noxious and perverse,Which admonition can alone disperse.Th' encroaching nuisance asks a faithful hand,Patient, affectionate, of high command,
To check the procreation of a breedSure to exhaust the plant on which they feed.'Tis not enough that Greek or Roman pageAt stated hours his freakish thoughts engage,Ev'n in his pastimes he requires a friendTo warn, and teach him safely to unbend,O'er all his pleasures gently to preside,Watch his emotions and controul their tide,And levying thus, and with an easy sway,A tax of profit from his very play,T' impress a value not to be eras'dOn moments squander'd else, and running all to waste.And seems it nothing in a father's eyeThat unimproved those many moments fly?And is he well content, his son should findNo nourishment to feed his growing mindBut conjugated verbs, and nouns declined?For such is all the mental food purvey'dBy public hacknies in the schooling trade,
Who feed a pupils intellect with storeOf syntax truely, but with little more,Dismiss their cares when they dismiss their flock,Machines themselves, and govern'd by a clock.Perhaps a father blest with any brainsWould deem it no abuse or waste of pains,T' improve this diet at no great expence,With sav'ry truth and wholesome common sense.To lead his son for prospects of delightTo some not steep, though philosophic height,Thence to exhibit to his wondering eyesYon circling worlds, their distance, and their size,The moons of Jove and Saturn's belted ball,And the harmonious order of them all;To show him in an insect or a flow'r,Such microscopic proofs of skill and pow'r,As hid from ages pass'd, God now displaysTo combat Atheists with in modern days;To spread the earth before him, and commendWith designation of the fingers end
Its various parts to his attentive note,Thus bringing home to him the most remote;To teach his heart to glow with gen'rous flameCaught from the deeds of men of ancient fame,And more than all, with commendation dueTo set some living worthy in his view,Whose fair example may at once inspireA wish to copy what he must admire.Such knowledge gained betimes, and which appearsThough solid, not too weighty for his years,Sweet in itself, and not forbidding sport,When health demands it, of athletic sort,Would make him what some lovely boys have been,And more than one perhaps that I have seen,An evidence and reprehension bothOf the mere school-boy's lean and tardy growth.Art thou a man professionally tied,With all thy faculties elsewhere applied,
Too busy to intend a meaner careThan how to enrich thyself, and next, thine heir;Or art thou (as though rich, perhaps thou art)But poor in knowledge, having none to impart—Behold that figure, neat, though plainly clad,His sprightly mingled with a shade of sad,Not of a nimble tongue, though now and thenHeard to articulate like other men,No jester, and yet lively in discourse,His phrase well chosen, clear, and full of force,And his address, if not quite French in ease,Not English stiff, but frank and formed to please,Low in the world because he scorns its arts,A man of letters, manners, morals, parts,Unpatronized, and therefore little known,Wise for himself and his few friends alone,In him, thy well appointed proxy see,Armed for a work too difficult for thee,Prepared by taste, by learning, and true worth,To form thy son, to strike his genius forth,
Beneath thy roof, beneath thine eye to proveThe force of discipline when back'd by love,To double all thy pleasure in thy child,His mind informed, his morals undefiled.Safe under such a wing, the boy shall showNo spots contracted among grooms below,Nor taint his speech with meannesses design'dBy footman Tom for witty and refin'd.There—in his commerce with the liveried herdLurks the contagion chiefly to be fear'd.For since (so fashion dictates) all who claimAn higher than a mere plebeian fame,Find it expedient, come what mischief may,To entertain a thief or two in pay,And they that can afford th' expence of more,Some half a dozen, and some half a score,Great cause occurs to save him from a bandSo sure to spoil him, and so near at hand,A point secured, if once he be suppliedWith some such Mentor always at his side.
Are such men rare? perhaps they would aboundWere occupation easier to be found,Were education, else so sure to fail,Conducted on a manageable scale,And schools that have outlived all just esteem,Exchang'd for the secure domestie scheme.But having found him, be thou duke or earl,Show thou hast sense enough to prize the pearl,And as thou would'st th' advancement of thine heirIn all good faculties beneath his care,Respect, as is but rational and just,A man deem'd worthy of so dear a trust.Despised by thee, what more can he expectFrom youthful folly, than the same neglect?A flat and fatal negative obtainsThat instant, upon all his future pains;His lessons tire, his mild rebukes offend,And all the instructions of thy son's best friendAre a stream choak'd, or trickling to no end.
Doom him not then to solitary meals,But recollect that he has sense, and feels.And, that possessor of a soul refin'd,An upright heart and cultivated mind,His post not mean, his talents not unknown,He deems it hard to vegetate alone.And if admitted at thy board he sit,Account him no just mark for idle wit,Offend not him whom modesty restrainsFrom repartee, with jokes that he disdains,Much less transfix his feelings with an oath,Nor frown, unless he vanish with the cloth.—And trust me, his utility may reachTo more than he is hired or bound to teach,Much trash unutter'd and some ills undone,Through rev'rence of the censor of thy son.But if thy table be indeed unclean,Foul with excess, and with discourse obscene,
And thou a wretch, whom, following her old planThe world accounts an honourable man,Because forsooth thy courage has been triedAnd stood the test, perhaps on the wrong side,Though thou hadst never grace enough to proveThat any thing but vice could win thy love;Or hast thou a polite, card-playing wife,Chained to the routs that she frequents, for life,Who, just when industry begins to snore,Flies, wing'd with joy, to some coach-crouded door,And thrice in ev'ry winter throngs thine ownWith half the chariots and sedans in town,Thyself meanwhile e'en shifting as thou may'st,Not very sober though, nor very chaste;Or is thine house, though less superb thy rank,If not a scene of pleasure, a mere blank,And thou at best, and in thy sob'rest mood,A trifler, vain, and empty of all good?Though mercy for thyself thou can'st have none,Hear nature plead, show mercy to thy son.
Saved from his home, where ev'ry day brings forthSome mischief fatal to his future worth,Find him a better in a distant spot,Within some pious pastor's humble cot,Where vile example (your's I chiefly mean,The most seducing and the oft'nest seen)May never more be stamp'd upon his breastNot yet perhaps incurably impress'd.Where early rest makes early rising sure,Disease or comes not, or finds easy cure,Prevented much by diet neat and plain,Or if it enter, soon starved out again.Where all th' attention of his faithful hostDiscreetly limited to two at most,May raise such fruits as shall reward his care,And not at last evaporate in air.Where stillness aiding study, and his mindSerene, and to his duties much inclined,Not occupied in day-dreams, as at home,Of pleasures past or follies yet to come,
His virtuous toil may terminate at lastIn settled habit and decided taste.But whom do I advise? the fashion-led,Th' incorrigibly wrong, the deaf, the dead,Whom care and cool deliberation suitNot better much, than spectacles a brute,Who if their sons some slight tuition share,Deem it of no great moment, whose, or where,Too proud t' adopt the thoughts of one unknown,And much too gay t' have any of their own.But courage man! methought the muse replied,Mankind are various, and the world is wide;The ostrich, silliest of the feather'd kind,And form'd of God without a parent's mind,Commits her eggs, incautious, to the dust,Forgetful that the foot may crush the trust;And while on public nurs'ries they rely,Not knowing, and too oft not caring why,Irrational in what they thus prefer,No few, that would seem wise, resemble her.
But all are not alike. Thy warning voiceMay here and there prevent erroneous choice,And some perhaps, who, busy as they are,Yet make their progeny their dearest care,Whose hearts will ache once told what ills may reachTheir offspring left upon so wild a beach,Will need no stress of argument t' inforceTh' expedience of a less advent'rous course.The rest will slight thy counsel, or condemn,But they have human feelings. Turn to them.To you then, tenants of life's middle state,Securely placed between the small and great,Whose character, yet undebauch'd, retainsTwo thirds of all the virtue that remains,Who wise yourselves, desire your sons should learnYour wisdom and your ways—to you I turn.Look round you on a world perversely blind,See what contempt is fall'n on human kind,
See wealth abused, and dignities misplac'd,Great titles, offices, and trusts disgrac'd,Long lines of ancestry renown'd of old,Their noble qualities all quench'd and cold,See Bedlam's closetted and hand-cuff'd chargeSurpass'd in frenzy by the mad at large,See great commanders making war a trade,Great lawyers, lawyers without study made,Churchmen, in whose esteem their blest employIs odious, and their wages all their joy,Who far enough from furnishing their shelvesWith gospel lore, turn infidels themselves,See womanhood despised, and manhood shamedWith infamy too nauseous to be named,Fops at all corners lady-like in mien,Civetted fellows, smelt 'ere they are seen,Else coarse and rude in manners, and their tongueOn fire with curses and with nonsense hung,Now flush'd with drunk'ness, now with whoredom pale,Their breath a sample of last night's regale,
See volunteers in all the vilest artsMen well endowed, of honourable parts,Design'd by nature wise, but self-made fools;All these, and more like these, were bred at schools.And if it chance, as sometimes chance it will,That though school-bred, the boy be virtuous still,Such rare exceptions shining in the dark,Prove rather than impeach the just remark,As here and there a twinkling star descriedServes but to show how black is all beside.Now look on him whose very voice in toneJust echos thine, whose features are thine own,And stroke his polish'd cheek of purest red,And lay thine hand upon his flaxen head,And say, my boy, th' unwelcome hour is come,When thou, transplanted from thy genial homeMust find a colder soil and bleaker air,And trust for safety to a stranger's care;What character, what turn thou wilt assumeFrom constant converse with I know not whom,
Who there will court thy friendship, with what views,And, artless as thou art, whom thou wilt chuse,Though much depends on what thy choice shall be,Is all chance-medley and unknown to me.Can'st thou, the tear just trembling on thy lids,And while the dreadful risque foreseen, forbids,Free too, and under no constraining force,Unless the sway of custom warp thy course,Lay such a stake upon the losing side,Merely to gratify so blind a guide?Thou can'st not: Nature pulling at thine heartCondemns th' unfatherly, th' imprudent part.Thou would'st not, deaf to Nature's tend'rest plea,Turn him adrift upon a rolling sea,Nor say, go thither, conscious that there layA brood of asps, or quicksands in his way,Then only govern'd by the self-same ruleOf nat'ral pity, send him not to school.No—Guard him better; Is he not thine own,Thyself in miniature, thy flesh, thy bone?
And hopest thou not ('tis ev'ry father's hope)That since thy strength must with thy years elope;And thou wilt need some comfort to assuageHealth's last farewell, a staff of thine old age,That then, in recompense of all thy cares,Thy child shall show respect to thy grey hairs,Befriend thee of all other friends bereft,And give thy life its only cordial left?Aware then how much danger intervenes,To compass that good end, forecast the means.His heart, now passive, yields to thy command;Secure it thine. Its key is in thine hand.If thou desert thy charge and throw it wide,Nor heed what guests there enter and abide,Complain not if attachments lewd and baseSupplant thee in it, and usurp thy place.But if thou guard its sacred chambers sureFrom vicious inmates and delights impure,Either his gratitude shall hold him fast,And keep him warm and filial to the last,
Or if he prove unkind, (as who can sayBut being man, and therefore frail, he may)One comfort yet shall cheer thine aged heart,Howe'er he slight thee, thou hast done thy part.Oh barb'rous! would'st thou with a Gothic handPull down the schools—what!—all the schools i' th' land?Or throw them up to liv'ry-nags and grooms,Or turn them into shops and auction-rooms?A captious question, sir, and your's is one,Deserves an answer similar, or none.Would'st thou, possessor of a flock, employ(Apprized that he is such) a careless boy,And feed him well and give him handsome pay,Merely to sleep, and let them run astray?Survey our schools and colleges, and seeA sight not much unlike my simile.From education, as the leading cause,The public character its colour draws,
Thence the prevailing manners take their cast,Extravagant or sober, loose or chaste.And though I would not advertize them yet,Nor write on each—This Building to be Lett,Unless the world were all prepared to embraceA plan well-worthy to supply their place,Yet backward as they are, and long have been,To cultivate and keep the MORALS clean,(Forgive the crime) I wish them, I confess,Or better managed, or encouraged less.THE DIVERTING
HISTORY
OF
JOHN GILPIN,
SHEWING HOW HE WENT FARTHER THAN HE
INTENDED AND CAME SAFE HOME AGAIN.JOHN Gilpin was a citizenOf credit and renown,A train-band Captain eke was heOf famous London town.John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear,Though wedded we have beenThese twice ten tedious years, yet weNo holiday have seen.To-morrow is our wedding-day,And we will then repairUnto the Bell at EdmontonAll in a chaise and pair.My sister and my sister's child,My self and children threeWill fill the chaise, so you must rideOn horse-back after we.He soon replied, I do admireOf womankind but one,And you are she, my dearest dear,Therefore it shall be done.I am a linnen-draper bold,As all the world doth know,And my good friend the CallenderWill lend his horse to go.Quoth Mrs. Gilpin, that's well said;And for that wine is dear,We will be furnish'd with our own,Which is both bright and clear.John Gilpin kiss'd his loving wife,O'erjoy'd was he to findThat though on pleasure she was bent,She had a frugal mind.The morning came, the chaise was brought,But yet was not allow'dTo drive up to the door, lest allShould say that she was proud.So three doors off the chaise was stay'd,Where they did all get in,Six precious souls, and all agogTo dash through thick and thin.Smack went the whip, round went the Were never folk so glad,The stones did rattle underneathAs if Cheapside were mad.John Gilpin at his horse's sideSeized fast the flowing main,And up he got in haste to ride,But soon came down again.For saddle-tree scarce reach'd had he,His journey to begin,When turning round his head he sawThree customers come in.So down he came, for loss of timeAlthough it grieved him sore,Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,Would trouble him much more:'Twas long before the customersWere suited to their mind,When Betty screaming came down stairs,"The wine is left behind."Good lack! quoth he, yet bring it me,My leathern belt likewiseIn which I bear my trusty swordWhen I do exercise.Now Mistress Gilpin, careful soul,Had two stone bottles found,To hold the liquor that she loved,And keep it safe and sound.Each bottle had a curling earThrough which the belt he drew,And hung a bottle on each sideTo make his balance true.Then over all, that he might beEquipp'd from top to toe,His long red cloak well brush'd and neatHe manfully did throw.Now see him mounted once againUpon his nimble steed,Full slowly pacing o'er the stonesWith caution and good heed.But finding soon a smoother roadBeneath his well-shod feet,The snorting beast began to trot,Which gall'd him in his seat.So fair and softly, John he cried,But John he cried in vain,That trot became a gallop soonIn spite of curb and rein.So stooping down, as needs he mustWho cannot sit upright,He grasp'd the mane with both his handsAnd eke with all his might.His horse who never in that sortHad handled been before,What thing upon his back had gotDid wonder more and more.Away went Gilpin neck or nought,Away went hat and wig,He little dreamt when he set outOf running such a rig.The wind did blow, the cloak did fly,Like streamer long and gay,'Till loop and button failing bothAt last it flew away.Then might all people well discernThe bottles he had slung,A bottle swinging at each sideAs hath been said or sung.The dogs did bark, the children scream'd;Up flew the windows all,And ev'ry soul cried out, well done,As loud as he could bawl.Away went Gilpin—who but he;His fame soon spread around—He carries weight, he rides a race,'Tis for a thousand pound.And still as fast as he drew near,'Twas wonderful to viewHow in a trice the turnpike-menTheir gates wide open threw:And now as he went bowing downHis reeking head full low,The bottles twain behind his backWere shatter'd at a blow.Down ran the wine into the roadMost piteous to be seen,Which made his horse's flanks to smokeAs they had basted been.But still he seem'd to carry weight,With leathern girdle braced,For all might see the bottle necksStill dangling at his waist.Thus all through merry IslingtonThese gambols he did play,And till he came unto the washOf Edmonton so gay.And there he threw the wash aboutOn both sides of the way,Just like unto a trundling mop,Or a wild-goose at play.At Edmonton his loving wifeFrom the balcony spiedHer tender husband, wond'ring muchTo see how he did ride.Stop, stop John Gilpin!—Here's the house—They all at once did cry,The dinner waits and we are tir'd,Said Gilpin—so am I.But yet his horse was not a whitInclined to tarry there,For why? his owner had a houseFull ten miles off at Ware.So like an arrow swift he flewShot by an archer strong,So did he fly—which brings me toThe middle of my song.Away went Gilpin, out of breath,And sore against his will,Till at his friend's the Callender'sHis horse at last stood still.The Callender amazed to seeHis neighbour in such trim,Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,And thus accosted him.What news, what news, your tidings tell,Tell me you must and shall—Say why bare headed you are come,Or why you come at all.Now Gilpin had a pleasant witAnd loved a timely joke,And thus unto the CallenderIn merry guise he spoke.I came because your horse would come,And if I well forebode,My hat and wig will soon be here,They are upon the road.The Callender right glad to findHis friend in merry pin,Return'd him not a single word,But to the house went in.Whence strait he came with hat and wig,A wig that flow'd behind,A hat not much the worse for wear,Each comely in its kind.He held them up, and in his turnThus show'd his ready wit,My head is twice as big as yours,They therefore needs must fit.But let me scrape the dirt awayThat hangs upon your face,And stop and eat, for well you mayBe in a hungry case.Said John, it is my wedding-day,And all the world would stare,If wife should dine at EdmontonAnd I should dine at Ware.So turning to his horse, he said,I am in haste to dine,'Twas for your pleasure you came here▪You shall go back for mine.Ah luckless speech, and bootless boast!For which he paid full dear,For while he spake a braying assDid sing most loud and clear.Whereat his horse did snort as heHad heard a lion roar,And gallop'd off with all his mightAs he had done before.Away went Gilpin and awayWent Gilpin's hat and wig;He lost them sooner than at first,For why? they were too big.Now, Mistress Gilpin when she saw,Her husband posting downInto the country far away,She pull'd out half a crown.And thus unto the youth she saidThat drove them to the Bell,This shall be yours when you bring backMy husband safe and well.The youth did ride, and soon did meetJohn coming back amain,Whom in a trice he tried to stopBy catching at his rein.But not performing what he meantAnd gladly would have done,The frighted steed he frighted more,And made him faster run.Away went Gilpin, and awayWent post-boy at his heels,The post-boy's horse right glad to missThe lumb'ring of the wheels.Six gentlemen upon the roadThus seeing Gilpin fly,With post-boy scamp'ring in the rear,They rais'd the hue and cry.Stop thief, stop thief—a highwayman!Not one of them was mute,And all and each that pass'd that wayDid join in the pursuit.And now the turnpike gates againFlew open in short space,The toll-men thinking as beforeThat Gilpin rode a race.And so he did and won it too,For he got first to town,Nor stopp'd 'till where he had got upHe did again get down.Now let us sing, long live the king,And Gilpin long live he,And when he next doth ride abroad,May I be there to see!FINIS.Lately published by the same Author, in one Volume of this Size,
