A POEM Sacred to the MEMORY of SIR ISAAC NEWTON.By JAMES THOMSON.His Tibi me Rebus quaedam divina VoluptasPercipit, atque Horror; quòd sic Natura tuâ ViTam manifesta patet ex omni Parte retecta.LUC.DUBLIN: Printed by S. POWELL, for RICHARD NORRIS, at the Corner of Crane-lane in Essex-street, M DCC XXVII.Where may be had Summer a Poem, and Winter a Poem.To the Right Honourable Sir Robert Walpole, KNIGHT of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.SIR,SINCE I have ventur'd to write a Poem on a Gentleman who is universally acknowledg'd to be the Honour of our Country as a Philosopher, prompted by the same Ambition, I address it to her most illustrious Patriot.Tho', by the wise Choice of the best of Kings, you are engag'd in the highest and most active Scenes of Life, balancing the Power of Europe, watching over our common Welfare, informing the whole Body of Society and Commerce, and even like Heaven dispensing Happiness to the Discontented

and Ungrateful; tho' thus gloriously employ'd, yet are you not less attentive, in the Hour of Leisure, to the Variety, Beauty, and Magnificence of Nature, nor less delighted, and astonish'd at the Discoveries of the incomparable Newton. The same comprehensive Genius which Way soever it looks must have a steady, clear, and unbounded Prospect.But not to encroach any further on your important Moments all devoted to the Good of Mankind, I once more plead the Dignity of my Subject for my Excuse in this Approach, and beg Leave to subscribe my self, with the sincerest Veneration,SIR,Your most faithful, humble Servant, JAMES THOMSON.A POEM Sacred to the Memory of Sir ISAAC NEWTON.SHALL the great Soul of NEWTON quit this Earth,To mingle with his Stars, and every Muse,Astonish'd into Silence, shun the WeightOf Honours due to his illustrious Name!But what can Man?—Even now the Sons of Light,
In Strains such as delight the Ear of GOD,Hail his Arrival on the Coasts of Bliss.Yet am not I deterr'd, tho' high the Theme,And sung to Harps of Angels; for with you,Aetherial Flames! ambitious I aspireIn Nature's general Symphony to join.AND what new Wonders can ye show your Guest!Who, while on this dim Spot where Mortals toilClouded in Dust, from Motion's simple LawsCould trace the boundless Hand of Providence,Wide-working thro' this universal Frame.HAVE ye not listen'd while he bound the Suns,And Planets to their Spheres! Th' unequal TaskOf Humankind till then. Oft had they roll'dO'er erring Man the Year, and oft disgrac'dThe Pride of Schools, before their Course was knownFull in its Causes and Effects to Him,All-piercing Sage! Who sat not down and dreamtRomantic Schemes, defended by the DinOf specious Words, and Tyranny of Names,But bidding his amazing Mind attend,
And with heroick Patience Years on YearsDeep-searching, saw at last the System dawn,And shine, of all his Race, on him alone.WHAT were his Raptures then! how pure! how strong!And what the Triumphs of old Greece and Rome,By his diminish'd, but the Pride of BoysIn some small Fray victorious! When insteadOf shatter'd Parcels of this Earth usurp'dBy Violence unmanly, and sore DeedsOf Cruelty and Blood, Nature herselfStood all subdu'd by him, and open laidHer every latent Glory to his View.AND first our solar System he survey'dWith accurate Ken, and by the mingling PowerOf Gravitation and Projection sawThe whole in silent Harmony revolve.Drawn to his lengthen'd Eye th' attending Moons,Design'd to chear remoter Planets, wereBy him in all their mix'd Proportions seen.He also fix'd the wandering Queen of Night,Whether she wanes into a scanty Orb▪
Or waxing broad with her pale shadowy LightIn a soft Deluge overflows the Sky.Her every Motion clear discerning, HeAdjusted to th' obsequious Main, and taughtWhy now the mighty Mass of Waters swellsResistless, heaving on the broken Rocks,And the full River turning; till againThe Tide revertive, unattracted, leavesA Yellow Waste of idle Sands behind.THEN breaking hence, he took his ardent FlightThro' the blue Infinite; and every Star,Which the clear Concave of a Winter's NightPours on the Eye, or Astronomic Tube,Far-stretching, snatches from the dark Abyss,Or such as farther in successive SkiesTo Fancy only shine, at his ApproachBlaz'd into Suns. Th' enlivening Centre eachOf an harmonious System. All, combin'd,And rul'd unerring by that single PowerWhich draws the Stone projected to the Ground.O UNPROFUSE Magnificence divine!O Wisdom truly perfect! thus to call
From a few Causes such a Scheme of Things,Effects so various, beautiful, and great,An Universe compleat! And O Belov'dOf Heaven! into th' Almighty's Councils thusTo be admitted, and allow'd to scanThe rising, moving, wide-establish'd Frame.HE too, unbaffled in his Aim, pursu'dThe Comet to' the long Elliptic Curve,As round innumerous Worlds he wound his Way,Till to the Forehead of the Evening-SkyReduc'd, the blazing Wonder glares anew.THE Heavens are all his own. Finish'd by himThe fair Discovery lies; and every EyeMay lay the useless Telescope aside,Unless it be to hold the great AcquestsBy Newton made: Who from the wild DomainOf the Des Cartes.French Dreamer rescu'd Heaven and Earth.All Europe stood appall'd; but found it vainTo keep at Odds with Demonstration strong,
And lingering to resist the awakening ForceOf Truth. At once their pleasing Visions fled,With the gay Shadows of the Morning mix'd,When Newton rose, our Philosophic Sun.TH' Aerial Flow of Sound was known to Him,From whence it first in wavy Circles breaks,Till the touch'd Organ takes the Message in.Nor could the darting Beam, of Speed immense,Escape his swift Pursuit, and measuring Glance.Even Light it self, which every thing displays,Shone undiscover'd, till his brighter MindUntwisted all the shining Robe of Day;And from the whitening, undistinguish'd Blaze,Collecting every Ray into his Kind,To the charm'd Eye educ'd the gorgeous TrainOf Parent-Colours. First the flaming RedSprung vivid forth; the tawny Orange next;And then delicious Yellow; by whose SideFell the kind Beams of all-refreshing Green.Then the pure Blue that swells autumnal SkiesAetherial play'd; and then of sadder HueEmergd the deepen'd Indico, as whenThe heavy-skirted Evening droops with Frost.
While the last Gleanings of refracted LightDy'd in the fainting Violetaway.These, when the Clouds distil the rosy Shower,Shine out distinct adown the watry Bow,While o'er our Heads the dewy Vision bendsDelightful, melting on the Fields beneath.Myriads of mingling Dies from these result,And Myriads still remain, th' exhaustless SourceOf Beauty ever-flushing, ever-new!DID ever Poet image ought so fair,Dreaming in whispering Groves, by the hoarse Brook!Or Prophet, to whose Rapture Heav'n descends!Even now the setting Sun and liveri'd Clouds,Seen, Greenwich, from thy lovely Heights, declareHow just, how beauteous the refractive Law.THE noiseless Tide of Time, all bearing downTo vast Eternity's unbounded SeaWhere the green Islands of the Happy shine,He backward stem'd alone; and to it's SourceAscending, mark'd it's Periods, and hung outHis Lights at equal Distances to guideHistorian, wilder'd on his darksome Way.BUT who can number up his Labours? WhoHis high Discoveries sing? When but a fewOf the deep-studying Race can stretch their MindsTo image what he knew, as clear as theyThe Truths self-evident with which he link'dHis far thest Views. For is there ought that's great.That's wonderful, and hard, deterring Search?That was his Prize! and worthy of his ToilUnfailing, Who the lonely Monarch reign'dOf Science thin-inhabited below.WHAT Wonder then that his Devotion swell'dResponsive to his Knowledge! For could he,Whose piercing mental Eye diffusive sawThe finish'd University of Things,In all its Order, Magnitude, and Parts,Forbear incessant to adore that PowerWho fills, sustains, and actuates the whole.SAY, ye who best can tell, ye happy few,Who saw him in the softest Lights of Life,All unwithheld, indulging to his FriendsThe vast, unborrow'd Treasures of his Mind.O speak the wondrous Man! how mild, how calm,
How greatly humble, how divinely good,How firm, establish'd on eternal Truth,Pure as his Faith, and active as his Love,Fervent in doing well, with every NerveStill pressing on, forgetful of the Past,And panting for Perfection! far aboveThose little Cares, and visionary JoysThat so befool the fond, impassion'd HeartOf over-cheated, ever-trusting Man.AND say, ye downward, gloomy-minded Tribe,Ye who, unconscious of those nobler FlightsThat reach impatient at immortal Life,Against the Prime, indearing PrivilegeOf Being dare contend, say can a SoulOf such extensive, deep, tremendous Powers▪Enlarging still, be but a finer BreathOf Spirits dancing thro' their Tubes awhile▪And then for ever lost in vacant Air?BUT hark! Methinks I hear a warning Voice,Solemn as when some awful Change is come,Sound thro' the World—"He's dead.—The Measure's full,"And I resign my Charge.—Ye mouldering Stones
That build the towring Pyramid, the proudTriumphal Arch, the Monument effac'dBy ruthless Ruin, and whate'er supportsThe worship'd Name of grey Antiquity,Down to the Dust! What Grandeur can ye boastWhile Newton lifts his Column to the SkiesBeyond the Waste of Time!—Let no weak DropBe shed for him. The Beauty in her BloomCut off, the Joyous Youth, and darling Child,These are the Tombs that claim the tender Tear,And Elegiac Song, but Newton callsFor other Notes of Gratulation high,That now he wanders thro' those endless WorldsHe here so well descry'd, and wondering talks,And Hymns their Author with his glad Compeers.O BRITAIN'S Boast! Whether with Angels thouSittest in dread Discourse, or Fellow SaintsWho joy to see the Honour of their Kind;Or whether mounted on Cherubic Wing,Thy swift Career is with the whirling Spheres,Comparing Things with Things, in Rapture lostAnd lowly Adoration for that LightSo plenteous ray'd into thy Mind below,
From Light himself, O look with Pity downOn Humankind, a frail, erroncous Race!Asswage the Madness of a frantic World!But chiefly o'er thy Country's Cause preside,And be her Genius call'd! Her Council steer,Correct her Manners, and inspire her Youth!For, guilty as she is, she brought thee forth,And glorious in thy Name; she points thee outTo all her Sons, and bids them eye thy Star:While in Expectance of th' arrousing Blast,When Time shall be no more, thy sacred DustSleeps with her Kings, and dignifies the Scene.THE END.BOOKS Printed for and Sold by Richard Norris, at the Corner of Crane-lane in Essex-street.MRs.
