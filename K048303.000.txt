MIDAS: AN English Burletta.[Price Eighteen-pence.]MIDAS; AN English Burletta.As it is performed, at the THEATRE-ROYAL, IN COVENT-GARDEN.LONDON: Printed, for G. KEARSLY, W. GRIFFIN, J. COOTE, T. LOWNDS, and W. NICOLE.M DCC LXIV.To the READER.THE Editor of the following piece thinks proper to observe, that the first idea of it was conceived, and the plan in some measure executed by a gentleman in Dublin, for the private entertainment of some persons of distinction in that kingdom, at a time, when Italian Burlettas were blended with the exhibitions of the Theatre, and almost triumphed over the best productions in our language. The public spirit of those, for whom it was originally intended, prevailed upon the author to enlarge his design. Accordingly, MIDAS adventured on the stage, and met with uncommon success for a series of nights. The Editor begs leave to add a word concerning the stile which prevails in the following scenes. They are written in the true spirit of the mock-heroic. BURLESQUE, in all times, from the stage of ATHENS down to the DRAGON OF WANTLEY, has been esteemed one of the provinces of the Drama. It's

humour principally consists in making dignified personages raise in our minds trite and ordinary ideas, or else in giving to trivial objects a serious air of gravity and importance.It would be impertinent to point out instances in either way of composition; but thus much was deemed necessary that no one should look for another sort of entertainment than was here intended. The public, with their usual candour, will consider the particular scope of this piece, and will decide nothing till they have heard the musick, to which it is adapted. Should MIDAS in the representation be found to have merit, and indeed, excellence in its kind; the generous critick will allow the author that degree of applause, which his talents seem to deserve.Dramatis Personae.Jupiter, Mr. Legg.Juno, Mrs. Stephens.Apollo, Mr. Mattocks.Momus, Mr. Dibden.Mercury, Mr. Baker.Pan, Mr. Dunstall.Mutes.Mars,Vulcan,Venus,Minerva, &c, &c.MORTALS.Midas, Mr. Shuter.Damaetas, Mr. Fawcett.Sileno, Mr. Beard.Mysis, Miss Poitier.Daphne, Miss Miller.Nysa, Miss Hallam.Oracle, Mr.WayleSCENE, first on mount Olympus, afterwards on the pastures of Lydia.MIDAS.ACT I.The curtain rising discovers the Heathen Deities, seated amidst the clouds, in full council: they address Jupiter in chorus, accompanied by all the instruments.AIR I.

SCENE A Champaign country with a distant village; violent storm of thunder and lightning. Shepherds sleeping in the field are rouzed by it and run away frighted. One leaves his cloak, hat, and guittar behind him.
