AMANA. A Dramatic Poem.Libertas, et natale solum.By a LADY.LONDON: Printed by T. HARRISON; For W. JOHNSTON in Ludgate-Street. MDCCLXIV.PREFACE.THE story of this piece is taken from the moral and ingenious writings, lately published, stiled THE ADVENTURER, Numbers 72 and 73. But the Drama, which was too much confined in the fable, has been inlarged here, by the addition of four persons, namely, NARDIC, ABDALLAH, FATIMA, and HAMET. For tho' NARDIC, and ABDALLAH (SANBAD, in the original) are mentioned in the story, they are not introduced into the scene.Some other alterations have been made in the fable, in order to accommodate the representation to a British audience: the machinery of genie's has been laid aside, and the catastrophé brought to pass without the declared interposition of superior agents: the time and place too, have been restrained, to preserve two of the unities. Shakespear alone could call spirits from the vasty deep; he was himself a superior intelligence; could create beings not to be found in nature or fable, could rock ages to sleep to hasten his events, and annihilate both time and space, to bring the history of a man within the representation of a day.
"Existence saw him spurn her bounded reign,"And panting time toiled after him in vain."
But modern wits are no more able to stride in Shakespear's buskin, than modern beaus to shoot in Ulysses' bow.The moral, professed in the original story, is, To shew the folly of human wishes and schemes for correcting the moral government of the world; which sentiment is preserved here in a speech of Amana's.O Nouradin!Forgive this fatal rashness—Had I staidA few short moments, we had now been blest;But wresting from the hand of providenceThe means of my escape, we both are wretched.But I confess that the reflections which occurred to my mind most strongly, on the perusal of this tale, were a tender and humane resentment of the miseries of those nations which are subject to despotic power, and an exulting sense of the peculiar blessings of liberty, that we enjoy in these thrice happy kingdoms.The contemplation of this contrast, both suggested and inspired the plan of the following writing; in which I have endeavoured to contribute my grateful mite of praise to those laws, and to that government, under which our superior advantages are established, defended, and preserved; and however the presumption of this attempt may be condemned, I hope that the faults of the performance may be pardoned, as the first essay ofA Woman.To the RIGHT HONOURABLE The Countess of Northumberland.MADAM,I Beg leave to lay at your ladyship's feet a work, which from the spirit of liberty it attempts to breathe, may hope for the honour of your patronage. Your ladyship's own character justifies this address, and the names of PERCY and SEYMOUR demand it. History is my voucher, and fame my herald. Liberty was their crest, and Glory their motto.BUT such an heroic subject is beyond my strength, and I shall content myself with praising and admiring the more social and amiable virtues of your ladyship, your humanity, benevolence and affability; which latter quality is the characteristic of true nobility, in opposition to that haughtiness which is frequently observable in those who have sprung from obscurity—Those who are placed on an eminence may descend, but those on a level would rise.IF this little work, the offspring of a female and unlettered pen, shall be so happy to amuse your ladyship for half an hour, it will afford the highest satisfaction to the author, who humbly presumes to hope, that your ladyship's candour will pardon whatever defects your judgment may find in this piece, for the sake of those sentiments it is intended to convey.I have the honour to be, With the profoundest respect, and humblest duty, MADAM, Your most humble and obedient servant, ELIZA GRIFFITH.LIST OF SUBSCRIBERS.A.THomas Adderly, EsqRev.

Withdraw that curtain, maid,To cure my passion, or confirm my wonder.taking hold of her.Amana.Rude stranger, hold—Caled.Nay then, I'll do it for thee.they struggle, and her veil falls off.Enter NOURADIN.Nouradin.Insolent slave, forego thy brutal hold,Or by the soul of my departed father,strikes him.This moment is thy last. Say, beauteous maid,Can you forgive this ruffian's barbarous outrage,Or shall his instant death make just attonement?Enter ABDALLAH, and Amana runs to him.Amana.O! let me hide me in my father's bosom.Abdallah.My loved Amana! my last grasp of life!What monster viler than the wildest Arab,Could dare insult thy unoffending youth,Or force thee lave thy glowing cheeks with tears?Nouradin.The slave who dared offend the angelic maid,Waits to receive his doom from her decree,And justice satisfied, too lovely fair,I hope that vassal's crime will rest on him,Absolving us from any purpose vile;Nor may the innocent attone the guilty.Amana.Injustice dwells not in a heart like mine,Nor can resentment there long hold a place.To you, my lord, my grateful thanks are due,Who rescued me from brutal violence:That wretch's rude assault I pardon, also.Let him depart unharmed.Nouradin.Excellent maid!Thy mind and body sure are of a piece,Bright emanations of the deity!Abdallah.If you from insult have preserved Amana,O! take a father's prayer, whose feeling heart,For every wrong she suffers, must drop blood:My age's darling! sole remaining stayWhich holds my frame from sinking to the grave.O! could I see that tender lilly proptBy fortune's fostering hand, or better far,Supported by the bride-groom rose, I then,With smiles would close my wearied eyes in death.Nouradin.O! if the purest flame that ever warmedA virgin heart, for such is mine to love,Unknowing of its pleasures or its pains,'Till I beheld this loveliest of her sex,And gazed my soul away. O! if a passion,Which in a moment equals that of years,Can make me worthy to possess such charms,Accept that prop, that firm support in me,Whose circling arms shall screen her from each blast,Cherish her blooming years, and nurse her age.Abdallah.Since heaven deprived me of its richest bounty,My lost Amestris, joy hath never oncePervaded this dark mansion: the busy guestNow fills each space, nor leaves me room for utterance—Generous young man! thy worth, thy wealth and power,To me are fully known, with gratitudeI willingly accept the proffered honour,If my Amana's heart feel no reluctanceTo aid her father's wish, and make us blest.But should all Egypt's monarch, from his ThroneDescending, court her to the bridal bed,If her repugnant heart refused his love,I would remit a father's stern behest,Nor force my child to splendid misery.What says Amana?Amana.My father's tenderness has been so great,That I have scarcely felt the bonds of duty,As inclination prompted every actWhich might appear obedience; and in this,The most important deed of all my life,My heart feels no reluctance to obey.Nouradin.Extatic sound! thus prostrate at thy feet,Let my full heart pour forth its grateful rapture;And by a life of love, and friendly care,Repay the happiness I now receive.Abdallah.Arise, my son, and may our holy prophetWith benign aspect smile upon your union:May long and prosperous days attend your lives,And every hour increase your mutual flame.Nouradin.This day the mourning for my father ends;From Mecca's shrine, to which in pilgrimageI went, I now return; some Angel, sure,Hath led my footsteps near this sacred fount,And in reward for filial duty paid,Hath blessed me with an husband's happy rites.With her's and your consent, to-morrow's sunShall see us joined in Hymen's constant bands.Meantime, to Cairo instant we'll repair,Where choicest ornaments shall deck my fair.Their rays inferior by thy eyes be shewn,Which shine in native modesty alone.exeunt Nouradin, Amana and Abdallah.Manet CALED.Caled.May swift destruction overtake you both,And if wronged Caled's means can lend it aid,They shall be well supplied. Thou Nouradin,Hast robbed me of this maid; I met her first,And had a prior claim. Her childish coynessWould soon have yielded to my free-est wishes,Hadst thou not intervened; while she, right woman,Preferred the fortune to the man. Nor yet,Is this the worst offence; did he not strike thee?And act the bravo's part throughout? A blow!What tho' the chance of war hath quite reversedMy outward seemings, still my pride remainsAs high, as when in Spain, my native country,I was saluted by the stile of lord.And tho' the Turk hath sold my limbs to bondage,The inward man no shackles can controul.My abject state restrains a nobler daring;Therefore I'll seek amends by cautious means,And may revenge quick animate my purpose!'Tis said that love has wings—But vengeance stillOutstrips its flight—The Cyprian queen is drawnBy doves—The bird of Jupiter's an eagle.On eagles wings my vengeance now shall speed,And in my talons grasp'd these doves shall bleed.exit.SCENE changes to a palace.Enter OSMIN.Osmin.What art thou, pomp? an airy being sure,Delusive shade! which fools alone admire,But wisemen ne'er enjoy. Even substancesGrow vain, and mock the eager grasp; the mindSated, not satisfied with blooming beauty,Lo! dull disgust pursues the tired embrace.Variety's a cheat—Instead of quickening,It only palls the taste; and sinks our relishTo depravity. The lowly cottager,Whose homely wife, made coarse by labour, restsWithin his arms, feels more of bliss than I,Who can command a thousand various fair,To inspire new wishes, and revive my ardor:But then it is submission, and not love,Which prompts their yielding—They chuse not Osmin,But obey the Sultan; while in full gustOf amorous dalliance, I but feel myselfAn happy brute, yet still a wretched man!Enter FATIMA.Osmin.Why Fatima, with ill-timed zeal and fondness,Dost thou obtrude upon my private leizure?Fatima.Blame not th'impatience of unchanging passion,Which follows where attraction leads the way:Tho' that, which once to me you urged, is dead,Mine, like the fragrant mittle, lives in frost:Thy chilling coldness may destroy its blossoms,But cannot kill the root.Osmin.These strong professions,Of never-ceasing love, sound like upbraidingsTo my tired ear—I like them not—nor thee.Fatima.Oh! do not wound me with such harsh expression;But since my once loved image hath forborneTo mark its former traces in thy bosom,Yet still, in pity to my sex's weakness,Restrain thy speech from scorn. O! spare the guiltTo thy own breast, of stabbing mine with grief;Yet leave me hope—the wretch's only solace—And let the jealous doubts of slighted love,And not thy stern decree, pronounce my doom.Oh! suffer me to gaze sometimes in rapture,Upon my sovereign's face; to hear that voice,Which whilom used to inspire my soul with joy,And ease my heart with sighing on thy bosom.Osmin.Away—away— dalliance without desire,Is lifeless sport—besides, it might encreaseThy hapless flame; and I in generous pity,Would quickly cure thy simple sex's folly.Retire—I am used to dictate—not to argue.Fatima.Since you pronounce it, I will go for ever,A banished wretch, exiled of joy or hope.But dread the anguish thou hast made me feel,May be repaid thee in the same degree:Love is a vengeful power, and will, I hope,Resent his votary's cause: some beauteous maidShall yet avenge my wrongs, and make thee knowWorse pangs than I do now—if possible.Osmin.Thy vain predictions, like phantastic dreams,Vanish in empty air. I dare denyThat all the charms of thy whole sex conjoined,Can raise, or pain or pleasure, in my breast—Full well I know, therefore despise ye all.Fatima.Then hear, almighty love, thy suppliant's prayer—If thou dost ever touch that stubborn heart,With bitterest venom tinge the piercing dart;Mix yellow jealousy, and fire-eyed rage,And may no healing balm his pangs assuage;Let him feel all love's anguish, all its pain,And may his fondest wishes meet disdain.exit.Enter NARDIC.Nardic.May endless days of never fading blissAwait my sovereign, may still ripening honoursBloom round his brow, and each day add new trophiesTo adorn his fame. Behold from Gaza's wallsA messenger arrived, proclaims your armsVictorious o'er the rebel slaves, who nowAll own allegiance to thy rightful sway.Osmin.'Tis well.Now let those lofty disaffected towers,That braved the heavens, and me, be razed to earth;And let all those who dared oppose my reign,Now feel my vengeance. Is the city sacked?Nardic.Yes, mighty Sultan.Osmin.Then let its name no longer be remembered.But see, O Nardic! how the short-lived joy,Inspired by this success, like the swift glareOf lightning, is extinguished. DiscontentReturns, and renders still thy prince unhappy.Nardic.Where then may we seek bliss, if he whose nodGives life or death, while numerous nations waitAttendant on his will, can yet be wretched!Whose every sense is gratified to fulness;While all of art, and all of nature joinTo soothe his wish, and court his appetite!Our bounteous Nile yields all that can indulgeThe smell or taste, of fruits and flowers luxuriant;Our minstrels cunning in their harmony,Draw forth such dulcet sounds as might assistCreation in her work, and animateThe dust from whence we sprang. But, O! the last,The best, the highest pitch of mortal bliss,See the collected master works of nature,The lovely fair from various regions sought,Envying each other every partial smile.Osmin.Avaunt, audacious slave! darest thou presumeTo expostulate with me? When I have saidThat I am most unhappy, think'st thou then,Thy flattering tongue can gloss my wretchedness?But wherefore do I suffer thee to breathe,Thou abject thing, except to administerDelight to Osmin? Then hear my firm resolve—If in three days thou find'st not some new joy,Some untried vanity, that may awakeMy soul, and rouse it to a sense of pleasure,Thy head shall pay the forfeit—Vanish straight,Nor waste thy precious time in vain debating.exit Nardic.Osmin.I have surrounded joy's capricious maze,Yet cannot find the clue—Some demon sureWith-holds it—But I'll seek it in the pitOf Acheron, or missing, sink in the pursuit.Nor rapes, nor murders, shall obstruct my course,Pleasures, like maids, must first be won by force;Of them too, when we taste, we soon are cloyed,And only sigh for those not yet enjoyed.End of the First Act.ACT II.SCENE, NARDIC's Apartment.NARDIC Solus.Nardic.TERROR, solicitude, and wild despair,Pursue my steps! Each moment seems my last!The tyrant seeks my life, and he must have it—Where can I turn to find new joys for one,Who has in vain exhausted nature's treasure,And plenteous as she is, hath made her bankrupt?Were he indeed a king, I might supplyNew objects daily to relieve his languor,And yield him transports beyond mortal sense.To feed the poor, to comfort the distressed,To usher bashful genius into life,Become a parent to the orphan's tear,"And cause the widow's heart to sing for joy,"Exalt a monarch to an angel's rank:But virtue ne'er hath warmed his earth-born soul,'Tis a sixth sense to Osmin. Science fairTo him hath spread her lettered page, in vain—His mind ne'er reached to contemplation's height,Nor felt the rapture of a moral sense:His pulse, his nerves form all his notices;His heart, his soul are aliens to his joys.I have sent proclamation forth, that he,Who in two days produce the fairest virginTo fill the Sultan's arms, shall in degree,Stand next to Nardic, be the third withinThis spacious realm. No claimant yet appears.Enter an Attendant, and CALED.Attendant.This stranger, mighty lord, earnest desiresTo come into thy presence. I have nowFulfilled thy wish.to Caled.Nardic.'Tis well—Retire. exit Attend. What would'st thou?Caled.Let Nardic's smiles from out the dust raise upThe lowest slave that mingles with his fellows.Here may my faithful service be accepted,And Osmin's arms be blessed with sovereign beauty.Nardic.Say on, for lo! my ears are all attention.Caled.This day the merchant Nouradin preparesTo wed the fairest maid Circassia's plains,Or Georgia's vales have ever yet presentedTo the seraglio's of the South or East.The fabled Venus fails of her description,And those angelic nymphs which by our prophetAre promised to the happy saints above,But equal her perfection. Never sure,For vulgar use were charms like her's ordained—Our Caliph only may deserve such bliss.Nardic.If that thy tongue, unused to flattering speech,Hath but reported truly, quick expectThe high reward proclaimed—Nay more, endowedWith all the active friendship of my life.Haste then, and bring this most transcendent fair,To bless my longing sight.Caled.My gracious lord,Without thy aid our purposed wish were vain.Lo! Caled is the slave of Nouradin;And shall he dare to ravish from his armsThe bride of his affections? Thou must lendThe Sultan's power, which only can accomplishHis happiness and ours: with that invested,Instant I'll force her to your raptured gaze,And prove that I want art to paint her charms.Nardic.The royal mandate quick shall be prepared,And if our holy prophet aids my prayer,She'll answer to thy boast. Come in with me.exeunt.SCENE, A Garden.NOURADIN and AMANA seated in a Bower.Nouradin.My beauteous bride, with pleasure I surveyThese dazzling gems diminished in their lustreBy thy bright eyes, like stars before the sun.But O! that glorious planet moves but slowly,Stopping perhaps his course to gaze on thee.Were Thetis such a bride as my Amana,His chariot would outspeed the wind, and yet,Not equal my impatience for the night.Amana.All that I hear, all that I see, is new;Yet not the pride of sudden elevationSwells my full heart, but gratitude to thee.These splendid ornaments, and this gay scene,Attract my wonder, but inspire not joy:'Tis he, the fond dispenser of them all,'Tis Nouradin alone that gives them value,And makes them pleasing to Amana's eyes.Nouradin.O! were the flaming mines where diamonds grow,With all of wealth and grandeur, in my power,How poorly should I estimate the gift,Compared to that which I receive from thee!Amana.Too highly dost thou rate so slight a prize,For poor Amana's heart is all her treasure,There humblest duty, joined with tenderest love,And grateful sentiment, shall ever dwell,For thee, my lord, my lover, husband, friend.Nouradin.Transporting charmer, generous to excess!But words are feeble to express my sense.Here then I make a solemn vow, that tho'kneeling.Our law admits plurality of wives,Thy Nouradin's sincere and faithful heartShall never wander from Amana's charms,Nor feel the power of beauty but from her,The pride, the pleasure of his future life,His whole of bliss below.

Why dost tremble so?Arouse, and be a man—I did not strike thee—Thou first bereaved me of that precious beauty—I but repay thee justice for thy wrongs.Nouradin.Ten thousand daggers stick within my heart—Monster, Barbarian, Oh!drops the paper, and Caled takes it up.Amana.Alas! he faints,Quick let me fly to aid him.runs to him.Caled.Lovely maid,Thy tender cares must henceforth be bestowedOn one more worthy of thy charms.

He falls.Abdallah.Curst be this clime, and doubly cursed its Prophet!For whose false faith I left the only true;At once abandoned heaven, and my country,Renounced both worlds for my Amestris' charms.O liberty! thou first, best gift, to manBestowed in Paradise—Nature's creationSubject to him, himself without controul,Except to heaven alone. Thus, thus derived,We claim it as our birth-right. Yet, O shame!Whole nations have resigned this right divine,From heaven revolting, yet submit to man.Albion alone preserves the blest Palladium,Where every power of doing good is free,And peasants may defend their rights from kings.A second Eden in religion also,In faith and practice purest among men.Yet I a renegade to each advantage,Tho' born a Briton, bred a Christian too,My creed, my country, for a woman's loveDid forfeit. True indeed, my paradiseI have enjoyed below—But vengeance sureTho' slow, hath now o'erta'en, and my AmanaIs marked a victim for her father's crime.Yet still, just heaven! If sin may be attonedkneels.By deep contrition, weigh my penitence,Nor shed the parent's guilt upon the child.Oh! rather let me live while nature's powersAdmit existence, in that life be cursedWith pain, with penury, with every illTo vex the mind, or torture human sense:Extend those evils to my latest gasp,And purge my apostasy with wounds and death!Nouradin.Why did I part with her! Why not sustainstarting up.The Sultan's cruelty, and Caled's vengeance!Oh! had they hewed me piece-meal, what could theyHave done, but kill'd me! And I now must sufferA thousand, thousand deaths! But fear for herUnmanned my nature quite—For in the strife,They might have injured her. There, there I died—Torn from my bleeding heart where is she now?Perhaps encircled in the Caliph's arms!Abdallah.Stay that ungenerous thought—tho' born a slave,My daughter ever hath been bred a Briton;Nor will she condescend to live on termsWhich her chaste soul abhors—From earliest youth,She has been taught to know that life is dowerless.Without virtue: stript of that rich portion,One lot alone remains—to die with honour.Therefore believe Amana still a virgin,Or no more—Nouradin.Why dost thou seek to aggravate my sorrows?I hoped Amana's heart might be at peace,That wealth, that grandeur might have bought her smiles,And left me only, wretched—Oh! 'tis false!Vile treason against love! That heavenly maid,Within this hour, declared she only livedFor Nouradin—Then let me instant fly,To save her from pollution: this good swordLodge deep in Osmin's breast—or in my own.Abdallah.My son, attend. A thought has quick occurred,Which may perhaps, redeem us from despair.The captain of the guards, his name is Hamet,Was once a well tried friend of mine: honest,Sincere and brave; strict bound in gratitude,For services, no matter now to tell.And if the modes of court have not erasedAll generous feelings from his aged breast,He will both pity, and assist our purpose.Should he but lend his aid, I yet have hope,Of rescuing Amana from perdition.But, oh! he never felt a father's anguish,Nor did his heart e'er bleed as mine does now!Nouradin.O! lose not time in fruitless doubts or fears.But fly this moment, and strong urge your suit;Use every argument that thought can frame,To bind him to our friendship: if my wealthCan buy his service, let him take it all,And pay me with one sight of my Amana.Abdallah.Thou need'st not seek to press a father's hasteTo save an only child; for tho' no rapturesNow fire my blood like yours, more generous passions,Rage 'gainst oppression, with parental fondness,Have made my heart as brave as his who daresThe cannon's roar in battle. But my son,Know that the adventure is most hazardous;Therefore with caution let us now proceed,Entreating heaven to bless the pious deed—And if we fail, I am prepared to bleed.End of the Second Act.ACT III.SCENE, NARDIC's Apartment.Enter NARDIC.Nardic.WHAT strong impatience agitates my mind!Would Caled were arrived. I long, yet dreadTo view this promised maid, upon whose charmsDepends my life or death. Oh! the mean slaveryOf proud dependence!

'tis thou,And thou alone, I fear, can'st give it rest.Now, hated Osmin, I defy thy vice,In spite of thee I shall escape dishonour.Wafted on air my unstained soul shall fly,And seek its native mansion in the sky;A bower of bliss for Nouradin prepare,And deck it with the choicest garlands there;Await his coming for a little space,Then live for ever in his chaste embrace.End of the Third Act.ACT IV.SCENE, A Gothic building, representing the palace of Sakara.Enter OSMIN and NARDIC.Osmin.HOW poor is greatness, and how weak is power!When a fond girl shall dare resist my will,And yield that love which I in vain sollicit,To a plebeian, to an abject slave,Low as the groveling worm on which I tread,Compared to Osmin's wealth, his rank, his birth.My word may render that mean wretch unhappy,But cannot make me blest—Even in my armsThe adverse fair will sigh for Nouradin,And curse the tyrant for the unwilling joy.Nardic.And what avail her curses, while her charmsShall gratify my sovereign's fond desire,And feast his every sense?Osmin.Away—away—I am surfeited of sense, want higher gust,Which love reciprocal alone can yield.Oh! must I never taste the fond embraceOf mutual love? The ardour ne'er beholdOf unfeigned passion, modesty alone,That brightest ornament of female beauty,Restraining its excess? Must I ne'er seeThe half denying, half consenting glanceSteal from Amana's eye? I may possess,But not enjoy her charms—Dull feast!To gorge a clove-foot satyr's appetite!O! that I could transform my outward semblance,And take the shape and garb of Nouradin!Then might I feel the true extatic joyOf being pressed with transport to the heartOf this too lovely, but capricious fair.The very thought inspires an half enjoyment.Nardic.Then why not practise the deceit, my liege?I have seen this Nouradin, when late he cameTo sue a licence out for Mecca's shrine,Whither his filial piety and dutyInclined him to perform a pilgrimage,In zeal and honour of his father's shade.He seemed a comely youth; in face and personResembling much my prince. The least disguise,In the dun shades of night, might gratifyMy sovereign's present wish: thy fond embraceWould fill her arms as well as Nouradin.'Twill make her happy during the delusion,And save a world of virgin coyness: then,If she be woman, she'll forgive the cheat,And bless the artifice that saved her shame.Osmin.Haste then—supply me with a merchant's garb,This night I'll play Amphytrion; absolvedBy gods who smile at the fond frauds of love.I'll enter the seraglio, steal intoThe sighing fair one's ward, disguise my voice,And whisper in her ear, "'Tis Nouradin,"Thy love, thy husband! Quick let us enjoy"Those transports which the sacred priest this morn,"Hath sanctified by Hymen's virtuous bands."Thus, thus, w'ell disappoint the tyrant's hope."O the transcending joy I then shall feel,When full possessing all she can bestow,I let her know 'tis Osmin she has blessed,And like another Jove confound her senseWith my full blaze of glory.Nardic.I am charmedAt this fair scene which opens to thy view,Such happy thefts exceed those dull enjoymentsWhich willing beauty yields. This key conveysMy royal master thro' the palace gates,Unseen by all his guards. Within an hour,I will provide a dress to suit the intent,Exact the same that bridegrooms wear, for suchWe must suppose was Nouradin's this morn,When habited in form to espouse the fair.And may success attend my sovereign's will,Equal to his and Nardic's mutual wish.exit.Osmin.Cold and inanimate thou talk'st of wishes,Who neither know'st the pride of king's disdained,Nor the indignance of a thwarted passion—O! could I, like another Phaeton,But guide the Sun's bright chariot, for a day,I'd plunge the world in deep and sudden darkness,Nor ask for light but from Amana's eyes.Like him too, once to obtain my soul's ambition,I'd hazard mine, and this whole globe's existence;For I in truth, could never yet believeOur lying Imans, or their flattering prophet:All that I know of bliss, I will enjoy,And leave the rest to chance, or destiny.exit.SCENE, NOURADIN's House.Enter NOURADIN in the Sultan's Robes, with HAMET and ABDALLAH.Hamet.My friends, I have risqued my life to aid your cause,And much I fear, but more I hope the event;These robes of royalty sit easy on thee,And as thou bearest a likeness to the Sultan,The guards will ne'er suspect the masquerade—But should the least suspicion chance to ariseIn any of the watch, deep plunge this daggerIn his heart, and speed thy course in silence.Nouradin.If there be such a deity as love,He will protect and guide me to Amana;For sure a fonder votary ne'er bowedBefore his altar in the Cyprian isle.Night too will be my friend; accustomed stillTo smile on lovers, she will not refuseHer aid to Nouradin.

I shall yetRetrieve the angelic maid from soul offence,And make her future life one scene of bliss.Abdallah.I would not wish to damp thy virtuous hope,But much I dread there is an heavy cloudHangs o'er our heads, to shower down evils on us.My cursed apostasy hath brought this ruinOn my ill-fated house, and my Amana,With you my son, tho' innocent, may sufferFor my impiety—So heaven decrees!Nouradin.What means Abdallah?Abdallah.In the distracted moment when my childWas deemed a sacrifice to brutal lust,And torn from thy despairing arms, and mine,I told thee of my country and religion;And oh! I told thee—Nouradin.I do remember something like a dream;While on the ground in agony I lay,You talked methought, in wild phantastic vision,Of lands of freedom, of a purer faith,And judgments visited for sins derived.Abdallah.To thee, my son, I might appear to rave,Born as thou art beneath a tyrant's yoke,And early taught to bend thy passive neckTo arbitrary sway. The mountain goddessHath never deigned to mark her footsteps here;Nor yet hath heaven its saving grace extendedTo lands of despotism, and gross imposture.But what I tremble for is, lest the charmsOf my Amestris, opening in their primeIn my Amana, may perhaps induceThe curse of disobedience to our law.Hamet.Let not thy timorous faith forebode such ills,Nor sink the spirit of our bold emprize.For thee or me, the muddy dregs of life,Are scarcely worth the draught. A nauseous potion!Therefore, without repining at the past,With calmness let us wait the pregnant future,And whether death or freedom be our lot,Let us receive the alternative like men.Abdallah.My friends, I fear not for myself, my lifeHath filled its years; and like a full fed guest,I'd gladly quit the banquet, and dependOn penitence sincere for future bliss.But oh! I dread lest those, much dearer to me,Than all the joys of earth combined, may starve,Like dowerless children of a spendthrift father,For my extravagance and luxury.Nouradin.Forbear these sad reflections—If high heaven,Whose justice with the tenderest mercy tempered,Presides o'er all its works, if it regardThe ways of man, its justice will pronounceAmana mine, and in its goodness willRestore her to my fond and faithful arms.Hamet.Prophetic be thy hope—This silver key,The last remaining badge of Hamet's greatness,None but the mighty Nardic hath another,And he most luckily attends the Sultan,Will open every gate within the palace.Beneath the garden wall we'll wait for thee—If thou escapest we shall be free, if not,This dagger shall release my bonds—Farewel.exit.Nouradin.The servent blessings of a grateful heart,Raised from the depth of sorrow into joy,Dwell ever round thee, and protect thy age.looking after him.But why that heavy gloom upon thy brow,Ill-boding to our hopes, as low'ring cloudsIn days of harvest, to the rural swain?to Abdallah.Abdallah.From threescore years of tedious disappointment,I have been taught that hope is the true curseOf Tantalus; and when the flattering draughtSeems just to touch our lips, some sullen spriteDashes the stream aside, and makes us feelOur griefs increased, by bordering on joy.Therefore I bid thy inexperience fear.Nouradin.Thy philosophic lore I'll strive to learn,When my tumultuous passions are at peace;Then only can it rule the human heart:The rudder's useless in a storm, must yieldTo raging billows, and resistless winds,Whilst the scared pilot stands in mute despair.But to our holy prophet here I kneel,To bless my little bark with prosperous gales—Let but Amana be the precious freight,No other treasure shall I wish on board,Or care what course we steer—Possessed of her,All climes, all nations are the same to me.Where-e'er she smiles a paradise will bloom,And every withered herb breathe rich perfume;Fruits will spontaneous grow beneath her eyes,And flowers to deck her bed will gladly rise.exeunt.SCENE, the Garden of the Seraglio.Enter AMANA and FATIMA.Amana.My spirits are attuned to peace and harmony,And now with tenderest pity I bemoanThy ill-placed love—Surely I think there isA curse attends that passion in our sex,And she alone is blest whose equal pulseBeats undisturbed, in senseless apathy.Fatima.O! say not so—It is the balm of life,And even its pains delightful—What must then,Its pleasures be!

I fear,I ne'er again shall know.Amana.Do not despair—When the first tumults of the Caliph's rage,For my escape, are past, then may'st thou hope.By arts of soothing tenderness, once moreTo steal into his heart, and win his love.By soft indulgence to his present passion,Thou may'st revive the former in his breast,And thus regain the empire thou hast lost.She who would please proud man, must not disdainThe lowest methods to attain her purpose:Humility's the garb in which their sexThe most delight to see us dressed—By this,Their vain superiority is shewn,And our dependent state upon their wills.Fatima.Thy calm expressions raise my utmost wonder!Thou can'st not surely, mean to die e'er long,Yet talk with such reflection and composure!Amana.My soul is fixed, and therefore am I calm.Did hope or fear perplex this constant breast,The strong emotions could not be concealed.What can I hope, from lust and tyranny?Or what have I to fear, who in that hourWhen I was forced from my fond husband's arms,Lost the last glimpse of happiness below!For thee alone, my generous Nouradin,And my unhappy father, do I feel.O! Fatima, this thought hath roused sensations,Which I could wish had slept—I am, alas!I feel it now, a weak, a very woman!Fatima.Unhappy fair! thou speak'st too modestly—No Greek or Roman ever yet recorded,Hath shewn less fear, or more contempt of death.If in the hour of trial, thy firm soulSupport thee thus, thou art a prodigy!Amana.It will not then forsake me. I am armedWith innocence; and none but guilty soulsShould fear, or hesitate at death's approach.My father will rejoice at my escape;And even thy grief, my faithful Nouradin,Will soften into tenderness and peace,By knowing I am happy—My loved shadeThou wilt invoke, thy guardian seraph then!Whilst I with joy still hovering o'er thy head,Shall guide thy footsteps in the paths of bliss.Fatima.Amazing fortitude! Sure angels prompt,And will reward thy virtue. But behold,The setting sun hath warned us to retire—Soft rest, and pleasing visions bless thy slumbers.Amana.Adieu, my friend, may every happinessThou prayest for me, await thee in return;May Osmin, since it is thy wish, restoreThat aliened heart which thou hast bought so dear.exit Fatima.My senses are oppressed—Within this bowerI will indulge their bent—Spirits benign!Who rule o'er dusk and dawn, watch and protect meFrom all the dangers of the sullen night—And O! if virgin thoughts as pure as snow,May hope for favour from ye, send a dreamOf Nouradin, my lost, my hapless lord!Let him be present to my sleeping eyes,Whom waking I shall never more behold,Or in these faithful arms again enfold;In gentlest whispers let him breathe his love,Then sighing leave me like the widowed dove.End of the Fourth Act.ACT V.SCENE before the Palace.Enter the SULTAN disguised.Osmin.I Have safely passed thro' all the several gates,And windings of these spacious courts, and trodIn paths I never traced before—This doorLeads into the serrail, and brings me nearThe summit of my joy—Why do I notAnticipate my bliss, feel all o'er rapture?No—I despise myself for such mean arts,To put on this disguise, and counterfeitA vassal's semblance thus, to gain—a Woman!Curse on the vulgar passion that enslaves us,Which ever is at war with reason's laws,And so fortuitous, we scarcely findTwo hearts united in one mutual flame,While adverse loves still jostle one another.Oh!

'Tis here—going to the side of the stage.I cannot calm my spirits—My full heartBeats at my breast, as if to force a passageTo my beloved, my betrothed Amana—An universal tremor shakes my frame!Sure 'tis the approaching joy of seeing her,That makes this tumult here. I must, I willIndulge y flattered soul in the fond triumphOf seeing her disdainful hate of Osmin,Quick change to tenderest love for Nouradin.Would this important hour were past—I will retire, and wait the wished event.enters the pavilion.SCENE draws, and discovers Amana in a Bower, rising from a Couch. The Attendant waiting.Amana.Why did you wake me from the sweetest sleepI ever yet enjoyed? My NouradinSoft called Amana, bid me rise and walk;Straight I obeyed, and on he led my stepsTo the Elysian fields; or if there beA place more beautiful, 'twas there—While heWith converse fond, but chaste, engaged my ear,And sighed out vows of never ceasing love.He promised too, that we should part no more,But smile at tyranny, and death defie.Oh! 'twas a dear delusion!Attendant.'Twas no more—The Sultan has this moment summoned youTo attend his pleasure in the close pavilion;Else I had not disturbed your happy slumber.Amana.The Sultan, said you? What! is he returned!Did he not promise me a poor two days,And is this pittance now curtailed to half?But what's a day, a week, a year, to me,Whose fate's already fixed, and soul resolved!Then why should I resent this breach of faith,Or start at hastening from the griefs I feel,And speeding to the land of peace and rest?Retire a while, I shall obey the Sultan.Attendant retires to the back of the scene.Now, now, Amana, summon all thy courage—What means this chilling damp that clings around me!Why do I tremble thus! my tottering limbsWhy should they now refuse their wonted aid!A little longer, and I shall not want it;But pale and cold stretched on my parent earth,No longer be a burthen to myself.Can love of life have power o'er the unhappy!Or shall a wretch who languishes in prison,Refuse to be set free? The instinctive voicePerhaps of nature, pleads too strongly here,And silences the stiller pleas of virtue.But cannot love inspire my timid sex?Shall I be led a willing sacrificeTo gratify a mean and gross desire!O never! Death has lost its terrors now.This cordial draught shall lead me to his arms,To peace and Nouradin— drinks. 'Tis done, and now,Fear, hope, and every passion of the soul,Are all extinct, but love—That still remains,And in my latest moments will prevailIn prayers and blessings on my Nouradin.What strengthening power hath braced my sinews thus?'Tis love, 'tis hope, 'tis immortality!Lavinia come—Attend me to the Sultan.exeunt.SCENE, The Pavilion. The Stage darkened.NOURADIN alone.Enter AMANA, and Attendant, the latter retires.Nouradin.Approach, my fair, nor longer now delayThy suppliant monarch's bliss, whose fond impatienceHath urged him to infringe his royal word,And make a sacrifice to love, transcending farWhat he requests from thee. Reduce him notTo win by force, what he would owe to favour—Believe me the rich bounties of thy love,Shall not be spent on my sole luxury,But treasured in my heart, to be repaidWith grateful use, to purchase joys for thee.Amana.Banish those vicious hopes, and know that INor dread thy power, nor supplicate thy pity.Thou see'st no more the weeping, trembling maid,Who late implored thy grace—But one who comesTo dare thy rage, and prove its impotence.Nouradin.Whence comes this boast? What means the frantic fair!Amana.She means to pour out her whole soul before thee,Its love, its hate, without disguise or fear;To curse thee tyrant from her wounded heart,And breathe forth fervent wishes for thy rival.May every joy of which thou hast deprived him,Be doubled tenfold by all gracious heaven;May long and happy days attend him here,And may we meet again in that blest place,Where tyrants ne'er can come, to part us more.Nouradin.Thy prayers are prophesies, my virtuous bride!Behold thy fondest wishes are fulfilled,And underneath this hated garb thou see'stThe happy Nouradin! O! let me pressThy constant heart close to his faithful breast.Amana.Oh!shrieks, and faints.Nouradin.She faints! the strong surprize hath overpoweredHer delicate and agitated frame—Awake, my love—My soul's immortal joyRevive, and bless me with a look, a word!Amana.Oh Nouradin! fly, fly this hated place—Nouradin.Come let me bear thee in these longing arms,Convey thee quick from out these cursed walls,And give thee back to love and liberty.Amana.Alas! my bounds are set! I ne'er shall quitThis fatal spot, 'till soul and body part.Nouradin.Dost thou indeed refuse to go with me!Has bondage then such charms, or has thy tongueBelied thy heart in feigning generous love,To enhance thy sacrifice to princely grandeur?Amana.O! cease to wound me by unkind suspicion!My heart is wholly thine—The last sad dropsIt e'er shall weep, will be fond tears for thee.Nouradin.Why then, thou angel maid, wilt thou provokeOur adverse fate, by this ill-timed delay?Amana.Alas! I fear to tell what must be known,For now ten thousand fires rage in my bosom,Oh Nouradin!Nouradin.I am on the rack! what mean these strong convulsions!Speak quickly, my heart's love—I am all distraction.Amana.That pang is past; and if my strength will hold,I'll tell thee the sad tale of woe.Nouradin.O stay!Whilst thou hast ease let me convey thee hence.Amana.Alas, my love! it is impossible.Death riots in my veins.Nouradin.Death! Said you death!Amana.Too sure he has possession of my heart,Thy only rival there! O Nouradin!He grasps me hard, wilt thou not struggle with him!Nouradin.I would contend with the united world,To save my more than life. But say, O! say,How camest thou thus! I press, yet dread to know.Amana.When torn from thee, and my unhappy father,And led a captive to the foul serrail,I firm resolved to die e'er flames impureShould blast this shrine, hallowed to love, and thee.A rival sultaness approved my vow,And whether moved by jealousy or pity,Supplied the deadly draught which late I drank,When summoned to attend the tyrant's will,In this lewd scene of infamy and vice.Now, now, I feel its baneful influenceToo strong for mortal powers—Nouradin.O holy prophet!Exchange my life for her's!Amana.O Nouradin!Forgive this fatal rashness—Had I staidA few short moments, we had now been blest;But wresting from the hand of providenceThe means of my escape, we both are wretched.But love and virtue called, and here resigned,I fall a sacrifice to heaven, and thee—Oh!dies.Nouradin.Speak on, tho' every word thy lips may utter,Be daggers here—Yet O! Speak on, and live!And art thou silent then! Shall I ne'er hearThy tender, tuneful voice once more! Nay then,No other mournful tale shall ever vexMy wounded ear, or grieve my tortured breast.Thus, from all future anguish am I free!My life, my soul shall follow my Amana.stabs himself, and dies.Enter NARDIC, and FATIMA, with Lights.HAMET and ABDALLAH, guarded.Nardic.The Sultan's slain—Secure those hoary traitors—The rack shall force them to reveal their crimes—What's here!
