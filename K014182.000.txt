A SUPPLEMENT TO THE TOUR THROUGH GREAT-BRITAIN.(PRICE TWO SHILLINGS.)Entered at Stationers-Hall.A SUPPLEMENT TO THE TOUR THROUGH GREAT-BRITAIN, CONTAINING A CATALOGUE OF THE ANTIQUITIES, HOUSES, PARKS, PLANTATIONS, SCENES, AND SITUATIONS, IN ENGLAND AND WALES, ARRANGED According to the Alphabetical Order of the several Counties;BY THE LATE MR. GRAY, Author of the ELEGY written in a Country Church-Yard, &c.To which are now added, by another Hand, Several Additions; also Blank Spaces at the End, to enable every Traveller or Reader to make his own Remarks or Corrections.LONDON: PRINTED FOR G. KEARSLEY, AT JOHNSON'S HEAD NO. 46, FLEET-STREET, 1787.ADVERTISEMENT.THIS Catalogue was originally written on the blank pages of Kitchen's English Atlas, by Mr. GRAY. His own extensive researches into the topography of this island furnished him with many of the particulars; the Summer tours which he made supplied him with more; and to these he was frequently adding, from the information of such persons on whose taste and judgement he could best depend.A few copies were first printed, and interleaved, with a view that those, to whom they were presented, might at their leisure, make such short remarks as their own personal knowledge of the several counties enables them to do; and in these to add or expunge what they may think proper. Because, as, on the one hand, it is possible some places worthy of note may be omitted, so, on the other, some may be mentioned which are hardly deserving of the traveller's attention. The excellent

person before-mentioned, who made the Catalogue, was apprehensive of this; and was therefore far from thinking his manuscript perfect. Yet, as many of his friends had transcribed it in his life-time, and many more have requested copies since his decease, it was thought best to print it in this pocket form; not only for their present gratification, but as the most likely means of rendering this little work complete, and of fitting it hereafter for the eye of the public.The present prevailing passion for viewing and examining the beautiful scenes which abound in our native country, precludes every necessity for an apology for the publication now offered to the World, and the name of the Compiler will secure to it a favourable reception. What Mr. GRAY thought important enough to engage his attention, those for whose use it is intended will not receive with neglect. Scenes, Situations, Seats, and Antiquities, selected as worthy of notice by the elegant Author of the Church-Yard

Elegy, will be visited with a degree of respect unfelt before. To his taste no person will venture to dissent, and to his judgement few but will readily subscribe.As the present Catalogue was compiled several years since, some alterations, by change of property or by deaths, may have happened in the names of the owners of particular seats—these however can be but few, and, it is presumed, of no material consequence; but as the Publisher wishes to be accurate, he will very thankfully receive any corrections which may render the Work more perfect, and by that means more useful.The copies of the former Edition where interleaved, in this the blank leaves are placed at the end, upon a more convenient plan. See page. 63, &c.(*) This Mark placed before any place, denotes that it is more particularly worthy of Notice.Just published, Price Four Shillings, sewed, A NEW EDITION, CORRECTED.LOVE AND MADNESS: IN A SERIES OF LETTERS, ONE OF WHICH CONTAINS THE ORIGINAL ACCOUNT OF CHATTERTON.GOVERNOR.—"Who did the bloody deed?"OROONOKO.—"The deed was mine."Bloody I know it is; and I expect"Your laws should tell me so.
