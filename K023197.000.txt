To the Ingenious Mr. MOORE, Author of the Celebrated WORM-POWDER.By Mr. POPE.HOW much, Egregious MOORE, are weDeceiv'd by Shews, and Forms?Whate'er we think, whate'er we see,All Human Race are Worms.Man, is a very Worm by Birth,Proud Reptile, vile and vain,A-while he crawls upon the Earth,Then shrinks to Earth again.That Woman is a Worm we find,E'er since our Gran'am's Evil:She first convers'd with her own kind,That Ancient Worm, the Devil.But whether Man, or He, God knows,Foecundified her Belly,With that pure Stuff from whence we rose,The Genial Vermicelli.The Learn'd themselves, we Book-Worms name;The Blockhead, is a Slow-Worm;The Nymph, whose Tail is all on Flame,Is aptly term'd a Glow-Worm.The Fops are painted Butter-Flies,That flutter for a Day;First from a Worm they took their Rise,Then in a Worm decay.The Flatterer an Ear-wig grows.Some Worms suit all Conditions;Misers are Muck-Worms, Silk-Worms Beaus,And Death-Watches Physicians.That Statesmen have a Worm is seenBy all their winding Play:Their Conscience is a Worm within,That gnaws them Night and Day.Ah! MOORE! thy Skill were well Employ'd,And greater Gain wou'd rise,If thou could'st make the Courtier voidThe Worm that never Dies.O Learned Friend of Abchurch-Lane,Who sett'st our Entrails free,Vain is thy Art, thy Powder Vain,Since Worms shall Eat ev'n Thee.Thou only can'st our Fates adjourn,Some few short Years, no more;Ev'n BUTTON's Wits to Worms shall turn,Who Maggots were before.FINIS.LONDON: Printed for E.
