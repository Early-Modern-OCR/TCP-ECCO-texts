A SHORT TREATISE ON THE ENGLISH TONGUE.A SHORT TREATISE ON THE ENGLISH TONGUE.Being an Attempt to render the Reading and Pronunciation OF THE SAME More EASY to FOREIGNERS.LONDON: Printed for R. HORSFIELD in Ludgate Street, and I. ALLIX in Glanville Street, Rathbone Place.MDCCLXVII.INTRODUCTION.IT is generally allowed, that the most easy method of attaining any living language is to associate and converse with those who speak it. Nevertheless, when a foreigner has by this means so far acquired the English tongue, that he shall be able to speak it, and under∣stand it when spoken, tolerably well, he will yet find himself greatly at a loss, when he at∣tempts to read: because the manner of ex∣pressing sounds by letters in his own language is so very different from ours, that many English words, which he is well acquainted with by ear, will not appear to him to be the same when he sees them in writing.—For not only various sounds are expressed in the English language by the same vowels; but also, in many particular words, a kind of ar∣bitrary

pronunciation is used, which cannot easily be reduced to rule, and is therefore most commonly taught merely by ear, or imi∣tation.This latter difficulty, I am afraid, cannot be removed; but, I think, it may be relieved in some degree, by separating all such words from those which are capable of being taught by rule. This I have attempted, and have accordingly collected all, or the greatest part of such kind of words, under their proper heads, as exceptions to the several rules given in the following pages, together with a short explanation of their sound.—By this means a learner may have his task before him, and may easily refer to any particular word, as he shall have occasion; which will greatly relieve his memory.I have not taken notice of all the deriva∣tives and compounds which properly belong to the several exceptions, but for the most part of primitive words only, for the sake of brevity; which I hope will be thought suffi∣cient,

the others being naturally comprehend∣ed therein. Many words indeed are varied according to the different position of the ac∣cent, which not only shortens the articula∣tion of the succeeding syllables, but in some words causes them to be so indistinctly pro∣nounced, that it is sometimes difficult to de∣termine what vowels are sounded therein: yet if the learner is but careful to give the ac∣cented syllable its proper pronunciation ac∣cording to the following rules, he will natu∣rally fall into the customary utterance of the other syllables, which, as they are pronounced quick, need not be studied so particularly.The rules treat only of the general power of the vowels and diphthongs, because in these consist the most material differences between the English pronunciation and that of foreign∣ers; but I have added thereto, by way of ap∣pendix, a short treatise (drawn up and com∣municated by a friend) for the explanation of such particularities also of the other letters as are peculiar to the English tongue.All which together (I flatter myself) will be sufficient to enable a foreigner to read and pronounce any English words with ease and certainty, when the syllables of the same are properly divided according to the learned Dr. Lowth's excellent rule for spelling, given in the 7th page of his English grammar, viz. The best and only sure rule for dividing the syllables in spelling, is to divide them as they are naturally divided in a right pronunciation; without regard to the deri∣vation of words, or the possible combina∣tion of consonants at the beginning of a syllable.Mr. John Gignoux likewise particularly re∣commends and explains this method, in the preface to his spelling-book, intituled, The Child's best Instructor in Spelling and Read∣ing. A title which it seems well to de∣serve, on account of the division of the seve∣ral syllables according to the manner above-mentioned, by which it is rendered (in my opinion at least) the most useful book of the sort that has hitherto been published.I must however observe, that the author, in his Table of Words written very different from their Pronunciation, at page 82, has too much followed the common London pro∣nunciation; which, tho' perhaps in general the best, yet has some very exceptionable particu∣larities. Among which are, Potticary for Apo∣thecary, Athist for Atheist, Awkurd for Auk∣ward, Riccolas for Auricolas, Belcony for Balcony, Carrin for Carrion, Sirket for Cir∣cuit, Crowner for Coroner, Gorjus for Gor∣geous, Hankerchur for Handkerchief, I'urn for Iron, Ilan for Island, Spanel for Spaniel, Stum∣much for Stomach, Sound for Swoon, Thusty for Thirsty, Vawt for Vault, Venzun for Veni∣son, Verdit for Verdict, &c.Also in page 57 he signifies that the termi∣nations -tial, -cial, -cian, -tious, -cious, -tient, and cient, make each of them but one sound or syllable. But however common such pro∣nunciation may be, it ought not by any means to be taught, or laid down as a rule; because the English language loses much of its ele∣gance,

when it is expressed in so careless a manner, that any of the above-mentioned ter∣minations shall seem but one syllable.The i in all these terminations has the sound of the English e; and though it is pronounced quick, yet it ought to be distinctly expressed, as in Parti-al, Soci-al, Greci-an, Capti-ous, Graci-ous, Quoti-ent, Anci-ent, &c. There fore I hope that the author, in his next edi∣tion of that useful book, will make some al∣teration in his explanation of these particu∣lars.Others, besides Mr. Gignoux, have been misled by the indistinct manner in which some particular syllables are sometimes uttered even by good speakers. Mr. James Buchanan in particular has given himself much unneces∣sary trouble, and has carried his refinements a great deal too far concerning syllables of this kind, which, in quick pronunciation, have seemed to him to partake of an articulation different from the real spelling. This has, un∣fortunately, not only added great difficulty to

his An Essay towards establishing a Standard for an ele∣gant and uniform Pronunciation of the English Language, as practised by the most learned and polite Speakers. performance, but rendered it almost in∣capable of answering the good purposes in∣tended by it. For he has frequently substi∣tuted an imaginary articulation of one vowel for the inarticulation, or rather the short and indistinct sound, of another; not considering that the expressing of an accented syllable in many particular words does almost unavoid∣ably cause the succeeding syllable or syllables to be so indistinctly pronounced, that it is sometimes difficult to determine what vowels are sounded therein, as I have before ob∣served.But when words are so pronounced, that in∣stead of the short or indistinct sound of one vowel, a manifest articulation of another dif∣ferent vowel may be distinguished; it then be∣comes a fault in speech, which (howsoever common it may be) ought by no means to be

imitated, much less taught; because the ge∣nerality of people are naturally too liable of themselves to acquire it, without being led thereto by written instructions.The following examples taken from Mr. Buchanan's book will illustrate what has been said; viz. He has substituted -ĭl for the ter∣minations -al, -ial, and -el, as Năivĭl, Neu∣trĭl, Kŏmĭkl, Joodeĕshĭl, Spĕshĭl, Quărĭl, &c. for Naval, Neutral, Comical, Judicial, Spe∣cial, Quarrel, &c. Mr. Peyton's "New Vocabulary or Grammar of the true pronunciation of the English" is not less liable to cen∣sure, for the same words are there rendered Nai-vel, Niutrel, djŏu-dĭ-chiel, Spe-chiel, Couâr-ril, &c.-in for -an, as Heumin, Orgĭn, &c. for Human, Organ, &c. -ĭnss for -ance and -ence; and -ĭnt for -ant and -ent, as Abundinss, Rĕvĕrinss, Contentmĭnt, Com∣mandmint, &c. instead of Abundance, Re∣verence, Contentment, Commandment, &c.
-fŏol for -ful as Faithfoŏl, &c. iss for ess, as Heedlĭss, Hăppĭnĭss, and a great abundance of such other syllables, equally distant from the true pronunciation.As I have no other motive for giving my opinion so freely concerning this gentleman's performance, than the desire of removing all unnecessary difficulty from the learning of English, I hope he will excuse me; even though my remarks should not have sufficient weight to convince him.He may likewise assure himself, that, though I think an uniformity of pronunciation through∣out the British dominions is more to be wished than hoped for; yet I should have as much real satisfaction as himself in the completion of that "great moral end," which (as he sup∣poses in his preface) would be promoted thereby, viz. the removal of national preju∣dice; an effect equally to be desired by all lovers of their country, whether South or North Britons!It would be much to the advantage of all those who learn the English tongue, if the

syllables in all future editions of English dic∣tionaries were divided according to the A very useful little dictionary on this plan was printed in 1764, for J. Nourse and S. Hooper in the Strand, intituled, "the Complete English Spelling Dictionary upon an entire new Plan;" the author, Mr. J. Carter. me∣thod recommended by Dr. Lowth and Mr. Gignoux before mentioned: and likewise if the words, which are not properly English, were distinguished by an asterisk, or some other par∣ticular mark placed before them; that foreign∣ers may not conceive our language to be un∣necessarily copious and difficult.The coining of new words from other lan∣guages to express any thing, which might as concisely and elegantly be explained in proper English words, is a kind of pedantry, which all writers should endeavour to avoid: unless we be allowed to except those who treat of na∣tural philosophy, medicine, surgery, or such other subjects as are supposed to be read by none but those who are acquainted with other languages, or at least have some knowledge of

the Latin tongue. For it ought to be the study of every writer to make his meaning as plain and intelligible in the proper language in which he writes, as he possibly can. Yet so many of our most eminent writers have oc∣casionally been guilty of the fault above men∣tioned, that the ingenious Mr. Johnson has thought himself obliged to insert a great abun∣dance of such coined words into his excellent English dictionary; and the reverend Mr. Entick likewise into his very useful new pocket dictionary. But I cannot suppose that such kind of words were admitted by these gen∣tlemen as proper English words; but merely that they might explain them to English rea∣ders; who without the knowledge of other languages cannot otherwise possibly understand them: which is a sufficient proof that they are not at all intitled to the name of English words.For how should an English reader (I mean a reader merely of English) be supposed to under∣stand that Ablepsy signifies blindness? Acetosity sourness? Anhelation panting? Arcanum a

secret? Obesity fatness? Papilio a butterfly? Neoterick, modern? Paranymph a bride-man? Rugose wrinkled? Squalor nastiness? Terreous earthy? Tenebricose dark; Tripudiation dancing? Tumefy to swell? Turm a troop? and a thou∣sand other such words, which are found in both dictionaries?It is much to be wished that all such new coined words, which have only been used by a few authors, were distinguished by some mark from the common and proper English words (as I have hinted above) in all future editions of these useful dictionaries: lest so many un∣couth and pedantick expressions should be adopted into the English tongue by dictionary authority. Because when a person sees them ranged with other words in an English dic∣tionary, he may be induced to make use of them as proper English words in his writing and discourse, which would, at first, cause no small impediment to the understanding of his ordinary readers and hearers.The accents used in these dictionaries are particularly useful for keeping up an uniformity in pronunciation; and it would be well if the double accents were also added to some parti∣cular words, as in Mr. Gignoux's spelling book for the purpose mentioned in page 7 of his preface, viz. To denote, that the consonant that begins the next syllable must be also sounded at the end of the syllable where the double accent is; as a″-tóne-ment; man″-gle; in-tan″-gle; which words must be sounded as if written at-tone-ment; mang-gle; intang-gle; so in con″-quer-or; con″-cu-bine; &c.The same would also be particularly useful in words, wherein g and c are softened by the vowels e and i fol∣lowing them in the next syllable as in neg-lig″-ent; vo-rac″ity, &c.In my search for such words as are inde∣pendent of the following rules, I made use of the Rev. Mr. Entick's new spelling dictionary; and though I examined the same so carefully,

that I believe I have not made many omissions, yet the whole number of particular exceptions (exclusive of their compounds and derivatives) amount to no more than There are indeed 54 foreign words besides; (see page 15) which are not included in this number, because, as they still retain their original pronunciation (or nearly so) they cannot properly be accounted exceptions to English rules. 340—which number bears a very small proportion to the number of words in that dictionary; which I compute to be upwards of 23,000. This, I think, ought to prove that the English pronunciation is not so very irregular as it is generally thought to be; which a careful examination of the fol∣lowing pages will more particularly shew.A SHORT TREATISE ON THE ENGLISH TONGUE.THE English vowels, a, e, i, o and u, have each of them The vowels may indeed be said to have more sounds than 2, because a different pronunciation from the 2 sounds here spoken of, is given to each of the vowels in a few particular cases, which are hereafter noted; but at present I am only speaking of their general power. 2 sounds, commonly called long and short.The sounds of the three first vowels a, e, and i, when long, seem to be peculiar at present to this nation, wherefore they may properly be called the English sounds.And the short sounds of these three vowels may, for the sake of distinction, be called the foreign sounds; because they are uttered with scarcely any difference (except that a and i, are pronounced short) from the French arti∣culation of the same vowels; which shall be more fully explained by See the examples to the 2d rule. examples here∣after.I think it necessary to observe in this place that the English sound of the following vowels, diphthongs and terminations cannot easily be expressed in foreign letters, and should there∣fore be learned by ear, viz.i long There are 2 ways of sounding the long i and y (though both long) the one a little different from the other, and requiring a little more extension of the mouth, as may be seen by comparing the following words, viz. I and Aye, High and High-ho; By't (or by it) and Bite; Sigh'd and Side; Strive and Strife, &c. but this dif∣ference being so nice, is not to be attained but by much practice, neither is it very material., as in Bi-ble, Mi-tre, Nitre, Pirate, &c.o and u short, before a consonant in the same syllable as in Odd, Nod, Lord, &c. and in Mud, Strut, Stun, Urn, &c.oi and oy, which have both the same sound, as in Oil, Boil, Coil, Boy, Coy, Hoy, &c.ou and ow (not like the French ou, in the pronunciation of which the lips are almost closed, but) with an open articulation as in Pound, Our, Gown, Pow-er, &c.Also the following Terminations, viz.
-ire-tion-cious-tious
as in Dire, Fire, Salvation, Deli∣cious, Fictitious, &c.The English (or long) sound is given to the vowels a, e,Rule I. and i (and the other vowels are also sounded long) when they are alone, or when there is not a consonant following them in the same syllable (also before silent e in the end of a word; see the 3d rule)
Exam∣plesa like the French e in Bête, as in Ca-ble, Fa-ble, Sa-ble, &c.e like the French i in Mille, as in Be, He, E-vil, Be-ver, Le-gal, &c.i like the Greek At quoties litera i longa est plerumque effertur ut Graecorum . See Wallis's Grammatica Linguae An∣glicanae.
or something like the French i long before n in Divin, Prince, Enfin, &c. as in Bi-ble; Di-al; Fi-nal; Gi-ant, &c.o like the French o or au, as in Go; So; Lo-cal; Mo-ment, &c.u like ew in Few, Pew, &c. as in Du-ty, Fu-ry, Hu-man, &c.y (when a vowel) like the English i; as in the monosyllables Buy and Guy, (where∣in u is mute) Dry, Fry, My, Dye, &c. in the dissyllables, Ally′, Com-ply′, De-ny′, De-scry′, De-fy′, Es-py′, Im-ply′, Re-ly′, and Re-ply′, which are ac∣cented on the ultimate syllable; and in all words compounded with the Latin word Fio; as Dé-ify, Magnify, Spe∣cify, Rarify, &c.(Particular Exceptions concerning a, at the End of a Syllable)Except, 1st, a in Wa-ter, wherein it is commonly pro∣nounced like the French a, or English diphthong aw; in Fa-ther, and the last syllable of Pa-pa, Mam-ma, wherein it has a medium sound between aw and the English a; and in a-ny, and ma-ny, where∣in it sounds like a short e.(Particular Exceptions concerning i)2dly,i in ac-qui-esce, Bi-er, Pi-er, and Tier, wherein it sounds like the English e.(General Exceptions concerning i)3dly,i is pronounced short before another vowel in the termination of all words of more than 2 syllables, when it is not radical; as in A′mĭ-able, De-mo-nĭ-ac′k, Ca′r-rĭ-age, So′-cĭ-al, Wi′l-lĭ-am, Sty′g-ĭ-an, Da′l-lĭ-ance, Va′l-ĭ-ant, Spăn-ĭ-ard, A′-pĭ-ary, So′-cĭ-ate, In-sid-ia′tor, Al-le-vĭ a′tion, Ma′r-rĭ-ed, A-lĭ-en, Co′n-scĭ-ence, Am′-bĭ-ent,

But in the proper names Ma-r-i′a and So-ph-i′a, when given to English women, it is pronounced accord∣ing to rule. Also, in A′ffi′-ance, and the derivatives from the dissyllables ending in y, which are mentioned in the example: as Al-li′-ance, Com-pli′-ance, De-ni′-al, De-fi′-ance, and Re-li′-ance, wherein the iWhen i is substituted for y in the terminations of derivatives, it retains the sound of the y in the original word, whether long or short; therefore i in Cār-rĭ-er, Cār-rĭ-ed, and Cār-rĭes, is short; and in Al-lī-ance, De-nī-al, Dig-ni fī-ed, Im-plīes, &c. is pronounced long like the y in the primitive words before specified. re∣tains the sound of the y in the original words, and is accented accordingly.Particular Exceptions concerning o.Except, 4thly,o in Do (and its compounds) To, and Who, which is commonly pronounced like oo; though the latter (Who) is pro∣nounced

according to the rule in the nor∣thern parts of England.5thly,u, in the first syllable of Cu-cumber, which is commonly pronounced like the English ou hereafter explained.General Exception concerning y.6thly,y, at the end of all words of two or more syl∣lables (except those mentioned in the ex∣ample) is pronounced like a short i, as in Carry, Envy, Commissary, &c. the accent being laid on one of the former syllables.Of vowels in syllables ending with a con∣sonant.ule II.The vowels are pronounced short in all syl∣lables ending with a consonant (except in the particular cases hereafter noted) and the three first vowels have the foreign articulation, with∣out any other material difference, except that of being pronounced short.EXAMPLES.a has a short articulation of the English aw, or rather of the Italian a, as in Add, Bad, Lad, Mad, &c.e has exactly the sound of the Italos ego, uti nostros etiam recte eam (literam e) proferre censeo in vocibus, ascendo, ventus, &c.

Italian or French é, as in Bed, Fed, Led, Red, &c.i has a short articulation of the I vocalis, quoties brevis est, sonatur plerumque (ut apud Gallos aliosque) exili sono, Wallis, fo. 47. French i, or English e, as in Bid, Did, Hid, Kid, &c.The short sound of the two other vow∣els (viz. o and u) must be acquired by ear, as I have before observed (see exam∣ples of these vowels in p. 3. of this trea∣tĭse.)Particular Exceptions concerning a before a consonant.Except, 1st,a in A′n-gel, Bass, Ca′m-brick, Ca′m-bridge, Da′n-ger, and Ma′n-ger, is commonly sound∣ed like the French diphthong ai; in han't (for have not) Ma′s-ter, and Pla′s-ter, it

has a medium sound between aw and the English a; and in Hal-ser (wherein l is mute) False, and Palsy, it is commonly pronounced like aw.General Exceptions concerning a before a consonant.2dly,a has the sound of aw likewise before ld and lt, as in Bald, Cal-dron, Altar, &c.; in all primitive monosyllables ending in ll (except shall and Mall, which are pronounced ac∣cording to rule) as in All, Gall, Fall, &c.; and before lk (wherein l is mute) as Balk, Stalk, Walk, Talk, &c.: but before lf, lm, lve, and before nd in words derived from the Latin word Mando, it is sounded like the Italian a, only somewhat longer, as in Half, Calm, Salve, Command, Demand, &c.Particular Exceptions concerning c before a consonant.Except, 3dly,e in England, Pretty, Yes, and Yet, wherein it is pronounced like a short ĭ, and in Yel∣low like a short ă.General Exception concerning e before s.4thly,e is pronounced long before S final in these cases is always pronounced like z.s in the ulti∣mate of plural nouns, and third persons singular of verbs when preceded by c, s, z, or g, as in Fa′-ces, Ho′r-ses, As-si′-zes, Ra′-ges, &c.; but in all other terminations with silent e (except in Latin words) the es may be sounded in the same syllable, as Bride Brides, Ride Rides, Name Names, &c.Particular Exceptions concerning i before a consonant.5thly,i in Blithe, Endict, and Indict (wherein c is mute) Mild, Pint, and Wild, retains its English, or long sound; also in Child and Christ, but not in their Derivatives, Chil∣dren, Christen, and Christian.General Exceptions concerning i before a con∣sonant.6thly,i is likewise sounded long in all primitive words (and their compounds and deriva∣tives) ending in nd; as Bind, Rind, Wind, &c.; though in Wind, the substantive, and its compounds, it is sometimes pronounced short.It is also sounded long before gh, as in High, Nigh, Light, &c. in which gh is mute, having no other use than that of lengthening the i.It is long also before gn at the end of a word (and the g is mute) as in Benign, Sign, and its compounds Consign, Design, &c. and their Derivatives in -er, -ed, -edly, and -ment, but no others; for in Re-sig-na-tion, Con-sig-na-tion, Sig-nif-i-ed, &c. the i is short according to rule, and the g is pro∣nounced.General Exceptions concerning o before con∣sonants.Except, 7thly,o in all words ending in ld and lt, as Beho′ld, Bold, Cold, Bolt, Colt, &c. and all their compounds and derivatives, retains its long sound.Particular Exceptions of o before a conso∣nant.8thly,o is also pronounced long in Boll, Bolster, Comb (wherein b is mute) Control, Droll, Folk (wherein l is mute) Force, Fort, Ghost, Gross, Ho′lster, Host, Most, Only, Post, Poll, Pat-ro′ll, Port, Roll, Scroll, Sloth, Sport, and Sword (wherein w is mute) Stroll, Toll, and Troll, and in their com∣pounds, &c.

B is mute before t, or after m, in the same syllable, as Debt, Lamb, &c.2. C sounds soft, like s, when followed by e, i, or an apostrophe (denoting the absence of e) as Cedar, City, Danc′d, &c.C sounds like sh, when followed by ea, ia, ie, or io, making different syllables, as Ocean, Ancient, Precious, Social, &c. except So∣ciety.CC when followed by e or i, sounds like x, as Accept, Accident, &c.C is mute in Indict, Victuals, Scene, Scent, Science, Sciatica, Scissors, Scission, Scymiter, Scythe, and the proper names Scyros, Scylla, and Scythia.In all other cases C sounds hard like k.3. Ch, when properly English, has the same sound with the Italian c, before e or i. Examp. Child, Chain, &c.It sounds also like sh, in words derived from the French, as Chaise, Champaigne, &c. and like k in words of Greek ex∣traction, as Christ, School, Stomach, Arch∣angel, &c. pronounced Ark-angel. But if Arch comes before a consonant, ch has then its proper English sound, as in Arch∣bishop.Ch in Loch sounds like f.Ch is mute in Drachm, Schedule, and Schism.4. D is mute before ge, as in Judge, Bridge, &c. also in Soldier.5. F in Of sounds like v.6. G sounds soft like j before e, i, or an apostro∣phe, and hard (like the Greek y) in all other cases.Examp. Angel, Rage, Rag′d, Giant, Ginger, &c.Exceptions to G′s sounding soft.1. In the participles passive of words ending in g hard (and also where-ever g is dou∣bled) it continues hard, notwithstanding the vowels e or i, or an apostrophe, as in Dragg′d, Begging, Digging, &c.2. In the termination ger, where-ever it makes a distinct syllable, g sounds hard, as in An″-ger, Fin″ger, Lon″ger, Stron″ger, &c. in which kind of words it may be ob∣served that the g sounds double, so as to belong to both syllables.3. Derivatives in er, ed, or ing from primi∣tives in ng, retain the g hard, as Sing∣ing, Sing-er, from Sing; Hang-ing, Hang-er, from Hang; Winged or Wing′d from Wing, &c. In which kind of words it

may be observed, that g sounds single, and belongs to the first syllable only.4. In the following words G is hard, not∣withstanding it comes before e or i; viz. Geese, Gewgaw, Geld, Gelt, Gertrude, Get (with its compounds) Gibberish, Gibbous, Giddy, Gift, Gig, Giggle, Gild, Girl, Give, Forgive, Gilt, Gimblet, Gimp, Gird, Girt, Girdle, Begin, Gizzard, Gideon, Gibbons, Gilbert, and Gilpin.G is mute before n in the same syllable, as Gnash, Sign, Sovereign, &c. also in Phlegm, Seraglio, and Bagnio.7. Gh sounds like G hard in Ghost, and like ff in Cough, Lough, Laugh, Laughter, Rough, Slough, Tough, Trough, and Enough. In other words it is mute.8. H is mute in Hour, Honour, Honest, Heir, Herb, Humour, Hostler, Thyme, John, Tho∣mas, Thomasin, and Thames. Also in Greek words, when preceded by R, as Rheum, Rhyme, Rhetoric, Myrrh, &c. and lastly at the end of words, as ah, hah, Isaiah, Sa∣rah, &c.9. K is mute before n in the same syllable, as Knave, Know, Knight, &c.10. L is mute in Balk, Talk, Walk, Stalk, Balm, Calm, Calf, Calves, Falcon, Half, Halves, Holme (an island) and Holmes (a surname) Psalm, Qualm, Salmon, Could, Should, and Would.11. N is mute after m in the same syllable, as Hymn, Autumn, Solemn, &c.12. P is mute before s, and between m and t, as Psalm, Tempt, &c.13. Ph is always sounded like f, except in Ste∣phen, Nephew, and Phial, where it sounds like v.Ph is mute in Phthisic, and is pronounced Tizzic.14. Q is always followed by u, and, when it begins a syllable, sounds like cw, by which (as Mr. Johnson observes) our Saxon ancestors well expressed it. But in terminations from the Latin -quus, and also in words of French extraction, it sounds like k. Examp. Oblique, Antique, Quoif, Conquer, Risque, Traffique, &c. some of which words
