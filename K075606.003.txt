A SELECT COLLECTION OF MISCELLANY POEMS.THE EAGLE AND THE ROBINThe political moral of this little apologue is too evident to need any other comment, than barely mentioning that the lady was Queen Anne; desiring the reader to recollect the change which she made in her ministry in 1709, the year in which this poem was written; and referring to Dr. King's "Rufinus, or the Favourite," in the English Poets, vol. XX. . 367 N., An APOLOGUE; translated from the Original of AESOP, written Two Thousand Years since, and now rendered in familiar Verse by H. G. L. Mag.GOOD precepts and true gold are more valuable for their antiquity. And here I present my good reader with one, delivered by the first founder of mythology, Aesop himself. Maximus Planudes takes notice of it, as a very excellent part of his production; and Phaedrus, Camerarius, and others, seem to agree, that his Eagle, and five others not yet translated, are equal to

any of his that are handed down to us. Though Mr. Ogleby and Sir Roger L'Estrange had the unhappiness to be unacquainted with them, yet I had the good fortune to discover them by the removal of my old library, which has made me amends for the trouble of getting to where I now teach. They were written, or dictated at least, by Aesop, in the fifty-fourth Olympiad: and though I designed them chiefly for the use of my school (this being translated by a youth designed for a Greek professor), yet no man is so wise as not to need instruction, aye, and by the way of fable too; since the Holy Scriptures themselves, the best instructors, teach us by way of parable, symbol, image, and figure; and David was more moved with Nathan's "Thou art the man," than all the most rigid lectures in the world would have done. Whoever will be at the trouble of comparing this version with the original, let them begin at the tenth line, and they will find it metaphrastically done, verbum verbo, as the best way of justice to the author. Those that are meer adorers of  will not be angry that it is in this sort of metre, for which I gave leave, the lad having a turn to this sort of measure, which is pleasant and agreeable, though not lofty. For my own part, I concur with my master Aristotle, that  are very far from being unnecessary or unpleasant. May this be of use to thee; and it will please thine in all good wishes,HORAT. GRAM.THE EAGLE AND THE ROBIN.BY DR. KINGTo the works of this excellent Humourist, which were first collected in 1776, I prefixed some Memoirs of his Life; which have since been so elegantly epitomized, that it would be superfluous to enlarge on this article. Some extracts from his last biographer shall therefore supply the place: "William King was born in London in 1663, the son of Ezekiel King, a gentleman. He was allied to the family of Clarendon. From Westminster-school, where he was a scholar on the foundation under the care of Dr. Busby, he was at eighteen elected to Christ-church, in 1681. In 1688, he was made master of arts; and, engaging in the study of the Civil Law, became doctor in 1692, and was admitted advocate at Doctors Commons.—Though he was a regular advocate in the courts of civil and canon law, he did not love his profession, nor indeed any kind of business which interrupted his voluptuary dreams, or forced him to rouse from that indulgence in which only he could find delight. His reputation as a civilian was yet maintained by his judgements in the courts of Delegates, and raised very high by the address and knowledge which he discovered in 1700, when he defended the earl of Anglesea against his lady, afterwards dutchess of Buckinghamshire, who sued for a divorce, and obtained it. The expence of his pleasures, and neglect of business, had now lessened his revenues; and he was willing to accept of a settlement in Ireland, where, about 1702, he was made judge of the admiralty, commissioner of the prizes, keeper of the records in Birmingham's tower, and vicar-general to Dr. Marsh the primate. But it is vain to put wealth within the reach of him who will not stretch out his hand to take it. King soon found a friend, as idle and thoughtless as himself, in Upton, one of the judges, who had a pleasant house called Mountown, near Dublin, to which King frequently retired; delighting to neglect his interest, forget his cares, and desert his duty. Here he wrote "Mully of Mountown," a poem, by which, though fanciful readers in the pride of sagacity have given it a political interpretation, was meant originally no more than it expressed, as it was dictated only by the author's delight in the quiet of Mountown. In 1708, when lord Wharton was sent to govern Ireland, King returned to London, with his poverty, his idleness, and his wit. In 1711, competence, if not plenty, was again put into his power. He was, without the trouble of attendance, or the mortification of a request, made gazetteer. He was now again laced in a profitable employment, and again threw the benefit away. An Act of Insolvency made his business at that time particularly troublesome; and he would not wait till hurry should be at an end, but impatiently resigned it, and returned to his wonted indigence and amusements. One of his amusements at Lambeth, where he resided, was to mortify Dr. Tennison, the archbishop, by a publick festivity, on the surrender of Dunkirk to Hill; an event with which Tennison's political bigotry did not suffer him to be delighted. King was resolved to counteract his sullenness, and at the expence of a few barrels of ale filled the neighbourhood with honest merriment. In the autumn of 1712 his health declined; he grew weaker by degrees, and died on Christmas-day. Though his life had not been without irregularity, his principles were pure and orthodox, and his death was pious. After this relation, it will be naturally supposed that his poems were rather the amusements of idleness than efforts of study; that he endeavoured rather to divert than astonish; that his thoughts seldom aspired to sublimity; and that, if his verse was easy and his images familiar, he attained what he desired. His purpose is to be merry; though perhaps, to enjoy his mirth, it may be sometimes necessary to think well of his opinions." I need not repeat that this is quoted from Dr. Johnson.The poems which are now presented to the reader are none of them in the late collection of the English Poets. N., OF THE COMMONS. NOT PRINTED IN HIS WORKS.A LADY liv'd in former days,That well deserv'd the utmost praise;For greatness, birth, and justice fam'd,And every virtue could be nam'd;Which made her course of life so even,That she's a Saint (if dead) in Heaven.This Lady had a little seatJust like a palace, 'twas so neat,From aught (but goodness) her retreat.One morning, in her giving way,As was her custom every day,To cheer the poor, the sick, and cold,Or with apparel, food, or gold,There came a gazing stranger by,On whom, she quickly cast an eye.The man admiring, made a stand;He had a bird upon his hand:" What's that, says she, that hangs its head,Sinking and faint? 'Tis almost dead."" Madam, a Red-breast that I found,By this wet season almost drown'd."" Oh! bring him in, and keep him warm;Robins do never any harm."They soon obey'd, and chopt him meat,Gave him whatever he would eat;The Lady care herself did take,And made a nest for Robin's sake:But he perkt up into her chair,In which he plenteously did fare,Assuming quite another air.The neighbours thought, when this they spy'd,The world well mended on his side.With well-tun'd throat he whistled long,And every body lik'd his song." At last, said they, this little thingWill kill itself, so long to sing;We 'll closet him among the restOf those my Lady loves the best."They little thought, that saw him come,That Robins were so quarrelsome:The door they open'd, in he pops,And to the highest perch he hops;The party-colour'd birds he chose,The Gold-finches, and such as those;With them he'd peck, and bill, and feed,And very well (at times) agreed:Canary-birds were his delight,With them he'd tête-à-tête all night;But the brown Linnets went to pot,He kill'd them all upon the spot.The servants were employ'd each day,Instead of work, to part some fray,And wish'd the aukward fellow curstThat brought him to my Lady first.At last they all resolv'd upon 't,Some way to tell my Lady on 't.Meanwhile he 'd had a noble swing,And rul'd just like the Gallic king;Having kill'd or wounded all,Unless the Eagle in the hall;With whom he durst but only jar,He being the very soul of war,But hated him for his desert,And bore him malice at his heart.This Eagle was my Lady's pride,The guardian safety of her side:He often brought home foreign prey,Which humbly at her feet he lay.For colour, pinions, and stature,The fairest workmanship of nature;'Twould do one good to see him move,So full of grandeur, grace, and love:He was indeed a bird for Jove.He soar'd aloft in Brucum's field,And thousand Kites and Vultures kill'd;Which made him dear to all that flew,Unless to Robin and his crew.One day poor Bob, puff'd up with pride,Thinking the combat to abide,A goose-quill on for weapon ty'd,Knowing by use, that, now and then,A sword less hurt does than a pen.As for example—What at homeYou 've well contriv'd to do at Rome,A pen blows up—before you come.You are suppos'd to undermineThe foe—in some immense design.A pen can bite you with a line;There's forty ways to give a sign.Well—all on fire away he stalk'd,Till come to—where the Eagle walk'd.Bob did not shill-I shall-I go,Nor said one word of friend or foe;But flirting at him made a blow,As game-cocks with their gauntlets do.At which the Eagle gracefullyCast a disdaining, sparkling eye;As who should say—What 's this, a flie?But no revenge at all did take,He spar'd him for their Lady's sake,Who ponder'd these things in her mind,And took the conduct of the Eagle kind.Upon reflection now—to shewWhat harm the least of things may do,Mad Robin, with his cursed flirt,One of the Eagle's , amongst the Greeks, signifies "Honour as tender as the eye." KING. eyes had hurt;Inflam'd it, made it red and sore:But the affront inslam'd it more.Oh, how the family did tear!To fire the house, could scarce forbear:With scorn, not pain, the Eagle fir'd,Murmur'd disdain, and so retir'd.Robin, to offer some relief,In words like these would heal their grief:" Should th' Eagle die (which Heaven forbid!)We ought some other to provide.I do not say that any nowAre fit, but in a year or two:And should this mighty warrior fall,They should not want a General."As men have long observ'd, that oneMisfortune seldom comes alone;Just in the moment this was done,Ten thousand foes in sight were come;Vultures, and Kites, and birds of prey,In flocks so thick—they darken'd day.A long-concerted force and strong,Vermin of all kinds made the throng;Foxes were in the faction join'd,Who waited their approach to ground.By every hand, from common fame,The frightful face of danger came.One cries, "What help now—who can tell?I'm glad the Eagle 's here, and well!"Another, out of breath with fear,Says, "Thousands more near sea appear;They'll swop our Chicken from the door;We never were so set before:We're glad the Eagle will forget,And the invaders kill or beat."Reserv'd and great, his noble mind,Above all petty things inclin'd,Abhorr'd the thoughts of any thing.But what his Lady's peace could bring:Who bless'd him first, and bade him doAs he was wont, and beat the foe.Burning and restless as the sun,Until this willing work was done;He whets his talons, stretch'd his wings,His lightning darts, and terror flings;Towers with a flight into the sky,These million monsters to descry,Prepar'd to conquer, or to die.The party, that so far was come,Thought not the Eagle was at home:To fame and danger us'd in field,They knew he'd quickly make them yield:But, on assurance he was near,Incumber'd, faint, and dead with fear,They made with hurry towards the lakes;And he his pinions o'er them shakes.They had not (with such horror fill'd)The courage to let one be kill'd:They fled, and left no foe behind,Unless it were the fleeting wind:Only—a man by water tookTwo fine young Merlins and a Rook.The family had now repose:But with the sun the Eagle rose;Th' imperial bird pursued the foe,More toil than rest inur'd to know.He wing'd his way to Latian land,Where first was hatch'd this murdering band;He darted death where-e'er he came,Some of them dying at his name.Their mighty foe—a fatal pledge,Their bowels tore through every hedge:They flutter, shriek, and caw, and hiss;Their strength decays, and fears increase:But most the chevaliers the Geese.So many slaughter'd fowl there was,Their carcases block'd-up the ways;The rest he drove, half spent, pell-mell,Quite to the walls of Pontifell.Robin at home, though mad to hearHe should so conquer every where,Expostulated thus with fear:" Ungrateful I, that so have stirr'dAgainst this generous, noble bird,Wast thou not first by him preferr'd?Let's leave him in his gall to burn,And back to Pontifell return."There some to chimney-tops aspire,To turrets some that could fly higher;Some 'bove a hundred miles were gone,To roost them at Byzantium.Alas! in vain was their pretence,He broke through all their strong defence:Down went their fences, wires, and all;Perches and birds together fall.None hop'd his power to withstand,But gave the nest to his command;They told him of ten thousand more,In flocks along the Ganges' shore,Safe in their furrows, free from trouble,Like Partridges among the stubble.He spreads himself, and cuts the air,And steady flight soon brought him there.Lord, how deceiv'd and vex'd he was!To find they were but meer Jackdaws.A hundred thousand all in light,They all could chatter, not one fight." I'll deal by them as is their due:" Shough! cry'd the Eagle; off they flew."His flashing eyes their hearts confounds,Though by their flight secure from wounds,Which was a signal, fatal baulkTo a late swift Italian Hawk.The Eagle would no rest afford,Till he had sent my Lady word;Who when she heard the dear surprize,Wonder and joy stood in her eyes." My faithful Eagle, hast thou thenMy moral foes destroy'd again?Return, return, and on me wait;Be thou the guardian of my gate;Thee and thy friends are worth my care,Thy foes (if any such there are)Shall my avenging anger share."So—lest new ills should intervene,She turn'd the Robin out again.The Samians now, in vast delight,Bless their good lady day and night;Wish that her life might ne'er be done,But everlasting as the sun.The Eagle high again did soar;The Lady was disturb'd no more,But all things flourish'd as before.ROBIN RED BREAST, WITH THE BEASTS, AN OLD CAT'S PROPHECY;Taken out of an old copy of Verses supposed to be writ by JOHN LIDGATE a Monk of Bury.BY DR. KING. NOT PRINTED IN HIS WORKS.ONE that had in her infant state,While playing at her Father's gate,Seen and was most hugely smittenWith young Dog and dirty Kitten,Had took them up and lug'd them in,And made the servants wash them cleanThe political drift of this pretended prophecy is still more evident than that of the preceding poem; the satire being abundantly more personal. N..When she to a fit age was grown,To be sole Mistress of her own,Then to her favour and strange trustShe rais'd these two; in rank the firstThe Dog: who, with gilt collar grac'd,Strutted about. The cat was plac'dO'er all the house to domineer,And kept each wight of her in fear;While he o'er all the plains had power,That savage Wolves might not devourHer flocks. She gave him charge great careTo take: but beasts uncertain are!Now see by these what troubles riseTo those who in their choice unwisePut trust in such; for he soon join'dWith beast of prey the Dog combin'd,Who kill'd the Sheep, and tore the Hind;While he would stand, and grin, and bark,Concealing thus his dealings dark.A Wolf, or so, sometimes he'd take,And then, O what a noise he'd make!But with wild beasts o'er-run yet areThe plains: some die for want of fare,Or torn, or kill'd; the shepherds findEach day are lost of every kind.Thy silly Sheep lament in vain;Of their hard fate, not him, complain.The shepherds, and the servants all,Against the traitor loudly bawl:But there was none that dar'd to tellTheir lady what to them besel;For Puss a Fox of wondrous artBrought-in, to help, and take their part,By whose assistance to deceive,She made her every lye believe.One lucky day, when she was walkingIn her woods, with servants talking,And stopp'd to hear how very wellA Red-breast sung, then him to dwellWith her she call'd: he came, and tookHis place next to a favourite Rook;Where Robin soon began to singSuch songs as made the house to ring;He sung the loss and death of Sheep,In notes that made the Lady weep:How for his charge the Dog unfit,Took part with foes, and shepherds bit;Ev'n from his birth he did him trace,And shew him cur of shabby race;The first by wandering beggars fed,His sire, advanc'd, turn'd spit for bread;Himself each trust had still abus'd;To steal what he should guard, was us'dFrom puppy: known where-e'er he cameBoth vile and base, and void of shame.The Cat he sung, that none could matchFor venom'd spite, or cruel scratch;That from a Witch transform'd she came,Who kitten'd three of equal fame:This first, one dead, of tabby furThe third survives, much noise of herHad been: a Cat well known, with easeOn errands dark, o'er land and seas,She'd journies take to cub of Bear,From these intriguing beasts, who swearThey'll bring him to defend the wrongThat they have done. Again he sung.How Tabby once, in moon-light night,Trotted with letter Fox did write;In which he sends his best respectsTo the She-bear, and thus directs:" Madam, said he, your cub safe send," None shall his worship soon offend;" It 's all I can at present do" To serve him, as his friends well know."At this the beasts grew in such rage,That none their fury coul assuage;Nay, Puss her Lady would have scratch'd,And tore her eyes, but she was watch'd;For she 'd set up her back, and mew,And thrice ev'n in her face she flew.The Dog, like an ungrateful spark,At her would dare to snarl and bark.Her tenants wondering stood to hearThat she their insolence would bear;And offer'd their assistance toSoon make them better manners know:But she, to avoid all farther rout,Her window opening, turn'd Bob out;Hoping that then her beasts would liveIn peace, and no disturbance give.Yet nothing she can do avails,Their rage against her still prevails;Though Puss was warn'd to fear their fateIn lines (by old prophetic CatWrit before her transformation,When she was in the Witch's station)Foretelling thus: "When beasts are grown" To certain heights, before unknown" Of human race, some shall aloud" Inflame and arm a dreadful crowd," Who in vast numbers shall advance," And to new tunes shall make them dance:" When this begins, no longer hope," For all remains is ax and rope."But, not deterr'd by this, they dar'd,With some who of their plunder shar'd,T' affront their Lady, and conspireTo many with her money hire;Contemning her, to pay undueRegards unto this bestial crew:Though these resembled human shapes,They were indeed no more than Apes;Who some in house, and some in wood,And others in high boxes stood,That chattering made such noise and stir,How all was due to Fox and Cur;Till, by their false deluding way,She found her flocks begin to stray.Still Robin does for her his careAnd zeal express; on whom yet areHis thoughts all fix'd. On her he dreamsEach night. Her praises are his themesIn songs all day. Now perch'd on tree,Finding himself secure and free,He pertly shakes his little wings,Sets up his throat: again he sings," That she had left no other wayTo save her flocks, and end this fray,But soon to her assistance takeOne who could make these monsters shake;A well-known huntsman, who has skillThe fiercest beasts to tame or kill:At her command he'd come, and heWould make her great, and set them free;That, should these beasts some evil dayBring Cub into her grounds, she mayDepend that not herself they'll spare,Since to insult her now they dare:All she at best can hope for then,Is to be safe shut up in de;Since by sure signs all these ingrateAre known to bear her deadly hate."He ends his song, and prays to HeavenThat she may have the wisdom given,Before it be too late, to takeSuch resolutions as may makeHer safe, and that these beasts no moreTo ravage in the plains have power.BIBLIOTHECA: A POEM. OCCASIONED BY THE SIGHT OF A MODERN LIBRARY. WITH SOME VERY USEFUL EPISODES AND DIGRESSIONS.PROBABLY BY THE SAMEThis is ascribed to Dr. King upon conjecture only. It was published in 1712, the winter before he died, by his bookseller, inscribed to his patron, and is very much in his manner. His name is accordingly affixed to the author's notes. The poem is on many accounts worth preserving; and if it is not Dr. King's, it is at least not by an inferior writer. N..—Ridiculum acri" Fortius et melius magnas plerunque secat res."—Utile dulci."HOR.To the most noble Prince HENRY, Duke of Beaufort, Marquis and Earl of Worcester, Earl of Glamorgan, Baron Herbert, Lord of Chepstow, Ragland, and Gower; and the illustrious BrotherhoodThe duke was captain of the band of gentlemen pensioners. N., over which his Grace presides; this POEM is humbly dedicated, by their most obedient, most dutiful, and humble servant.BIBLIOTHECAThough the interests of Virtue and Religion are best secured by the severest reason and argument, yet I hope a less solemn recommendation of them to the world- may not be esteemed a prejudice to either. How oft has a stubborn folly been successfully arraigned by a candid and easy rebuke, which had long maintained itself against a more powerful, though a less familiar, conviction! If we can smile away the follies of an adversary, sport with his vanities, and laugh him into a sense of his errors; why should we forfeit that exquisite pleasure of complacency and good-humour, which a malicious conflict with a rival would most certainly deprive us of? If we miscarry in an attempt of this nature, our defeat would be the less dishonourable, because we seemed only to play and trifle with the mistakes of an author; but should we, under the mask of a little raillery, wit, and good-humour, obtain our end, it would double our satisfaction, as well as the glory of our conquest. Two important debates of the utmost consequence in religion (Eachard's Contempt of the Clergy, and Philautus and Timothy) have with wonderful applause lately appeared in the world; the beauties of their author's stile, the purity of their diction, the elegant turn of thought, and above all a torrent of severe but good-natured wit, drew a thousand readers to peruse an hypothesis they little imagined ever to espouse; but they were insensibly deluded into good principles, and betrayed into a conviction of those very truths they came on purpose to deride and ridicule. Where they expected to gratify a fancy only, they found a more real advantage in the reformation of their judgement, and, from admirers of the author's wit and beauties, became at last proselytes to their opinions. If in two or three instances I have transgressed my own rules, the Fool or the Knave must be imagined very notorious; and that those tender and merciful lashes that were judged sufficient for little offenders would hardly have reached the vanities of the one, or the villainies of the other. And if I am thought to have injured any person in his character, or to have said as much as I am able, I must beg leave to assure the world, that it was owing to abundance of humanity and good-nature I did not say a great deal more; and would rather advise them to sit easy and quiet under the innocent rebukes of a satire, than provoke others to prepare that correction, which their ignorance, their impudence, or both, have so justly deserved.

"Two Friendly Letters from honest Tom Boggy, to the Rev. Mr. Goddard, Canon of Windsor,"
very proper to be racked to the Canon's Sermon;" first printed in 8vo, 1710. This Sermon (full of high treason against High-church, Hereditary Right, and Sacheverell) was intituled,
"The Guilt, Mischief, and Aggravation of Censure; set forth in a Sermon preached in St. George's Chapel within her Majesty's Castle of Windsor, on Sunday the 25th of June, 1710. By Thomas Goddard, A.M. Canon of Windsor. London, printed for B. Lintot, 1710."
 — Mr. Goddard was installed canon May 26, 1707, and was also rector of St. Bennet Finch, London. He published a 30th of January Sermon, in 4to, 1703; and
"The Mercy of God to this Church and Kingdom, exemplified in the several Instances of it, from the Beginning of the Reformation down to the present Time. A Sermon preached in St. George's Chapel at Windsor, on Tuesday the 7th of November, the Day of Thanksgiving, 1710,"
8vo. They were all reprinted in 1715, with three others, under the title of "Six Sermons on several Occasions," 8vo. N.;WRITTEN BY DR. KING, IN THE CHARACTER OF "THE REVIEW."TO Windsor Canon, his well-chosen Friend,The just Review does kindest greeting send.I've found the man by nature's gift design'dTo please my ear and captivate my mind,By sympathy the eager passions move,And strike my soul with wonder and with love!Happy that place, where much less care is hadTo save the virtuous, than protect the bad;Where Pastors must their stubborn Flock obey,Or that be thought a scandal which they say:For, should a sin, by some grand soul belov'd,Chance with an aukward zeal to be reprov'd,And tender conscience meet the fatal curse,Of hardening by reproof, and growing worse:When things to such extremities are brought,'Tis not the Sinner's, but the Teacher's, fault.With Great Mens' wickedness, then, rest content,And give them their own leisure to repent;Whilst their own head-strong will alone must curb them,And nothing vex, or venture to disturb them,Lest they should lose their favour in the court,And no one but themselves be sorry for't.Were I in panegyrick vers'd like you,I'd bring whole offerings to your merit due.You've gain'd the conquest; and I freely own,Dissenters may by Churchmen be out-done.Though once we seem'd to be at such a Distance,Yet both concenter in Divine resistance:Both teach what Kings must do when subjects fight,And both disclaim Hereditary Right.By Jove's command, two Eagles took their flight,One from the East, the source of infant light,The other from the West, that bed of night.The birds of thunder both at Delphi meet,The centre of the world, and Wisdom's seat.So, by a Power not decent here to name,To one fixt point our various notions came.Your thoughts from Oxford and from Windsor flew,Whilst Shop and Meeting-house brought forth ReviewA well-known political paper by De Foe; in which Mr. Goddard's Sermon was immoderately commended. See a long account of this writer, and of Ridpath and Tutchin his associates, in the "Supplement to Swift." N..Your brains fierce Eloquence and Logick tried,My humbler strain choice Socks and Stockings cried;Yet in our common principles we meet,You sinking from the Head, I rising from the Feet.Pardon a hasty Muse, ambitious grown,T' extol a merit far beyond his own.For, though a moderate Painter can't commandThe stroke of Titian's or of Raphael's hand:Yet their transcendent works his fancy raise;And there's some skill in knowing what to praise.RECEIPT TO MAKE AN OATMEAL PUDDING.BY DR.

It is in King's manner. N..PROBABLY BY THE SAME.OF all the delicates which Britons try,To please the palate, or delight the eye;Of all the several kinds of sumptuous fare;There 's none that can with Apple-pye compare,For costly flavour, or substantial paste,For outward beauty, or for inward taste.When first this infant-dish in fashion came,Th' ingredients were but coarse, and rude the frame;As yet unpolish'd in the modern arts,Our fathers eat Brown-bread instead of Tarts;Pyes were but indigasted lumps of dough,Till time and just expence improv'd them so.King Cole (as ancient British annalsSee the old Ballad of "King Cole," in the Anglo-Saxon language, in the second volume of King's Works, p. 87. tell)Renown'd for fiddling and for eating well,Pippins in homely cakes with honey stew'd," Just as he bak'd," the proverb says, "he brew'd!"Their greater art succeeding princes show'd,And model'd paste into a neater mode;Invention now grew lively, palate nice,And Sugar pointed out the way to Spice.But here for ages unimprov'd we stood,And Apple-pye was still but homely food;When god-like Edgar, of the Saxon Line,Poite of taste, and studious to refine,In the Desert perfuming Quinces cast,And perfected with Cream the rich repast.Hence we proceed the outward parts to trim,With Crinkumcranks adorn the polish'd brim;And each fresh Pye the pleas'd spectator greetsWith virgin-fancies, and with new conceits.Dear Nelly, learn with care the pastry art,And mind the easy precepts I impart:Draw out your Dough elaborately thin,And cease not to fatigue your Rolling-pin:Of Eggs and Butter see you mix enough:For then the Paste will swell into a Puff,Which will, in crumpling sounds, your praise report,And eat, as housewives speak, "exceeding short."Rang'd in thick order let your Quinces lie;They give a charming relish to the Pye.If you are wise, you 'll not Brown Sugar slight,The browner (if I form my judgement right)A deep Vermillion tincture will dispense,And make your Pippin redder than the Quince.When this is done, there will be wanting stillThe just reserve of Cloves and Candied Peel;Nor can I blame you, if a drop you takeOf Orange-water, for perfuming-sake.But here the nicety of art is such,There must not be too little, nor too much:If with discretion you these costs employ,They quicken appetite; if not, they cloy.Next, in your mind this maxim firmly root," Never o'ercharge your Pye with costly fruit:"Oft let your Bodkin through the lid be sent,To give the kind imprison'd treasure vent;Lest the fermenting liquor, closely prest,Insensibly, by constant fretting, waste,And o'er-inform your tenement of paste.To chuse your Baker, think, and think again(You 'll scarce one honest Baker find in ten):Adust and bruis'd, I've often seen a Pye,In rich disguise and costly ruin lie,While pensive crust beheld its form o'erthrown,Exhausted Apples griev'd, their moisture flown,And Syrup from the sides ran trickling down.O be not, be not tempted, lovely Nell,While the hot-piping odours strongly smell,While the delicious fume creates a gust,To lick the o'erflowing juice, or bite the crust.You 'll rather stay (if my advice may rule)Until the hot's corrected by the cool;Till you 've infus'd the luscious store of Cream,And chang'd the purple for a silver stream;Till that smooth viand its mild force produce,And give a softness to the tarter juice.Then shalt thou, pleas'd, the noble fabrick view,And, have a slice into the bargain too;Honour and fame alike we will partake,So well I'll eat what you so richly make.THE CHARMS OF LIBERTY: IN ALLUSION TO THE ARCHBISHOP OF CAMBRAY'S TELEMACHUS.BY W. CAVENDISH, DUKE OF DEVONSHIREThis nobleman, the first Duke of Devonshire, is more known for the political integrity of his character, and the spirit with which he resisted the tyrant of his country, than for the abilities which he displayed as a writer. He was born Jan. 25, 1640; and at an early age travelled with Dr. Killigrew, afterwards master of the Savoy, who gave him a just and true relish of poetry, and all the refinements of wit and sense. He joined the party which opposed the arbitrary proceedings of Charles the Second, and was very active in all the measures which were adopted against that monarch and his successor James the Second. On the death of his father, on the 23d of November, 1684, he succeeded him in the title of Earl of Devonshire, and soon after becam a principal promoter of the Revolution, being one o those who secretly planned it, and took up arms to carry th design into execution. On the accomplishment of that important event, he received the rewards which his service merited; and was, on the 30th of April, 1694, create Marquis of Hartington and Duke of Devonshire. He continued to enjoy the favour of his sovereign until the time o his death, which happened on the 18th of August, 1707, i the 67th year of his age. Mr. Walpole observes, that h was
"a patriot among the men, galant among the ladie His friendship with Lord Russell, his free spirit, hi bravery, duels, honours, amours, are well known, an his epitaph, will never be forgotten." WILLIELMUS DUX DEVONIAE" BONORUM PRINCIPUM SUBDITUS FIDELIS," INIMICUS ET INVISUS TYRANNIS." R., 1707.CAMBRAY, whilst of Seraphic Love you write,The noblest themes you set in clearest light;A love by no self-interest debas'd,But on th' Almighty's high perfection plac'd;A love in which true piety consists,That soars to Heaven without the help of priests!Let partial Rome the great attempt oppose,Support the cheat from whence her income flows;Her censures may condemn, but not confute.If best your elevated notions suit,With what to reason seems th' Almighty's due,They have at least an air of being true.And what can animated clay produce,Beyond a guess, in matters so abstruse?But when, descending from the imperial height;You stoop of sublunary things to write,Minerva seems the moral to dispense;How great the subject, how sublime the sense!Not the Alconian Bard with such a flameE'er sung of ruling arts, your lofty theme.In your Telemachus, his hero's son,We see the great Original out-done.There is in Virtue, sure, a hidden charm,To force Esteem, and Envy to disarm;Else in a flattering court you ne'er had been design'dT' instruct the future troublers of mankind.Happy your native soil, at least by nature so,In none her treasures more profusely flow:The hills adorn'd with vines, with flowers the plain,Without the sun's too near approach, serene:But Heaven in vain does on the vineyards smile,The monarch's glory mocks the labourer's toil.What though elaborate brass with nature strive,And proud equestrian figures seem alive;With various terrors on their basis wrought,With yielding citadels, surpriz'd or bought;And here, the ruins of a taken town,There a bombarded steeple tumbling down:Such prodigies of art and costly painsServe but to gild th' unthinking rabble's chains.Oh! abject state of such as tamely groanUnder a blind dependency on one!How far inferior to the herds that range,With native freedom, o'er the woods and plains!With them no fallacy of schools prevail,or of a right divine the nauseous taleCan give to one amongst themselves a power,Without control, his fellows to devour.To reasoning human-kind alone belongThe arts to hurt themselves by reasoning wrong,Howe'er the foolish notion first began,Of trusting absolute to lawless man;Howe'er a tyrant may by force subsist;For who would be a slave that can resist?Those set the casuist safest on the throne,Who make the people's int'rest their own;And, chusing rather to be lov'd than fear'd,Are kings of men, not of a servile herd.Oh Liberty! too late desir'd, when lost!Like health, when wanted, thou art valued most.In regions where no property is known,Through which the Garone runs and rapid Rhone,Where peasants toil for harvests not their own!How gladly would they quit their native soil,And change for liberty their wine and oil!As wretches chain'd and labouring at the oar,In sight of Italy's delightful shoar,Reflect on their unhappy fate the more.Thy laws have still their force; above the restOf Gothic kingdoms, happy Albion, blest!Long since their ancient freedom they have lost,And servilely of their subjection boast:Thy better fate the vain attempts resistsOf faithless monarchs and designing priests;Unshaken yet the government subsists.While streams of blood the continent o'erflow,Reddening the Maese, the Danube, and the Po;Thy Thames, auspicious isle, her thunder sends,To crush thy foes, and to relieve her friends.Say, Muse, since no surprize, or foreign stroke,Can hurt her, guarded by her walls of oak;Since wholesome laws her liberty transferTo future ages, what can Albion fear?Can she the dear-bought treasure throw away?Have Universities so great a sway?The Muse is silent, cautious to reflectOn mansions where the Muses keep their seat.Barren of thought, and niggardly of rhyme,My creeping numbers are forbid to climb;Venturing too far, my weary genius fails,And o'er my drooping senses sleep prevails.An antique pile near Thames's silver streamWas the first object of my airy dream;In ancient times a consecrated fane,But since apply'd to uses more prophane:Fill'd with a popular debating throng,Oft in the right, and oftener in the wrong:Of good and bad the variable test,Where the religion that is voted bestIs still inclin'd to persecute the rest.On the high fabrick stood a monster fell,Of hideous form, second to none in Hell:The Fury, to be more abhorr'd and fear'd,Her teeth and jaws with clods of gore besmear'd,Her party-colour'd robe obscenely stain'dWith pious murthers, freemen rack'd and chain'd,With the implacable and brutish rageOf fierce dragoons, sparing nor sex nor age.With all the horrid instruments of death,Of torturing innocents t' improve their faith,Clouding the roof with their infectious breath.Thus she began: "Are then my labours vain,That to the powers of France have added Spain?Vain my attempts to make that empire great!And shall a woman my designs defeat?Baffle th' infernal projects I've begun,And break the measures of my favourite son?Though far unlike the heroes of her race,That made their humours of their laws take place,And, slighting coronation-oaths, disdain'dTheir high prerogative should be restrain'd:Though her own isle is blest with liberty,Has she a right to set all Europe free?Under this roof, with management, I mayThe progress of her arms at least delay,From a contagious vapour I shall blow;Within those walls breaches may wider grow.Another copy reads,
" Here let imaginary fears prevail," And give a colour to affected zeal." N. Here let imaginary fears be shownOf danger to the church, when there is none.From trivial bills let warm debates arise,Foment sedition, and retard supplies.If once my treacherous arts, and watchful care,Break the Confederacy, and end the war,Ador'd, in Hell I may in triumph fit,And Europe to one potentate submit."Waking at so detestable a sound,Which would all order and all peace confound,I cry'd, "Infernal hag! be ever dumb;Thee, with her arms, let Anna overcome,Who here reigns queen, by Heaven on us bestow'd,To right the injur'd, and subdue the proud.As Rome of old gave liberty to Greece,Anna th' invaded sinking Empire frees.Th' Allies her faith, her power the French proclaim,Her piety th' oppress'd, the world her fame."At Anna's name, dejected, pale, and scar'd,The execrable phantom disappear'd.TO THE RETURNING SUN.BY J. HI cannot ascertain to whom these initials belong; perhaps to Mr. John Hughes. N..WElcome, thou glorious spring of light and heat,Where hast thou made thy long retreat?What lands thy warmer beams possest,What happy Indian worlds thy fruitful presence blest?Where deep in the dark bosom of the ground,Thy wondrous operation's found!Even there thy beams the earth refine,And mix and stamp thy lustre through the dazling mine.Since thy retreat so far from our cold isle,She never wore a lovely smile,No joy her wither'd brow adorn'd,In dark unlovely days and in long nights she mourn'd.The poor dejected beasts hung down their heads,And trembled on their naked beds;No footsteps of green life remain,But dying fields and woods, and a bare bleaky plain.The drooping birds were silent in the groves,They quite forgot their songs and loves,Their feeble mates sate sullen by,We thought the feather'd world resolv'd their kind should dieBut see the land revives at thy approach,She blooms and quickens at thy touch,Her kindled atoms life receive,The meadows, and the groves, begin to stir and live.Mixt with thy beams the southern breezes blow,And help the sprouting births below;The infant flowers in haste appear,And gratefully return perfumes to the kind air.The trees and fields again look fresh and gay,The birds begin their softer play,Thou hast their life, nay more, their love restor'd,Their late and early hymns praise thee, their welcome Lord.The spreading fire glides through the plains and woods,It even pierces the cold floods:The duller brutes feel the soft flame,The fishes leap for joy, and wanton in their stream.ON THE DUTCHESS OF PORTSMOUTHLouise de Queroualle, mistress to Charles II; created dutchess Aug. 9, 1673; died April 11, 1734, at Paris. N..HAD she but liv'd in Cleopatra's age,When beauty did the earth's great lords engage,Britain, nor Egypt, had been glorious made;Augustus then, like Julius, had obey'd:A nobler theme had been the Poet's boast,That all the world for Love had well been lost.THE DREAM, BY MR. J. TALBOTWho this J. Talbot was, I cannot discover; but there was a translation of Seneca's Troas, by J. T. published in 1686; and in a copy thrown out of Lord Bathurst's Library, which I saw, the last initial was filled up with the name of Talbot, and I have no doubt but he is the same person. R.. OCCASIONED BY THE DEATH OF LADY SEYMOURLady Elizabeth Seymour, daughter to William lord Allington, of Horsheath, in the county of Cambridge; she was the second lady of Charles lord Seymour of Trowbridge, and mother to Francis and Charles successively dukes of Somerset. This noble lady was afterwards married to Sir John Ernle, knt. chancellor of the exchequer. N..IF righteous souls in their blest mansions knowOr what we do or suffer here below,And any leisure from their joys can find,To visit those whom they have left behind,To view our endless griefs, our groundless fears,Our hopeless sorrows, and our fruitless tears;With pity, sure, they see the kind mistake,Which weeping friends at their departure make:They wonder why at their release we grieve,And mourn their death, who then begin to live.Tir'd with the care and sorrow of the day,In silent night the sad Maecenas lay,His mind still labouring with the deadly weightOf his dear parent's much-lamented fate:Till weary Nature, with its load opprest,Compos'd the tempest of his troubled breast,And borrow'd from his grief some time for rest:When sleep This idea occurs in "Sable Night," a favourite song in "The Duenna." N. (death's image) to his fancy broughtThe hourly object of his waking thought;And lo! his mother's awful shade appears,Not pale and ghastly, as the sullen fearsOf brain-sick minds their dismal phantoms paint,But bright and joyful as a new-made saint.A crown of glories shone around her head;She smil'd, and thus the happy spirit said:" Hail, noble son, whom powerful Fates designTo fill the glories of thy mighty line,In whom the good is mingled with the great,As generous light unites with active heat!For thee I thought life pleasant, and for theeI after death endur'd this world to see,And leave a while the dwellings of the blest,Where heavenly minds enjoy eternal rest;Where having reach'd the universal shore,I fear the winds and billows now no more;No more in anguish draw a painful breath,Nor wrestle with that mighty tyrant Death,Who cannot boast he gave the fatal blow;I conquer'd sin, from whence his power did flow:The proud insulter threaten'd me in vain,For Heaven increas'd my patience with my pain,Till my unfetter'd soul at last took wing,The grave its conquest lost, and death its sting.No longer then these pious sorrows shed,Nor vainly think thy happy parent dead;Whose deathless mind, from its weak prison free,Enjoys in Heaven its native liberty:I soon distinguish'd in that blissful placeThy god-like ancestors, a numerous race;There, plac'd among the stars, in them I seeA glorious destiny reserv'd for thee.Then weep no more: ev'n here I still survive;In thee and in thy virtuous fair I live;I saw her happy motherLady Elizabeth Audry, wife to Josceline Percy the 11th earl of Northumberland, and after his death married to Ralph lord Montagu, afterwards created duke. N. shine on high,A brighter spirit ne'er adorn'd the sky;With joy she met me at the crystal gate,And much inquir'd her beauteous daughter's state,She wish'd her there: but Heaven ordains it late,And long defers her joys, that she may beA mighty blessing to this world and thee.Long shall she live, and ages yet to comeShall bless the happy burden of her womb:Still shall her off-spring with her years increase;With both, her virtues and thy happiness.In all thy race the wondering world shall findThe noble image of each parent's mind.Thus bless'd in her and hers, thou shalt receiveThe richest bounties Heaven and Earth can give.Nor shall my care be wanting to your aid,My faithful spirit shall hover o'er thy head,And round thy lovely fair a large protection spread:Till, crown'd with years and honours here below,And every gift kind Nature can bestow,You both retire to everlasting rest,And late increase the joys and number of the blest."She spake, her fellow-angels all aroundWith joyful smiles the happy omen own'd;All bless'd the noble pair, and took their flightTo the bright regions of unfading light.ELEGY: BY MR. TALBOT. OCCASIONED BY READING AND TRANSCRIBING MR. WALLER'S "POEM OF DIVINE LOVE" AFTER HIS DEATH.SUCH were the last, the sweetest, notes that hungUpon our dying swan's melodious tongue;Notes, whose strong charms the dullest ear might move,And melt the hardest heart in flames of love;Notes, whose seraphic raptures speak a mindFrom human thoughts and earthly dross refin'd;So just their harmony, so high their flight,With joy I read them, and with wonder write.Sure, happy Saint, this noble song was givenTo fit thee for th' approaching joys of Heaven:Love, wondrous love, whose conquest was thy theme,Has taught thy soul the airy way to climb:Love snatch'd thee, like Elijah, to the sky,In flames that not consume, but purify:There, with thy fellow-angels mix'd, and freeFrom the dull load of dim mortality,Thou feel'st new joys, and feed'st thy ravish'd sight,With unexhausted beams of love and light:And sure, bless'd spirit, to compleat thy bliss,In Heaven thou sing'st this song, or one like this.AGAINST SLOTH: WHEN THE KING WAS AT OXFORD." Hoc agite, ô Juvenes; circumspicit, & stimulat vos," Materiámque sibi Ducis indulgentia quaerit."HEnce, vain attempter of the good and great;Be gone from our secure retreat,With all thy dull unwieldy trainThat clog and curb the active brain,Which else would, like a mettled steed, run o'er,Vast Nature's yet unnumber'd store;O'er flowery meads and painted fields,And all the pleasant scenes that beauteous Learning yields.We're doubly arm'd against thy cheats and thee(Thy cheats which only find a placeAmong the ignorant and base)By Knowledge, and by Majesty.Thou constant guest of every popish cell,Which do'st with Monks and Hermits dwell,Must leave, with them, this sacred ground;Banish'd from King and court, at least for ten miles round.She's gone; and now, methinks, an active fireDoes all my willing veins inspire:My drowsy senses all anewAre waken'd by his powerful view.The glorious ruler of the morning, so,But looks on flowers, and straight they grow;And, when his beams their light unfold,Ripens the dullest earth, and warms it into gold.ODE SUNG BEFORE KING CHARLES II ON NEW-YEAR'S-DAY.BY MR. JACOB ALLESTRYSon of James Allestry, a bookseller of London, who was ruined by the great fire of 1666. Jacob was educated at Westminster school, entered thence at Christ Church in Act Term 1671 at the age of 18, and was elected student in 1672. He took the degrees in Arts; was Music Reader in 1679, and Terrae Filius in 1681,
"both which offices, Wood says, he performed with very great applause, being then accounted a good philologist and poet. But, being exceedingly given to the vices of poets, his body was so much macerated and spent by juvenile extravagances, that he retired to an obscure house in the suburb of Oxon;"
where continuing incognito about 7 weeks, he died in a miserable condition, Oct. 15, 1686, and was buried very meanly in St. Thomas's church-yard, at the east end of the chancel. N.ARISE, great Monarch; see the joyful day,Drest in the glories of the East,Presumes to interrupt your sacred rest.Never did night more willingly give way,Or morn more chearfully appear,Big with the mighty tidings of a New-born Year.Blest be that Sun, who in time's fruitful wombWas to this noble embassy design'd,To head the golden troops of days to come,Nor lagg'd ingloriously behind,Ignobly in the last year's throng to rise and set.In this 'tis happier far than May,Since to add years is greater than to give a day.CHORUS.Oh may the happy days increase,With spoils of war, and wealth of peace,Till Time and Age shall swallow'd be,Lost in vast Eternity!May Charles ne'er quit his sacred throne,Himself succeed himself alone!And, to lengthen out his time,Take, God, from us, and give to him;That so each world a Charles may know,Father above, and son below.Hark, the jocund spheres renewTheir chearful and melodious song,While the glad Gods are pleas'd to viewThe rich and painted throngOf happy days in their fair order march along.Move on, ye prosperous hours, move on;Finish your course so well begun;Let no ill omen dare prophaneYour beauteous and harmonious train,Or jealousies or foolish fears disturb you as you run.See, mighty Charles, how all the minutes press,Each longing which shall first appear;Since, in this renowned year,Not one but feels a secret happinness,As big with new events and some unheard success:See how our troubles vanish, seeHow the tumultuous tribes agree.Propitious winds bear all our griefs away,And peace clears up the troubled day.Not a wrinkle, not a scarOf faction or dishonest war,But pomps and triumphs deck the noble kalendar.WHAT ART THOU, LOVE?BY MR. ALLESTRY.WHat art thou, Love! whence are those charms!That thus thou bear'st an universal rule!For thee the soldier quits his arms,The king turns slave, the wise man fool.In vain we chace thee from the field,And with cool thoughts resist thy yoke:Next tide of blood, alas! we yield,And all those high resolves are broke.Can we e'er hope thou should'st be true,Whom we have found so often base?Cozen'd and cheated, still we view,And fawn upon the treacherous face.In vain our nature we accuse;And doat because she says we must:This for a brute were an excuse,Whose very soul and life is lust.To get our likeness! what is that?Our likeness is but misery;Why should I toil to propagateAnother thing as vile as I?From hands divine our spirit came,And Gods, that made us, did inspireSomething more noble in our Frame,Above the dregs of earthly fire.VERSES AND PASTORALSMr. Allestry had the chief hand (as Wood was informed) in making the Verses and Pastorals which were spoken in the Theatre of Oxford, May 21, 1681, by William Savile second son of George earl (afterwards marquis) of Halifax, and George Cholmondeley third son of Robert viscount Cholmondeley of Kellis (both of Christ Church), before James duke of York, his dutchess, and the lady Anne. N., SPOKEN IN THE THEATRE AT OXFORD,BY LORD SAVILEBy the death of his eldest brother, this young nobleman succeeded to his father's title of marquis of Halifax; which, on his own decease in 1699, became extinct. N. AND MR. CHOLMONDELEY.LORD SAVILE TO THE DUKE OF YORK.GREAT SIR,WHen last your Royal brother blest this place,And all about did his kind beams dispense,A joy divine was seen in every face,Till Faction drove our tutelar angel hence.Heaven knew how far our mortal frame could bear;Mingling our rapture with some fit allay;And, that for future bliss we might repair,Wisely reserv'd the blessing of this day.MR. CHOLMONDELEY TO THE DUKE.We miss'd a Royal brother by his side;LORD SAVILE TO THE DUTCHESS.We long'd to see those charms which him o'ercame.MR. CHOLMONDELEY TO THE LADY ANNE.You, Madam, was our only joy and pride,Who represented half the Stuart's name.LORD SAVILE TO THE DUKE.Would you then know how much you're welcome hereThink what a joy in Royal breasts did flow,When fatal Glo'ster all our hopes did bear,Which the Gods lost to shew their care of you.When fears and jealousies ran high and loud,And Zeal mistaken blinded wilful eyes,Heaven shook the rod to the rebellious crowd,Threatening to snatch the gem they could not prize.MR. CHOLMONDELEY TO THE DUTCHESS.Oxford, we hope, will not displease your view,Where York first learn'd the rudiments of war;Those early virtues here in blossom grew,Which now in growth and full perfection are.This young gentleman was made cornet of horse in 168. On king William's accession he was appointed one of the grooms of his bedchamber, and served in all the wars during that reign. He was constituted major general of queen Anne's forces July 1, 1702, and governor of the forts of Tilbury and Gravesand. He was continued in his employments, and promoted by George I. who created him baron of Newborough in Ireland March 15, 1714 15; and baron Newburgh in England July 2, 1716. He succeeded his brother as earl of Cholmondeley, March 20, 1724-5; and died May 17, 1733. N.Though here new towers and buildings daily rise,And, arms thrown off, we wear the peaceful gown;Our breasts admit no change, know no disguise,Prepar'd with pens and swords t' assert the Crown.LORD SAVILE.This is the place to which the sacred namesOf Kings and Heroes annually resound;The triumphs, wars, and peace of Charles and James,From age to age are with fresh laurels crown'd.MR. CHOLMONDELEY.As when a prince's long expected birth,Glads every heart, and each Muse tunes her voice;TO THE LADY ANNE.Or when the captive monarchs of the earthBeg to be slaves, and in your chains rejoice—LORD SAVILEBut why in lazy numbers do we bindOur thoughts; which should in active raptures fly,As the coelestial circles unconfin'd,And tun'd to their eternal harmony?Musick's the dialect of happy souls,When sever'd from the earth's unwieldy load;The universal language, by both polesOf the vast distant nations understood.Let instruments and voices both combine,To celebrate the glories of this day:Let art and ecstacy their forces join,And in melodious paths of error stray.Here they sat down, and music played; which being ended, they stood up again, and spoke by way of PastoralThe character of Damon was supported by Lord Savile; that of Thyrsis by Mr. Cholmondeley. N..DAMON.Thyrsis, whom the Gods inspire,Glory of our tuneful quire,What auspicious powers dispenseThis day's happy influence?See'st thou how the nymphs and swainsTrip it o'er the flowery plains,Deck'd in liveries far more gayThan could e'er be given by May?Craggy hills their tops advance,Fauns and Satyrs on them dance;To the whistling of the wind,With the birds sweet music join'd;Trees, with their unwonted pleasure,Wave their shady tops in measure.THYRSIS.Damon, think it nothing strangeYou discern so great a change,Since our humble dwelling's blestWith so strange, so great a guest.Life and mirth the Gods bestow,And beauty, wheresoe'er they go;And, if Jove vouchsafe to comeTo Philemon's country home,His presence gives it grace divine,And turns the cottage to a shrine.DAMON.Such fine stories poets sing,How their Gods, and Jove their king,Envy shepherds' happy days,Pleas'd to hear their well-tun'd lays;Quit the blissful seats above,Chusing here on earth to love.Pretty fables, proper themesFor poetic airy dreams;But these are joys which men awakeNever must expect to take.THYRSIS.Cease thy doubts, thou faithless swain.View but yonder glorious train,Tell me if the skies can showSuch a constellation?DAMON.No.THYRSIS.Should the Deities combine,And in one their glories join;DAMON.Heaven's whole pride too mean would beTo compare with what we see.But pr'ythee, shepherd, canst declareWhat these glorious strangers are?THYRSIS.Damon, that's a work too highFor such swains as you and I.'Tis enough our softer laysAlcon or Lycoris praise:But the princely Daphnis' nameFills the loudest trump of fame.DAMON.Oft was Daphnis the sublimeArgument of Aegon'sThe poetical name by which the earl of Rochaster was distinguished. See vol. II. p. 125. N. rhyme:THYRSIS.Daphnis, and the Nymph that shares.All his pleasures, all his cares.DAMON.While he sung his victories,THYRSIS.And her no less conqu'ring eyes,DAMON.Glad rocks echoed to his voice,THYRSIS.Vales return'd the tuneful noise.DAMON.Savage inmates of the woodAll compos'd and listening stood:THYRSIS.Distant hills their tops did bend,Leaning as they did attend.But, since Aegon left the plain,All the under crew in vainStrive to sing what may appearWorthy princely Daphnis' ear.DAMON.Fear not, Thyrsis, there does restIn great Daphnis' noble breastToo much goodness, to refuseTribute from an humble Muse:Did the Gods accept aloneWorthy victims, they'd have none.THYRSIS.Then, though we cannot entertainDaphnis in a lofty strain,Nor his great exploits set forth,Or his peerless lady's worth;Such a homely Muse as oursCan bid them welcome to these bowers.Damon begin: to Phyllis I,Thou to Daphnis shalt apply.DAMON.Content.THYRSIS.But stay.DAMON.Why stay?THYRSIS.Mine earHeavenly music seems to hear;Phoebus will his quire prevent,And pay the duty which we meant,DAMON.Let's attend while Phoebus sings,And tune our oat-pipes to his strings.Musick again; which ended,Ah, Thyrsis! how shall humble swains,As thou and I, perform such strains?Can we a fitting present make,For us to give, or these to take?THYRSIS.The garland Chloris made, I'll bring;When I flung Strephon from the ring.Though Caesar's birth-day it should crown,Fresh roses will for that be blown.DAMON.I have a lamb as white as snow:Though half engag'd to Pan by vow,I'll sacrifice it here; for hePan or some greater. God must be.THYRSIS.Why dost thou talk of sacrificeThese seem not angry Deities.Would cruel Sylvia were here!She'd learn to think herself less fair,And in a noble mixture findHumility with beauty join'd.DAMON.Then may it please the royal Three;T' accept an hearty wish from me;By all true swains be Daphnis fear'd,And no Whig wolves come near his herd!THYRSIS.May each bright nymph look gay and young;Doubling the stook from whence they sprung!BOTH.Then yearly hecatombs we'll pay,If every Spring brings such a May.TO A PERSON OF HONOURThe honourable Edward Howard, by his poem called "The British Princes," engaged the attention of by far the most eminent of his contemporaries; who played upon his vanity, as the wits of half a century before had done on that of Thomas Coriat, by writing extravagant compliments on his work. See Butler's verses, in the English Poets, vol. VII. p. 197; Waller's, vol. VIII. p. 179; Denham's, vol. IX. p. 143; Sprat's, in the same volume, p. 162; and the Duke of Dorset's, vol. XI. p. 187. N., ON HIS INCOMPARABLE POEM.BY MR. MATTHEW CLIFFORDThe ingenious writer, to whom Dr. Spratt addressed his Life of Cowley. He was master of the Charter-house. N..WITH envy, criticks, you'll this poem read,Whose author's wit does more than man exceed;Where all's so good alike, no man can sayThis may be added, or that par'd away:Where all's so new, no search can ever traceThe persons mention'd; in their time, or place.Great soul of nature! which dost books defy,And their weak aid in this thy history:Thou art no slave to rule, or precedent;Where others imitate, thou dost invent.It is, we grant; all thy invention;The language too, intirely is thy own;Thou leav'st as trash, below thy great pretence,Grammar to pedants; and to plain men, sense:But, as in this thy matchless poetryThou follow'st none, so none can follow thee.ON THE SAME,BY THE LORD VAUGHANJohn lord Vaughan, grandson to Richard the first earl of Carbery. He was made a knight of the Bath at the coronation of Charles II. and was for some time governor of Jamaica. The latter part of his days were passed in retirement, enjoying a fine fortune, greatly improved by his own excellent conduct. In this interval he built a handsome mansion-house at Chelsea; where he died, Jan. 16, 1712-13. Anne his only daughter and heir was married in 1713 to Charles marquis of Winchester, heir apparent to the duke of Bolton; who never cohabited with her. She died Sept. 20, 1751. N..WOnder not, sir, that praises yet ne'er dueTo any other are yet heap'd on you:'Twas envy robb'd you of your praise before;Men see their faults, and envy now no more.'Tis but your merit; nor can justly such,Which gave too little once, now give too much.Your "Princes" do all Poetry surpassAs much as Pen-main-maur exceeds Parnass.It is so great a prodigy of Wit,That Art and Nature both fall short of it:For, leaving Art, and left of Nature too,Your Poem has no other Muse than you.ON THE SAME.AS when a bully draws his sword,Though no man gives him a cross word,And all persuasions are in vain,To make him put it up again:Each man draws too, and falls upon him:Ev'n so, dear Ned, thy desperate penNo less disturbs all witty men,And makes them wonder what a devil;Provokes thee to be so uncivil.When thou and all thy friends must know 'em,Thou yet wilt dare to print thy poem.That poor cur's fate, and thine, are oneWho has his tail pegg'd in abone;About he runs, nobody 'll own him,Men, boys, and dogs, are all upon him:And first the greater wits were at thee,Now every little fool will pat thee;Fellows that ne'er were heard or read of.If thou writ'st on, will write thy head off.Thus mastiffs only have a knackTo cast the bear upon his back;But, when th' unwieldy beast is thrown,Mungrils will serve to keep him down.PROLOGUE, SPOKEN AT THE OPENING OF THE DUKE'S NEW PLAY-HOUSE IN DORSET-GARDEN.'TIS not in this as in the former age,When Wit alone suffic'd t' adorn the stage;When things well-said an audience could invite,Without the hope of such a gaudy sight:What with your fathers took would take with you,If Wit had still the charm of being new:Had not enjoyment dull'd your appetite,She in her homely dress would yet delight;Such stately theatres we need not raise,Our Old House would put off our dullest plays.You, Gallants, know a fresh wench of sixteenMay drive the trade in honest bombazine;And never want good custom, should she lieIn a back room, two or three stories high:But such a beauty as has long been known,Though not decay'd, but to perfection grown,Must, if she think to thrive in this lewd town,Wear points, lac'd petticoats, and a rich gown:Her lodgings too must with her dress agree,Be hung with damask, or with tapestry;Have china, cabinets, and a great glass,To strike respect into an amorous ass.Without the help of stratagems and arts,An old acquaintance cannot touch your hearts,Methinks 'tis hard our authors should submitSo tamely to their predecessors' wit;Since, I am sure, among you there are fewWould grant your grand-fathers had more than you.But hold! I in this business may proceed too far,And raise a storm against our theatre;And then what would the wise adventurers say,Who are in a much greater fright to-dayThan ever poet was about his play?Our apprehensions none can justly blame,Money is dearer much to us than fame:This thought on, let our poets justifyThe reputation of their poetry;We are resolv'd we will not have to doWith what's between those gentlemen and you.Be kind, and let our house have but your praise,You're welcome every day to damn their plays.SONG.AS he lay in the plain, his arm under his head,And his flocks feeding by, the fond Celadon said,If Love's a sweet passion, why does it torment?If a bitter (said he), whence are Lovers content?Since I suffer with pleasure, why should I complain?Or grieve at my fate, when I know 'tis in vain?Yet so pleasing the pain is, so soft is the dart,That at once it both wounds me, and tickles my heart:To myself I sigh often without knowing why;And, when absent from Phyllis, methinks I could die.But oh! what a pleasure still follows my pain;When kind Fortune does help me to see her again!In her eyes, the bright stars that foretell what's to come,By soft stealth now and then I examine my doom.I press her hand gently, look languishing down,And by passionate silence I make my love known.But oh! how I'm blest when so kind she does prove,By some willing mistake to discover her love;When, in striving to hide, she reveals all her flame,And our eyes tell each other what neither dare name.THE PRISONER IN THE TOWER.TO THE LADY M. C.WHILST Europe is alarm'd with wars,And Rome foments the Christian jars;Whilst guilty Britain fears her fate,And would repent her crime too late;Here, safe in my confin'd retreat,I see the waves about me beat,And envy none that dare be great.A quiet conscience, and a friend,Help me my happy hours to spend;Let Celia to my cell resort,She turns my prison to a court;Instead of guards by day and night,Let Celia still be in my sight.And then they need not fear my flight.Could sense of servile fear prevail,Or could my native honour fail,Her sight would all my doubts control,And give her back my peaceful soul:Such charming truths her words contain;Or, if her angel voice refrain,Her eyes can never plead in vain.LOVE BUT ONE.SEE these two little brooks that slowly creep,In snaky writhings through the plains,I knew them once one river swift and deep,Blessing and blest by poets strains.Then touch'd with awe, we thought some God did pourThose floods out of his sacred jarr;Transforming every weed into a flower,And every flower into a star.But since it broke itself, and double glides,The naked banks no dress have worn;And you dry barren mountain now deridesThese vallies, which lost glories mourn.Such, Chloris, is thy love: which, while it ranConfin'd within a single stream,Fir'd every tuneful son of mighty Pan:And thou wert mine, and all men's theme.But, when imparted to one Lover more,It in two streams did faintly creep;The shepherd's common Muse grew low and poor,And mine as lean as these my sheep.Alas! that honour, Chloris, thou hast lost,Which we to thy full flood did pay!While now that swain, that swears he loves thee most,Slakes but his thirst, and goes away!SONG ON A LADY INDISPOSED.BY MR. BEVIL HIGGONSAn account of this poet has been already printed in vol. I. p. 128; to which the following anecdote may be added. "King Charles II. sold Dunkirk to Louis XIV. and gave him English oak enough to build the very fleet that afterwards attacked and defeated one of ours in Bantry Bay on the coast of Ireland. This puts me in mind of the foresight of a gentleman, who had been some time envoy from the king to the princes and states of Italy, and who, in his return home, made the coast of France his road; in order to be as useful to his country as possible, and to his sovereign too, as he thought. In his audience of the king, he told his majesty, that the French were hard at work, building men of war in several of their ports, and that such a hasty increase of the naval power of France could not but threaten England's sovereignty of the seas, and consequently portend destruction to her trade. The gentleman was in the right, for our trade and the sovereignty of the seas are dependent on each other; they must live or die together. But what a recompense do you think he met with for his fidelity? really such a one as I would hardly have believed, had I been told it by any person but his own son, the late Mr. Bevil Higgons, whose works, both in prose and verse, have made him known to all the men of letters in Britain, and whose attachment to the family of Stuart, even to his dying day, puts his veracity in this point out of dispute. The recompence was a severe reprimand from the king, as the fore-runner to the laying him aside, for talking of things which his majesty told him it was not his business to meddle with." I forget from which of the political writers between 1730 and 1740 this anecdote was transcribed; most probably The Craftsman. N..FLAVIA'S eyes, like fires suppress'd,More fiercely flame again;Nor can her beauty be decreas'd,Nor alter'd by her pain.Those various charms which round her play,And do her face adorn,Still as they ripen, fall away,Fresh beauties still are born.So doth it with the lovers fare,Who do the dame adore,One fit of love kill'd by despair,Another rages more.TO SIR GODFREY KNELLER, DRAWING LADY HYDE'S PICTURE.BY MR. HIGGONS.THE Cyprian Queen, drawn by Apelles' hand,Of perfect beauty did the pattern stand.But then bright nymphs from every part of GreeceDid all contribute to adorn the piece;From each a several charm the painter took(For no one mortal so divine could look).But, happier Kneller, Fate presents to youIn one that finish'd beauty which he drew.But oh, take heed, for vast is the design,And madness 'twere for any hand but thine.For mocking thunder bold Salmoneus dies;And 'tis as rash to imitate her eyes.TO A LADY, WHO, RAFFLING FOR THE KING OF FRANCE'S PICTURE, FLUNG THE HIGHEST CHANCES ON THE DICE.BY THE SAME.FORTUNE exerts her utmost power for you,Nor could she more for her own Louis do;She thought some mighty kingdom was the stake,And did his throw for the great monarch make.But as all princes at far distance wooe,First send their image where their heart is due;So now, thrice happy nymph, would you resort,Where Fate invites you, to the Gallic court,That lucky genius which the picture gaveWould make the great original your slave:He, like the piece, can only be your prize,Who never yields but to the brightest eyes.ON LADY SANDWICH'SElizabeth, countess of Edward the third earl. N. BEING STAYED IN TOWN BY THE IMMODERATE RAIN.BY MR. HIGGONS.THE charming Sandwich would from cities fly,While at her feet adoring princes lie;And all her nobler conquests would forego,Less glorious slaves and peasants to subdue.Thus conquering monarchs, who have kingdoms won,And all their neighbouring states with arms o'er-run,For want of work their armies to employ,Remote and savage provinces destroy:But Heaven in pity weeps, while we complain,Or else our tears exhal'd drop down in rain;The darken'd sun does scarce through clouds appear,And tempests rage to keep our wishes here;The floods free passage to her scorn deny,And Nature disobeys her cruelty.But, could the waves rise equal to our flame,We'd drown the world, to stop the flying dame.TO MR. POPE.BY THE SAME.THY wit in vain the feeble critick gnaws;While the hard metal breaks the serpent's jaws.Grieve not, my friend, that spite and brutal rageAt once thy person and thy Muse engage:Our virtues only from ourselves can flow,Health, strength, and beauty, to blind chance we owe.But Heaven, indulgent to thy nobler part,In thy fair mind express'd the nicest art:Nature, too busy to regard the whole,Forgets the body, to adorn the soul.OF THE IMMORTALITY OF THE MUSES.BY HENRY CROMWELLBetter known as the friend and correspondent of Mr. Pope, than by any writings of his own. It was from a mistress of this gentleman (Mrs. Thomas, or, as she was commonly called, Corinna) that Curll obtained the first Letters of Mr. Pope that were exhibited to public view. N., ESQ.INSCRIBED TO MR. DRYDEN.THY well-known malice, fretful Envy, cease,Nor tax the Muse and me—With a weak genius, and inglorious ease;What!—I should then, whilst youth does vigour yield,Pursue the dusty glories of the field;Our fathers' praise! or bend my utmost careTo the dull noise of the litigious bar.No! these must die;—but the most noble prize,That which alone can man immortalize,Must from the Muses' harmony arise:Homer shall live, whilst Tenedos shall stand,Or Ida's top survey the neighbouring strand,Whilst Simois' streams along the valleys glide,And in the sea discharge their rapid tide:—Hesiod shall live, till corn is not in use,Till the plump grape denies its wealthy juice:—The world Callimachus shall ever prize;For what his fancy wants, his art supplies:—The tragedies of mighty SophoclesShall in no age their just applauses miss:—So well Aratus of the planets wrote,That sun and moon must fail when he's forgot:—When crafty Davus a hard father cheatsTo serve the son; when easy cully treatsThe jilting whore and bawd; the figures shew,The Comick from Menander's model drew;—Ennius, whose Muse by Nature was design'dCompleat, had Art with bounteous Nature join'd;—And tragic Accius, of style sublimeAnd weighty words, shall stand the shock of Time:—Whilst Jason's golden fleece shall have a name,Who shall a stranger be to Varro's fame!—Lucretius Nature's causes did rehearseIn such a lofty and commanding verse,As shall remain till that one fatal day,Which must the world itself in ruins lay:—Virgil, thy Works Divine shall patterns standFor each succeeding age's copying hand,Whilst Rome shall all its conquer'd world command:—Whilst Cupid shall be arm'd with bow and dart,And flaming shafts shall pierce the lover's heart;Shall we, O sweet Tibullus, love each lineThat comes from that soft moving pen of thine:—Both East and West resound with Gallus' fame,Gallus and his Lycoris are their theme:—Statues and tombs with age consume and die;'Tis verse alone has immortality:To verse must yield the greatest acts of kings;Riches and empire are but empty things,Without the lasting fame a poet brings.Let vulgar spirits trivial blessings choose;May thy Castalian spring inspire my Muse,O God of wit, and myrtles wreath my hair!Then the too fearful lover may repairTo what I write, to free his breast from care.As living worth detraction still attends,Which after death a juster fame defends;So I shall my last funeral flame survive,And in my better part for ever live.ODE TO SYLVIA.IN IMITATION OF PRIOR.IN flowery flelds, in cool retreats,With wounded heart and weeping eyes,I've sought the happy Muses' seats,Since first your beauty did surprize.But, oh! too late my doom's declar'd:These charming scenes create desire;For every sight inflames the bard,And every breath foments the fire.I, who Love's golden darts defy'd,His pointed shafts, his piercing bow,An all-commanding force have try'd;Yet sink beneath the mighty woe.Cease, dear disturber of my rest,Let some choice remedy be found;Oh! may the spear that struck my breastAssuage the grief, and heal the wound!Your charms inthrall, your wit confines,Each sprightly swain that views the field:Where your prevailing lustre shines,The fairest nymphs are forc'd to yield.So, when the splendid lamp of dayShoots forth his wide-extending fires;Each star contracts his sickly ray,And with a fading pomp retires.THE APPARITION, BY ABEL EVANSDr. Abel Evans, the author of this and the following poems, though a man of genius, the friend of the first poets of the times, and applauded by them, is now hardly known. He is generally styled Dr. Evans the Epigrammist, and was one of the Oxford wits enumerated in the following distich (wretchedly imitated in the "Additions to Pope," vol. I. p. 163.):
" Alma novem genuit celebres Rhedycina poetas;" Bub, Stubb, Cobb, Crabb, Trapp, Young, Carey, Tickell, Evans."
He is likewise mentioned in the Dunciad, B. II. ver. 116. in company with Dr. Young and Dean Swift, as one of the authors whose works had been claimed by James More Smith. Dr. Evans was of St. John the Baptist's College, Oxford; and took the degree of M.A. March 23, 1699; that of B.D. April 26, 1705; and D.D. May 16, 1711. He was bursar to his college; vicar of St. Gyles's, Oxford; and appears to have been intimate with Mr. Pope, to whom there are two letters by him in print, in one of which the initial letter W. (intended for his Christian name) is by mistake put instead of that by which he used to sign himself. R., D.D. OCCASIONED BY THE PUBLICATION OF TINDAL'S RIGHTS OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH."

VI. 264.BEGIN, my Muse; the dire adventure tell,How the supremest gloomy Power of HellConvers'd familiar with a mortal Man;Where, when, and how, the conference began;Bring each particular in open sight,And do the Devil and the Doctor right.As round the world that restless spirit flew,This spacious Earth and all her sons to view;To see how Treason, Lust, and Murder stroveTo fill his realms, and empty those above;While Truth was trampled on by Lies and Spite,And Wrong victorious triumph'd over Right;Vice domineer'd, and haughty swore aloud,Surrounded with a numerous flattering crowd;Virtue, with blushes cover'd o'er, retir'd,By all forsaken; though by all admir'd;Silent she griev'd, with pity, at the sight,Then wing'd tow'rds Heaven her solitary flight.Not so the Fiend, with other passions fraught,Exulting, on his mighty conquests thought:Wide to his view the lovely prospect lay,But still with joy malign he ey'd the prey:For some escaping made his madness rise,Louring he scowl'd, and darken'd all the skies:Unmindful of the many, Satan stood,Revenge against those flying few he vow'd:Then toss'd the vipers round his horrid head,And thus indignant to himself he said:" These kingdoms of the Earth of old were given,If I mistake not, in exchange for Heaven:Their power, their wealth, and glory, all are mine;I hold them from above by grant divine.Uxorious Adam, by my cunning crost,Forfeit to treason, all their tenures lost:Then, if I hold by titles such as these,Who shall my tenures dare dispute or seize?Yet—for all this—spite of my sovereign will,Some nations do decline their homage still.The three great quarters of the world are mine;See how their altars smoak, and temples shine!—In Europe too, nor am I less rever'dWhere grateful Rome her images has rear'd:Or where Fanatic Sectaries abound,I scower with pleasure my devouring round:But Albion, cursed isle! by Priests misled,False to my hopes, is in rebellion bred.Not that my emissaries there I want:Atheists to curse, and Hypocrites to cant.BurgessThe celebrated Dissenter. aloft harangues the gaping crowd,While witty GarthThe great physician. N. below blasphemes aloud;And to each other, though so opposite,Yet in my cause both lovingly unite:The Toleration to my wish proceeds,Neglected gardens must be choak'd with weeds.Oh, could I sink the Sacramental Test!Down falls at once the Altar and the Priest:For still th' Establish'd Church is all my bane;And, while that stands, I ne'er must hope to reign.But then that Oxford, damn'd pedantic town!Thus to be fool'd by a square-cap and gown!How old and silly, Satan, art thou grown!—But 'tis resolv'd, new measures I will try,Quick to All-Souls, to Tindal I will fly:Tindal, alike with me by GOD accurs'd;In vice and error from his cradle nurs'd:He studies hard, and takes extreme delight,In whores or heresies to spend the night:My vassal sworn! he loves Confusion's cause,And hates, like me, all government and laws:All ties of duty, gratitude, are vain;No bonds his furious malice can restrain:All interests, civil, sacred, still uniteWith idle toil, to check his ardent spite."Thus having said, quick down to earth he fell;Full in the middle of the Quadrangle:With sudden glance he travers'd all the rooms,And then forthwith a human shape assumes.Like an old College-bedmaker he bent;His cloven-foot he wriggled as he went;A frowzy high-crown'd hat his face did hide,A hooked staff his tottering steps did guide,A bunch of various keys hung jangling by his side.Quick to the Doctor's chamber he repair'd,Three solemn raps upon the door were heard;The Doctor, listening, trembled, swore, and star'd.And in an instant tow'rds the door he goes,The door, self-opening, took him thwart the nose.Astonish'd, back he started with a bound;And thought, at least, he trod enchanted ground.But, as the spectre nearer to him drew,Resolv'd at last, he cries, "Zounds! what are you?"The Spright, observing streight his great confusion,Thus calmly silence broke (as he who knows one):" Dear Doctor! pr'ythee do not tremble so:Pray be compos'd! what?—not Crippelia know!The Devil is not come to fetch you now.Once I was young, nor wanted female charms,When I lay panting in your curling arms:Lock'd in the folds of Love, we both defy'dThe Statutes, and the Laws of GOD beside.Then, my Civilian! as intranc'd you lay,How did you sigh and kiss the hours away!Not Alexander, with Statira blest,His passion with more tenderness express'd.What though with age and weakness now I bend,With wrinkles shrivel'd—for one tumbler send:If not a mistress, use me like a friend.For favours past, some small regards are due;I would not at these years have flouted you!Turn then, Barbarian, turn thy lovely eyes;Survey me well:—and mark my thin disguise.—No musty college-matron here thou see'st;Them and their masters I alike detest,Abhor, as thou dost any Christian priest.Before thee stands Hell's mighty sovereign king:My subjects thanks for thy last works I bring.All my grim sons, with emulation fir'd,Restless, thy Rights, thy Christian Rights requir'd,Thy Christian Church's Rights: immortal page,Worthy thy malice, impudence, and rage!Envious they ask, in sullen surly mood,What Incubus did o'er thy fancy brood?All Hell resounds thy name with loud applause,And love the leader, as they like the cause:But above all, the hot-brain'd Athiest crew,That ever Greece, or Rome, or Britain, knew,Wave all their laurels, and their palms to you.Spinoza smiles, and cries—The work is done;Tindal shall finish (Satan's darling son!)Tindal shall finish what Spinoza first begun.Hobbes, Milton, Blount, Vanini, with him join;All equally admire the vast design.Then—to the trumpet's and the clarion's sound;The giddy goblets whirl in eddies round,To Tindal's health:—on earth may Tindal dwell!Late may we have his presence here in Hell!Till he the glorious work has done, they cry,Till Christian churches all in ruins lie!(Sonorous shoutings rend the livid sky.)No single fiend, through all the numerous host,Declines the glass, when Tindal is the toast.Old Epicurus to Lucretius bow'd,Young, witty, learn'd, vain, impudent, and proud:Diagoras next Apollonius sate;The solemn sages on thy works debate:The traitor Judas, listening, grimning, stood;Sometimes he mus'd, and then he laugh'd aloud:'Twixt rage, and hate, and scorn, at last he cries,Curse on thee, for thy silly random kiss,To take the Founder, and the Church to miss!Apostate Julian rose, and loudly swore,The Galilean's empire was no more;His royal priesthood should for ever cease,And Satan shall regain the realms of bliss."By this time Tindal quite recover'd stood;His visage redden'd with returning blood;And thus he answer'd (when he thrice had bow'd):Dr. "Great are the honours, which the Prince of HellBestows upon a mortal Infidel:Nor with less pleasure I the praises hearYour subjects to my trifling labours spare;Neither to you nor them, I must confess,My duty, as I ought, I can express:Fain would I merit more! would they but praise me less.But give me leave (as I'm in duty bound)To pay thee, Satan! reverence most profound(Here with his head nine times he touch'd the ground).Civility surprizing, I acknowledge;To visit a poor Fellow of a College!For Hell's dread emperor to condescend,Himself, to see a vile terrestrial friend!Tell me, ye Gods of Erebus and Night!How have ye heard of such a worthless wight!What thanks are then, Supreme Apostate! dueFrom me (the meanest of God's foes) to you?"S. "Egregious youth! thou last best hopes of Hell!All Satan's sons have hitherto done well;But thou all Satan's sons do'st far excel.—However, let us not, my worthy friend,Our time in ceremonies only spend:Nine times three minutes I can only stay,And cannot bear the least approach of day:Then to the business quickly let us come;'Tis what you study here, and I at home.The Church of England is the cursed thing,That you and I must to destruction bring."D. "Thanks, great Destroyer! if so mean a manAs I but work such mighty mischief can;No time nor cost I'll spare; no strength or pains(The Church of England's losses are my gains).Some Deanry then to my lay-fee shall fall;The Bishopricks—my betters must have—All."S. "I tell thee, Tindal, and observe it well:Merit like thine does all reward excel.For gold, or fame, let little souls contend;Disinterested mischief be thy end:Only with patience in thy work persist;To Hell's infernal Caesar leave the rest."D. "Oh, Emperor! what merit can I claim,The youngest hero in thy lists of fame?Had I of old (as Scripture-annals sing)Wag'd war with thee 'gainst Heaven's perpetual King;Had I (but only on the conquer'd side)Display'd with thee my vanity and pride;Some laurel then I could with pleasure wear,And without blushing now my praises hear."S. "Extremes on all sides we with justice blame;A little then thy headstrong rage reclaim;And try thy lust of anarchy to tame.Mischief enough remains on earth undone;Then check thy flight tow'rds Heaven, my towering son,The greatest worth still bounds and limits knows;Be satisfy'd—and gall thy present foes.The Christian Church is still in safety found;Let that be first quite level'd to the ground.When thou hast finish'd this (no small design),Thou may'st with reason for fresh mischief pine:And, before all the Christian Churches, stillLet Albion's Church employ thy utmost skill;Quick against that thy second battery raise,And equal to thy mischief be thy praise.Her Clergy first with foulest lyes defame;Her Clergy, of whatever age or name:Rome's Pontiff and the ruling Elders spare;To blacken Albion's Bishops, be thy care:Tell how that realm is by the Bishops curs'd;All discord, error, by their canons nurs'd:New schemes of government unheard-of raise;And all (but that which you live under) praise:For mad Republics still thy strains pursue;For mad Republics, whether old or new,All cursed Monarchies alike decry,Mix'd, absolute, their various rights deny:Monarchs as Tyrants in thy books display;Bishops as feller Tyrants far than they:False are our hopes, and profitless our pains,While Bishops mitres wear, and Anna reigns."D. "It shall be done: great Enemy of light!I bear them all with thee an equal spite:An equal spite, though not a power, I bringWith thee, 'gainst Heaven's all-ruling tyrant King.I hate his Son, as much as you, or more."S. "Why wilt thou thus aloft unbounded soar?Stoop, stoop thy wings; on earth again descend."D. "At thy monition, downwards thus I bend;And only wish—His Church on earth may end!Oh, were my will but once Britannia's Law!Rome should again the servile nation awe;The Druids else regain their lost abodes,And Thor and Woden be Britannia's Gods:Idols in every temple should be found,The poor in chains of Superstition bound;The rich in Luxury and Atheism drown'd:All Decency and Order should be damn'd;And wild Enthusiasm run bellowing through the land.All, in their turns, be Prophets, Priests, and Kings;Distinctions are but meer fantastic things:All Government does from the people flow;Whom they make Priests or Kings, are truly so.These are the doctrines in the Rights I teach,No matter what the Prophets or Apostles preach."S. "Moses indeed (a wonder-working Jew)Tells you, how Empire first in Eden grew;That Adam was the first undoubted King,And from his loins all future Monarchs spring:All egal power on earth with him began,And through his veins to his first-born it ran:God made the Monarch when he made the Man.The Patriarchs hence their right imperial claim'd;And the first son the successor was nam'd:The People never gave Dominion birth;As well might crowns like mushrooms spring from earth:Notions, I own, that have been reckon'd good,But wondrous old—I think—before the flood.Dry; hard to swallow: some of narrower throatsDoubt, or deny, and think this Rabbi doats;So comment all the text away with notes.Next, He of Nazareth, the Prophet, came(To me and thee Tindal, bad as he was, is surely delineated here in terms of exaggeration.

"He first, then they, those slavish doctrines taught,That no revenge must on your foes be wrought;That crowns celestial were to cowards given;And only slaves on earth were lords in heaven:Doctrines, too low for thy erected race!Reject them then, sublimer far embrace;Submission does thy manly tribe disgrace.Do thou thy native fierceness bravely show;Rather than pardon, give the foremost blow:Forgiveness is the coward's want of skill,Or strength to execute his angry will;Or else revenge delayed, till time matureSucceed the vengeance, make resentment sure.Thou on thy foes with speed and vigour fly;And every bold offender, let him die:Stay not till he thy pardon may implore;Or, if he does, let that incense thee more;It shews a coward; and a coward's blowDeserves the utmost that thy rage can do:Thy humour be thy law, thy lust thy guide;Nor subject be to any thing beside,But obstinacy, vanity, and pride.In truths like these the hardy Britons train;Thus subjects wise their liberties maintain;And thus Rebellion will securely reign.Subjects like these their trembling rulers awe;Thus Kings receive, the People give, the law.If any saucy Monarch dare oppose,Or pedant Bishop, let them feel their foes;To death or exile quick the traitors drive;No Rebels to the People ought to live.Thus LaudThe great archbishop, and his royal master.

JACOB BOBARTBotany Professor to the University of Oxford, and Keeper of the Physic Garden; both which offices appear to have been enjoyed by his father, who was the first Keeper of the Physic Garden, wrote a volume of the
"Plantarum Historia universalis Oxoniensis, seu Herbarum Distributio nova,"
and was to have added a third volume on trees, but died in 1679. The first volume of that work was compiled by Dr. Robert Morrison, a native of Aberdeen, who, quitting Scotland in the troubles, studied at Paris, took a degree in physic at Angers, directed the royal gardens at Blois till the death of the duke of Orleans; at the Restoration he was appointed overseer of the king's gardens, fellow of the College of Physicians, and in 1669 professor of Botany in the University of Oxford, where he read lectures till he set about publishing the "Universal Knowledge of Simples." Wood's Fasti, II. 178. Edmund Gayton, the Poetaster, wrote a poem on Mr. Jacob Bobart's
"Yeomen of the Guards to the Physic Garden, to the tune of the Counter Scuffle; Oxford, 1662."
See "British Topography," I. 137. II. 137, 138. The younger Bobart (who was an old man in 1713) collected a Hortus Siccus in twenty volumes. See this Epistle, p. 158. N., 1713.BY DR.

"Gloriae Dei optimi Maximi, Honori Caroli I. Regis, in usum Academiae & Reipublicae, Henricus Comes Danby, anno 1632."
The Earl also settled an annual revenue for the maintenance of the Garden, and for supplying it with plants and herbs, with which it is well stocked. Dr. Sherrard, who was Consul at Smyrna, brought from thence a fine collection of exotics, built a library here, furnished it with botanical books, and augmented the professorship. The noble founder of the garden was created by king James I. baron Danvers of Dantsey; and by king Charles I. earl of Danby, and made a knight of the Bath. Dying unmarried, Jan. 20, 1643, the title became extinct; but was revived, in 1674, in the family of the duke of Leeds.

I. p. 145. I did not then know that he had published a collection of his poems, under the title of
"The Ramble, an Anti-heroick Poem, together with some Terrestrial Hymns and Carnal Ejaculations, by Alexander Radcliffe, of Grays Inn, Esq. 1682,"
8vo; inscribed to James Lord Annesley. He had published in 1680
"Ovid Travestie, a Burlesque upon Ovid's Epistles;"
with a satirical introduction occasioned by the "Preface to a late-Book, called The Wits paraphrased." Mr. Tonson printed a third edition of this Travestie in 1696. The Dedication "To Robert Fairbeard, of Grays Inn, Esq." is no bad specimen of the author's humour. "Having committed these Epistles to the Press, I was horribly put to it for a Patron. I thought of some great Lord, or some angelic Lady; but then again considered I should never be able to adorn my Dedication with benign beams, corruscant rays, and the Devil and all of influence. At last I heard my good friend Mr. Fairbeard was come to town—nay then—all's well enough. To you therefore I offer this English Ovid, to whom you may not be unaptly compared in several parcels of your life and conversation, only with this exception, that you have nothing of his Tristibus. 'Tis you who burlesque all the foppery and conceited gravity of the age. I remember you once told a grave and affected Advocate, 'that he burlesqued God's image, for God had made him after his own likeness, but he made himself look like an ass.' Upon the whole matter I am very well satisfied in my choice of you for a judge; if you speak well of the book, 'tis all I desire, and the bookseller will have reason to rejoice: though by your approbation you may draw upon yourself a grand inconvenience; for perhaps you may too often have songs, sonnets, madrigals, and an innumerable army of stanzas obtruded upon you by, Sir, Your humble servant, ALEX. RADCLIFFE."Amongst his other poems, is a facetious one
"On the Memory of Mr. John Sprat, late Steward of Grays Inn;"
another,
"On the Death of Edward Story, Esq. Master of the Pond, and Principal of Bernard's Inn;"
and,
"The Sword's Farewell upon the Approach of Michaelmas-term."

YALDENOf this writer's life, Dr. Johnson's elegant little composition supersedes what otherwise might have been said. Yalden's "Hymn to Darkness" is "his best performance," being
"for the most part imagined with great vigour, and expressed with great propriety. Of his other poems it is sufficient to say that they deserve perusal, though they are not always exactly polished."
I the rather cite this testimony of the great Biographer, as the publishers of the English Poets have been censured for admitting Yalden into their collection; a censure which, if deserved, I must take upon myself. However it happened that this writer's poems had never been before collected, I am persuaded that there are few who have actually read them but must have sound much to admire. In the "English Poets" I inserted as many of them as could then be met with. Farther researches have discovered what are here printed: but there are still four poems (which are known to be Dr. Yalden's, two of which are particularly noticed in Dr. Johnson's life of him) which have eluded my inquiries; "The Conquest of Namur, 1695," folio;
"The Temple of Fame, to the Memory of the Duke of Gloucester 170,"
folio; "Aesop at Court;" and a poem
"on the late Queen's accession,"
I suppose Queen Anne; which, by the title of it, seems not to have been published till after her death. N., 1697.WHEN black with shades this mourning vault appears,And the relenting marble flows with tears;Think then what griefs a parent's bosom wound,Whose fatal loss enrich'd this hallow'd ground.Strow lilies here, and myrtle wreaths prepare,To crown the fading triumphs of the fair:Here blooming youth and charming beauties lie,Till Earth resigns them to their native sky;Like china laid for ages to refine,And make her body, like the soul, divine.Unmingled may the fragrant-dust remain,No common earth the sacred sweets prophane;But let her urn preserve its virgin store,Chaste and unsully'd as she liv'd before!TO MYRA; WRITTEN IN HER CLEOPATRA.BY DR. YALDEN.HERE, lovely Myra, you beholdThe wonders Beauty wrought of old:In every mournful page appearsThe nymph's disdain, and lover's tears.Whilst these feign'd tragic tales you view,Fondly you weep, and think them true;Lament the hero's slighted flame,Yet praise the fair ungrateful dame.For youths unknown no longer grieve,But rather heal the wounds you give;The slaves your eyes have ruin'd mourn,And pity flames with which your lovers burn.Oh, hadst thou liv'd in former days,Thus Fame had sung lov'd Myra's praise:The triumphs of thy haughty reign,Thy matchless form and cold disdain:Thy beauties had remain'd as longThe theme of every poet's song:Then Myra's conquests had been wrote,And Cleopatra died forgot.ADVICE TO A LOVER.BY THE SAME.FOR many unsuccessful years,At Cynthia's feet I lay;Battering them often with my tears;I sigh'd, but durst not pray.No prostrate wretch, before the shrineOf some loved Saint above,Ere thought his goddess more divine,Or paid more awful love.Still the disdainful nymph look'd downWith coy insulting pride;Receiv'd my passion with a frown,Or turn'd her head aside.Then Cupid whisper'd in my ear," Use more prevailing charms;You modest whining fool, draw near,And clasp her in your arms.With eager kisses tempt the maid,From Cynthia's feet depart;The lips he briskly must invade,That would possess the heart."With that I shook off all the slave,My better fortunes tried;When Cynthia in a moment gaveWhat she for years denied.TO THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON, ON HIS ESSAY ON TRANSLATED VERSE,BY DR. CHETWOODOf whom see vol. I. p. 29, where
"about the same time was made chaplain,"
&c. should have been placed earlier in order of time; as it is properly done in the same volume, p. 70. — Dr. Chetwood, who was an early member of the Society of Antiquaries, had collected materials for a life of Lord Roscommon. He published a
"Speech in the Lower House of Convocation, May 20, 1715, against the late Riots."
His son (who pursued fruitlestly the claim for an English barony) died, at an advanced age, Feb. 17, 1752. N.,AS when by labouring stars new kingdoms riseThe mighty mass in rude confusion lies,A court unform'd, disorder at the bar,And ev'n in peace the rugged mien of war,Till some wise statesman into method drawsThe parts, and animates the frame with laws;Such was the case when Chaucer's early toilFounded the Muses' empire in our soil.Spenser improved it with his painful hand,But lost a noble Muse in Fairy-land.Shakspeare said all that Nature could impart,And Jonson added Industry and Art.Cowley and Denham gain'd immortal praise;And some, who merit as they wear the bays,Search'd all the treasuries of Greece and Rome,And brought the precious spoils in triumph home.But still our language had some ancient rust;Our flights were often high, but seldom just.There wanted one, who license could restrain,Make civil laws o'er barbarous usage reign:One worthy in Apollo's chair to sit,To hold the scales, and give the stamp of wit;In whom ripe judgement and young fancy meet,And force poetic rage to be discreet;Who grows not nauseous while he strives to please,But marks the shelves in the poetic seas.Who knows; and teaches what our clime can bearAnd makes the barren ground obey the labourer's care.Few could conceive, none the great work could do,'Tis a fresh province, and reserv'd for you.Those talents all are yours, of which but oneWere a fair fortune for a Muse's son.Wit, reading, judgement, conversation, art,A head well-balanc'd, and a generous heart.While insect rhymes cloud the polluted sky,Created to molest the world, and die.Your file does polish what your fancy cast;Works are long forming which must always last.Rough iron sense, and stubborn to the mold,Touch'd by your chemic hand, is turn'd to gold,A secret grace fashions the flowing lines,And inspiration through the labour shines.Writers, in spight of all their paint and art,Betray the darling passion of their heart.No fame you wound, give no chaste ears offence,Still true to friendship, modesty, and sense.So Saints, from Heaven for our example sent,Live to their rules, have nothing to repent.Horace, if living, by exchange of fate,Would give no laws, but only yours translate.Hoist sail, bold writers, search, discover far,You have a compass for a Polar-star.Tune Orpheus' harp, and with enchanting rhymesSoften the savage humour of the times.Tell all those untouch'd wonders which appear'dWhen Fate itself for our great Monarch fear'd:Securely through the dangerous forest ledBy guards of Angels when his own were fled.Heaven kindly exercis'd his youth with caresTo crown with unmix'd joys his riper years.Make warlike James's peaceful virtues known,The second hope and genius of the throne.Heaven in compassion brought him on our stage,To tame the fury of a monstrous age.But what blest voice shall your MariaSee the following poem, on her marriage. N. sing?Or a fit offering to her altars bring?In joys, in grief, in triumphs, in retreat,Great always, without aiming to be great.True Roman majesty adorns her face;And every gesture 's form'd by every Grace.Her beauties are too heavenly and refin'dFor the gross senses of a vulgar mind.It is your part (you Poets can divine)To prophesy how she by Heaven's designShall give an heir to the great British line,Who over all the Western isles shall reign,Both awe the continent, and rule the main.It is your place to wait upon her nameThrough the vast regions of eternal fame.True Poets souls to Princes are ally'd,And the world's Empire with its Kings divide.Heaven trusts the present time to Monarch's care,Eternity is the good Writer's shareThese verses of Dr. Chetwood were prefixed to Lord Roscommon's Essay in 1684; with others by Mr. Dryden (see English Poets, vol. XIV. p. 127.) and Mr. Amherst, and Latin verses by Dr. Chetwood (see Gent. Mag. for October 1779) and Mr. C. Dryden. N..ON THE MARRIAGE OF THE LADY MARY WITH THE PRINCE OF ORANGE.BY DR. CHETWOOD.LET fond geographers now seek no moreTheir happy ifles near the scorch'd Libyan shore;Nor in th' Atlantic fix those blissful plains,Where too much sun, and Spanish avarice reigns:These are the climates favoured by Fate,The happy soils, the Islands Fortunate;Their sea from Europe's tumults them divides,And joins them to 't in every thing besides.Peace with her train hath here her palace chose,Riches and pleasure, learning and repose:Here Charles, like Jove on his Olympus, stands,Balancing empires in his mighty hands;And over kings by peaceful arts does findThe best command, the empire of the mind.Here gallant Orange, tir'd with warlike sweat,Lays down his helmet, and seeks soft retreat;Rides o'er the peaceful plains, views rural toil,Sees no slain ploughman here manure the soil:For noisy camps he hears soft music's charms,His doubtful sleep not broke by short alarms:The hero thus secure, love does surprize,Lying in ambush in the Princess' eyes.Love! the frail part in souls the most divine,Whom cautious nature, when she does designImpregnable on every part beside,Like engineers, leaves this unfortify'd:On his free soul it does so fast advance,That it's more dreadful than the power of France:Yet to his enemy he scorns to yield,Like Diomede would meet him in the field.But fight not, Prince, against the Powers divine,Nor at the golden happy shafts repine,For ten days siege, a maiden Helen's thine.For Charles the good, and the illustrious James,Observe their souls burning with mutual flames;Souls which a real sympathy do prove,Souls unison! answering each other's love:Then to him thus they spake—" Brave Prince! whose virtues leave thy years behind,And merits fortune, greater yet design'dBy Heaven! whose youth such high exploits did grace,As prov'd thee of triumphant Nassau's race,Nor sham'st our royal blood that 's in thy veins;Reap here the harvest of your glorious pains:As your reward, we to you do resignOur eldest comfort, to be henceforth thine;And know, that great Elizabeth, when sheFrom Spanish yoke did set your country free,Gave you not half so much—"Now, painful Hollanders, you who extendYour voyages unto the Ocean's end,Whose inexhausted treasuries do holdThe Eastern spices, and the Western gold:Speak, if you ever such a cargo brought,Ever receiv'd a fleet so richly fraught,As this, which brings your Princess to your shore?Confess your Bank, compar'd with this, is poor.Ev'n we (so rich) should so much beauty fearT' export, but that she leaves her sister here.Make a continual day with joyous flames,Join with your fleets your Texel to our Thames;With more pomp to receive this gift of Fate,The fair Palladium of your tottering state.And you, great Princess, fear not the rough main;He knows his duty to his Sovereign,His Nereids will all be of your train.So Venus, when she does to Paphos rideIn her smooth shell, and cuts the gentle tide,Her nymphs make a long row of goodly pride.Now Flanders, more belov'd by Mars than Thrace,Shall at your sight resume her ancient face:The restor'd shepherds shall pipe forth your praise,Call you their Pales in their rural lays;The fearless ploughmen shall you loudly sing,And, as to Ceres, their fruit-offerings bring.The peaceful seas shall break their diguesThe French word for dikes. N. no more,With humble reverence, but salute the shore:When you (as Halcyons) breed, all storms shall cease,Europe enjoy an universal peace.ON THE FIRST FIT OF THE GOUT.WElcome, thou friendly earnest of fourscore,Promise of wealth, that hast alone the powerT' attend the rich, unenvy'd by the poor.Thou that dost Aesculapius deride,And o'er his gally-pots in triumph ride;Thou that art us'd t' attend the royal throne,And under-prop the head that bears the crown;Thou that dost oft in privy council wait,And guard from drowzy sleep the eyes of state;Thou that upon the bench art mounted high,And warn'st the judges how they tread awry;Thou that dost oft from pamper'd prelate's toeEmphatically urge the pains below;Thou that art ever half the city's grace,And add'st to solemn noddles solemn pace;Thou that art us'd to sit on ladies knee,To feed on jellies, and to drink cold tea;Thou that art ne'er from velvet slipper free;Whence comes this unsought honour unto me?Whence does this mighty condescension flow?To visit my poor tabernacle, O—!As Jove vouchsaf'd on Ida's top, 'tis said,At poor Philemon's cot to take a bed;Pleas'd with the poor but hospitable feast,Jove bid him ask, and granted his request;So do thou grant (for thou 'rt of race divine,Begot on Venus, by the God of Wine)My humble suit!—And either give me storeTo entertain thee, or ne'er see me moreThis humourous poem is probably Dr. Chetwood's. See the following Epistle of Dr. Waldren. N..TO DR. CHETWOOD, WHEN HE HAD THE GOUT.BY DR. WALDRENDescended from an antient family, and born at Exeter, where he received the early part of his education. He was admitted a scholar of Exeter College, Oxford, and afterwards removed to All Souls; where he applied to the study of physic, which he afterwards practised with good reputation at Exeter. On the death of Dr. Leopol-William Finch, warden of All Souls College, he was invited in 1702 to succeed to that headship; but contracted such an indisposition by the journey as occasioned his death in a few days. He was buried in the outward chapel belonging to that society. Jacob says,
"he was a well-bred, genteel man, most agreeable in conversation, very polite in his compositions, and peculiarly happy in the expressiion of his thoughts. The West-country gentlemen mention him with very great esteem, and his name and character are very much respected in the University."

WALDREN TO DR. CHETWOOD, ON HIS REFUSING TO TAKE THE OATHS.MOST PROFOUND,SINCE at a tavern I can't meet you,In paper embassy I greet you;T' advise you not to be so wary,Touching King William and Queen Mary;That, spight of fellowship and pupils,You 'll weigh your conscience out in scruples.If (as ye Queen's-men must believe)Two negs make one affirmative;Why i'th name o' th' predicaments,And all your analytic sense,Will you deny two affirmationsIn their turn too to make negations?This postulatum any pateWill grant that 's unprejudicate;Nay th' argument, I will assure you,To some appears à fortiori.Hoc dato et concesso, thus IIn baralypton blunderbuss ye:He that to two kings takes an oathIs by the last absolv'd from both;For, each oath being an affirmation,Both (as was own'd) make a negation.Thus, scientifically, you see,The more you 're bound, the more you 're free;As jugglers, when they knit one more,Undo the knot they ty'd before.I admire that your Smiglecian under--standing should make so strange a blunder,As roundly to aver subjectionWere n't couzen-german to protection:Nay more, they 're relatives (unless yeMistake Tom Hobbes) secundum esse—But I'm in hope you 've slily takenThe oath elsewhere, to save your bacon:As spark, by country-clap half undone,Takes coach, and steals a cure at London.TO CELIA.BY DR. WALDREN.FIE, Celia, 'tis silly to sigh thus in vain,'Tis silly to pity a lover you 've slain:If still you continue your slaves to deride,The pity you feign will be taken for pride.And sorrow for sin can never be true,In one who loves daily to act it anew:For if, whilst you 're fair, you resolve to be coy,You may hourly repent, and hourly destroy.Yet none will believe you, protest what you will,That you grieve for the dead, if the living you kill.Where then are our hopes, when we zealously woo,If you vow to abhor what you constantly do?Then, Celia, be kinder, and tell me my fate,For the worst I can suffer 's to die by your hate:If this you design, ne'er fancy in vainBy your sighs and your tears to recall me again;Nor weep at my grave, for I swear, if you do,As you now laugh at me, I'll then laugh at you.AN ESSAY UPON DEATH,BY DR. WALDREN.TELL me, some kind spirit, tellHow came Death so terrible!Thou who 'rt already fled in triumph, say,Why the embody'd soul is so in love with clay?By what strange magnetism woo'd,She so adheres to flesh and blood,That Fate must force her from her dark abode;Or she would groveling lieTh' eternal tenant of mortality.The wretch, whom a malignant fever fires,Who at each pore in liquid flames expires,Cold Death's refreshing hands to shun,Does to th' unkinder Doctor run,For juleps, blisters, and phlebotomy;The fever's vanquish'd, and the man is free:Yet all this torment only gainsThe privilege of being rack'd again with these,Or the severer painsOf some more merciless disease.Had not the patient better sought a silent tomb,Th' assistance which distempers give, but where they never come?Old age, which one would guessShould with a kind of lustLie down and sleep in dust,Does yet the grand fatigue of life caress;And gapes for its last dregs with inextinguishable thirst:When the gay fire of the dull eye is lostLike cooling metals fix'd by winter's frost,When the bald head, depopulate and bare,Looks smooth as a white globe of ice,Depriv'd of its once-flourishing spring the hair;All that remains will not sufficeThe mighty sum to count,To which the numerous years that have gone o'er amount.Yet ev'n this feeble piece(Now but the monument of what he was)Does with his cordials and elixirs treat,To make his weary pulses beatWith momentary heat:Still he abhors the dismal thought of Death,Still on his guard he stands,Would fain defend his faultering breath,Against the conqueror's stroke, with crutches in his hands.Strange riddle of a mystical desire!That man should wish his vital fireMight vestal prove, and ne'er expire;That he should hope that his eclipsed beams,Like Arethusa, under ground, might stray,And never disembogue their shining streamsInto the glorious ocean of inexhausted day!Is this the cause we so much boastOur reason as a sure unerring guide(No less our safety than our pride)?And would it have us in a tempest ride,In which we are for ever lost?When one kind shipwreck would convey us safeBack to our native coast;A coast where we may pleasures taste,High with the gust of perils past;Where a perpetual spring of bliss,Blooming in all the rich luxuriancesOf never-fading extasies,Satiates, but does not cloy,The ravish'd mind;Where no tears fall but those of joy,Which, Nilus-like, when they o'er-flow, are kind.But though with all this pomp of words we prate,And paint our happy future state;Yet sure we think them pageantries of a distemper'd head,Which Fancy's pencil did delineate;The broken visions of the living, when they dream they 're dead.That we 're so loth to die,Proceeds from Infidelity:For whatsoe'er the sturdy men of sense,Those sculls of Axiom and Philosophy,By Reason's telescope pretend t' evince;Beyond this world there can no other beWorse than this life, when it appearsIn all its hurricanes of hopes and fears.So some baulk'd gamester, that has only one poor stake,And knows not when he shall get more to keep in play,Does his last chance with trembling take,And would the fatal throw delay;The box once cast, to him for ever 's cast away.Or, if we 're truly satisfy'd,The soul is to Divinity ally'd;That its impenetrable hypostasisIs of a lasting and substantial make,Which Death's arrest can never shake;But sprinkled ashes shall arise,Kindled with an exalted energy:If this our firm persuasion be,Doubtless 'tis guilt which makes us groan,When Fate sends forth the black decreeOf dissolution:As a debauch'd gallant,Who 's just embarking for a foreign land,Amidst a rout of creditors does trembling stand,Who for quick payment with wild fury rant;Th' unhappy wretch can't find a bail,And thus his journey 's finish'd in a gaol;So Conscience rallies-upOf crimes, the worst of debts, ten thousand bills,Embitters with new poison Death's ungrateful cup,And the departing soul with horror fills.Thus wretched mortals lieUnder a bad necessityOf strong desire to live, and stronger fear to die.Which way soe'er they turn,A forcible dilemma's hornWounds them in each hypothesis:The Atheist would for ever live in this,If there 's no other world; the Theist, if there is.SONG, MADE FOR A WEDDING.BY DR. WALDREN.LET Hymen on this happy day,The brightest which e'er grac'd the year,Transport in every face display,Since Heaven and Marriage come so near.A matchless pair before him bows,To ask his seals which ever bind;He cannot but approve the vowsOf two so beauteous, two so kind.The Godhead smiles: then, then we knowWhat the effects of marriage prove;That joys in endless rounds shall flow,And life be one long scene of love.EPIGRAM ON A PIGMY'S DEATH.BY DR. SPRAT; NOT IN HIS WORKS.BESTRIDE an ant a pigmy great and tallWas thrown, alas! and got a deadly fall;Under th' unruly beast's proud feet he lies,All torn; but yet with generous ardour cries," Behold, base, envious world, now, now laugh on:For thus I fall, and thus fell Phaeton."MARVEL'S GHOST.BY CAPTAIN JOHN AYLOFFEThis gentleman, who was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, was a man of wit and humour; which carried his inclinations to poetry. He published, Jacob says, several valuable small pieces; among which, "Marvel's Ghost" is very much admired. In the third volume of
"Dryden's Miscellanies"
is a poem
"On the Death of K. Charles II. and the Accession of K. James II. to the Throne,"
by Mr William Ayloffe, which is tolerably harmonious, but too fulsomely flattering to deserve preservation. N..FROM the dark Stygian lake I come,To acquaint poor England with her doom;Which, by the Infernal Sisters late,I copied from the book of Fate:And though the sense may seem disguis'd,'Tis in these following lines compriz'd:" When England shall forsake the Broom,And take the Thistle in the room;A wanton fiddler shall be ledBy fate to shame his master's bed;From whence a spurious race shall grow,Design'd for Britain's overthrow.These, whilst they do possess her throne,Shall serve all interests but their own;And shall be, both in peace and war,Scourges unto themselves and her.A brace of exil'd youths, whose fatesShall pull down vengeance on those statesThat harbour'd them abroad, must comeWell skill'd in foreign vices home,And shall, their dark designs to hide,With two contesting Churches side,Till, with cross persecuting zeal,They have destroy'd the Commonweal:Then incest, murder, perjury,Shall fashionable virtues be;And villainies infest this isle,Shall make the son of Claudius smile:No oaths or sacraments hold good,But what are seal'd with lust and blood:Lust, which cold exile could not tame,Nor plague nor fire at home reclaim:For this she shall in ashes mourn,From Europe's envy turn her scorn,And curse the day that e'er gave birthTo Cecil, or to Monk, on earth."But, as I onwards strove to look,The angry Sister shut the book,And said, "No more; that fickle StateShall know no further of her fate;Her future fortunes must be hidTill her known ills be remedied;And she to those resentments come,That drove the Tarquins out of Rome;Or such as did in fury turnTh' Assyrian's palace to his urn."ON THE CAMBRIDGE COMMENCEMENT.BY CAPTAIN AYLOFFE.HE that first said it, knew the worth of wit,Lov'd well his glass, and as he drank he writ;Vast was his soul, and sparkling was the wine,Which strangely did inspire each mighty line.The watery springs of Helicon are themesFit for dull freshmen, and dull doctors dreams;Not flood of Cam, or well of Aristotle,Yield half the pleasure of the charming bottle;Poor scribblers then, that bread and water use,The slender diet of a Bridewell Muse,As easily may Water Poets make,As Coffee Politicians does createThe two grand Whigs of Poetry and State.When booths on Thames were built, and oxen roasted,Poets the strength of Waters might have boasted;And might have made their frozen verse to pass,As well as he that put-out Ice for Glass:Though our good Proctor otherwise does think,Our Mother Cambridge kindly bids us drink;She holds the candle and the sacred cup,And, as one wasteth, cries, "Drink t' other up."'Twas drinking got our ancestors renown,And claret first that dyed the scarlet gown.As well may Dutchmen without brandy fight,As English Poets without Claret write.Not moderate learning, nor immoderate fees,Are of themselves sufficient for degrees:Wine and the supper must the act compleat;And he does best dispute, who best does treat:'Tis Carnival, and we'll the time enjoy,This day and next, while wine and wit run high.—And, in the forty days,Preachers in vain may bid the Court repent,But Poets sure did never write in Lent.Now, in the name of dulness and small-beer,Ye Northern Wits of fam'd St. John's appear,That scarce taste wine or wit throughout the year.Had she, who by the powerful charms of wineTransform'd Ulysses men to gruntling swine;Had she, and you th' experiment tried again,By contrary effects ye had Poets been.Next, the pert fops by title dignified,Wise to themselves, and fools to all beside,Whom company nor drinking can refine,Blockish and dull beyond the power of wine;Who, after the first bottle still the same,Can never higher rise than Anagram,Or at most quibble on their Dowdy's name.When Whig religious, Trimmer loyal turns,When Cambridge wives and Barnwell whores turn nuns,When curate 's rich, and the fat doctor's poor;When scholars tick, and townsmen cheat no more;When amorous fops leave hunting handsome faces,When craving beadle begs no more for places;Hopkins and Sternhold, with their paltry rhymes,Shall please us now, and take with future times:And water-drinkers then shall famous grow;Settle, the Poet to my Lord-mayor's show,Shall Dryden, Cowley, and our Duke, outgo.WRITTEN IN A LADY'S WALLER.THE lovely owner of this bookDoes here on her own image look:Each happy page, each finish'd line,Does with her matchless graces shine;And is, with common verse compar'd,What she is among Beauty's herd.The Poet boasts a lofty thought,In softest numbers smoothly wrought;Has all that pleases the severe,And all that charms a listening ear.And such the nymph is—blest with allThat we can sweet or noble call:For never sure was any mind,Of all that from Heaven's treasury came,Of better make and more refin'd,Or lodg'd within a fairer frame.Such angels seem, when pleas'd to wearSome lovely dress of colour'd air!Oh, had she liv'd before the oldBard had so many winters told:Then when his youthful veins ran high,Enflam'd with Love and Poetry:He only to this shining maidThe tribute of his verse had paid:No meaner face, no lesser name,Had fix'd his eyes, or fed his flame;Her beauties had employ'd his tongue,And Sacharissa died unsung.SONG.YOU say, you love! repeat again,Repeat th' amazing sound;Repeat the ease of all my pain,The cure of every wound.What you to thousands have deny'd,To me you freely give;Whilst I in humble silence dy'd,Your mercy bid me live.So on cold Latmos' top each nightEndymion sighing lay,Gaz'd on the Moon's transcendent light,Despair'd, and durst not pray.But divine Cynthia saw his grief,Th' effect of conquering charms;Unask'd, the Goddess brings relief,And falls into his arms.ANACREON IMITATED.OFT the reverend dotards cry," Why so loving, Daphnis, why?Love 's a thing for age alone:Love 's a God, and you 're too young.Let the harvest crown your brow,And adorn your head with snow;Love may boldly enter then:Years will countenance your flame.Fruits, unripe, disgust the taste;Falling ripe they please us best.Colts are skittish; but the dam(Once a colt) is still and tame."Reverend dotards, why so wise?Why these reverend fooleries!Who neglects to back the horse,Till his years compute him worse?Generous brutes, that latest die,Early to enjoyment fly:Vigorous nature scorns a tye.Gather'd fruits are best of all;We despise them when they fall.Thus your follies shew to me,What my reverend age shall be.Bring the glass then, bring the fair,Fill it, 'tis a health to her.For experimental IWill a great example be,To convince such reverend foolsOf their own mistaken rules.ANACREON IMITATED.OH, how pleasant is 't! how sweet!While with beauties exquisiteNature paints the fragrant grove,Thus to walk and talk of love!Here no envious Eastern galeSells us pleasure by retail.Western breezes here dispenseJoys so full, they cloy the sense.Gods! oh Gods! how sweet a shadeHas that honey-suckle made!Clasping round that spreading tree,Clasping fast, and apeing me,Me who, there with Celia laid,First inform'd the lovely maidSo to clasp and so to twine.Oh! how sweet a life is mine!ANACREON IMITATED.COME fill 't up, and fill it high,The barren earth is always dry;But, well steep'd in kindly showers,It laughs in dew, and smiles in flowers.The jovial Gods did, sure, design,By the immortal gift of wine,To drown our sighs, and ease our care,And make 's content to revel here;To revel, and to reign in love,And be throughout like those above.PALLAS.PALLAS, destructive to the Trojan line,Raz'd their proud walls, though built with hands divine;But Love's bright Goddess, with propitious grace,Preserv'd a hero to restore the race:So the fam'd empire, where the Iber flows,Fell by Eliza, and by Anna rose.PART OF VIRGIL'S FIRST GEORGICK,TRANSLATED BY HENRY SACHEVERELLThe history of this man affords a very striking example of the folly and madness of party, which could exalt an obscure individual, possessed of but moderate talents, to an height of popularity that the present times behold with wonder and astonishment. He was the son of Joshua Sacheverell of Marlborough clerk (who died minister of St. Peter's Church in Marlborough, leaving a numerous family in very low circumstances). Henry was put to school at Marlborough, at the charge of Mr. Edward Hearst, an apothecary, who, being his godfather, adopted him as his son, Hearst's widow put him afterwards to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he became demy in 1687, at the age of 15. Young Sacheverell soon distinguished himself by a regular observation of the duties of the house, by his compositions, good-manners, and genteel behaviour; qualifications which recommended him to that society, of which he was fellow, and, as public tutor, had the care of the education of most of the young gentlemen of quality and fortune that were admitted of the college. In this station he bred a great many persons eminent for their learning and abilities; and among others was tutor to Mr. Holdsworth, whose "Muscipula" and "Dissertations on Virgil" have been so deservedly esteemed. He was contemporaty and chamber-fellow with Mr. Addison, and one of his chief intimates till the time of his famous trial. Mr. Addison's
"Account of the greatest English Poets,"
dated April 3, 1694, in a Farewell-poem to the Muses on his intending to enter into holy orders, was inscribed "to Mr. Henry Sacheverell," his then dearest friend and colleague. Much has been said by Sacheverell's enemies of his ingratitude to his relations, and of his turbulent behaviour at Oxford; but these appear to have been groundless calumnies, circulated only by the spirit of party. In his younger years he wrote some excellent Latin poems: besides several in the second and third volumes of the "Musae Anglicanae," ascribed to his pupils, there is a good one of some length in the second volume, under his own name (transcribed from the Oxford Collection, on Q. Mary's death, 1695). He took the degree of M.A. May 16, 1696; B.D, Feb. 4, 1707; D.D. July 1, 1708. His first preferment was Cannock, in the county of Stafford. He was appointed preacher of St. Saviour's, Southwark, in 1705; and while in this station preached his famous sermons (at Derby, Aug. 15, 1709; and at St. Paul's, Nov. 5, in the same year); and in one of them was supposed to point at lord Godolphin. under the name of Volpone. It has been suggested, that to this circumstance, as much as to the doctrines contained in his sermons, he was indebted for his prosecution, and eventually for his preferment. Being impeached by the house of commons, his trial began Feb. 27, 1709-10; and continued until the 23d of March: when he was sentenced to a suspension from preaching for three years, and his two sermons ordered to be burnt. This ridiculous prosecution overthrew the ministry, and laid the foundation of his fortune. To Sir Simon Harcourt, who was counsel for him, he presented a silver bason gilt, with an elegant inscription. He very soon after was collated to a living near Shrewsbury; and, in the same month that his suspension ended, had the valuable rectory of St. Andrew Holborn given him by the Queen. At that time his reputation was so high, that he was enabled to sell the first sermon, preached after his sentence expired, for the sum of 100l.; and upwards of 40,000 copies, it is said, were soon fold. We find by Swift's Journal to Stella, Jan. 22, 1711-12, that he had also interest enough with the ministry to provide very amply for one of his brothers; yet, as the Dean had said before, Aug. 24, 1711, "they hated, and affected to despise him." In 1716, he prefixed a dedication to "Fifteen Discourses, occasionally delivered before the University of Oxford, by W. Adams, M.A. late student of Christ Church, and rector of Staunton upon Wye, in Oxfordshire." After this publication, we hear little of him, except by quarrels with his parishioners, although he was much suspected to be concerned in Atterbury's plot. A considerable estate at Callow in Derbyshire was left to him by his kinsman Geo. Sacheverell, esq. He died June 5, 1724; and, by his will, bequeathed to Bishop Atterbury, then in exile, who was supposed to have penned his defence for him, the sum of 500l. By a letter to him from his uncle, 1711, it appears, that he had a brother named Thomas, and a sister Susannah. — The dutchess of Marlborough describes him as
"an ignorant impudent incendiary; a man who was the scorn even of those who made use of him as a tool."
Account, &c. p. 247. — And Bp. Burnet says,
"He was a bold insolent man, with a very small measure of religion, virtue, learning, or good sense; but he resolved to force himself into popularity and preferment, by the most petulant railings at Dissenters and Low-church men, in several sermons and libels, wrote without either chasteness of style, or liveliness of expression."
History, vol. II. p. 277. N..DEDICATED TO MR. DRYDEN.FIRST let thy altars smoke with sacred fire,Thy early labours the just Gods require.Let Ceres' blessings usher-in the year,To give an omen to thy future care.With sacrifice adorn her grassy shrine,With milk, with honey, and with flowing wine.Then go, the mighty Goddess to adore,When Spring buds forth, and Winter is no more.Then well-fed lambs thy plenteous tables load,And mellow wines give appetite to food.Whilst the cool shade by small refreshing streamsInvite soft sleep, and gentle pleasing dreams,The rustic youth the Goddess should imploreTo bless their fruits, and to increase their store.Thrice let the sacrifice in triumph ledCrown the new offspring of her fruitful bed.A joyful choir shall sing her praises round,And with unequal motions beat the ground.Whilst oaken branches on their temples twine,To shew the better use of corn and wine.The Goddess, thus appeas'd, will bend her ear,And with a plenteous harvest will reward your care.The certain seasons of the year to knowGreat Jove has taught us, and from whence they flow,Droughts, rains, and winds, their certain signs forego.Those messengers of Fate provide the way,To give the signal of a gloomy day.The moon her tokens constantly fulfils,And with her beams points out th' approaching ills.Her waning orb puts on a various form,To give the sign of an impending storm.When South-winds rise, the herdsmen justly fear,And seek a shelter when the tempest 's near.First from a gentle blast the winds arise,Whose infant voice in whispering murmurs flies,Then with loud clamours fills the troubled skies.By small degrees advanc'd, it stronger grows,Till every point each other does oppose.Then through the jarring zones it frets and roars,And lifts the swelling billows to the shores.Vast watery mountains roll upon the sand,And angry surges beat the trembling land.A harsh, shrill noise the echoing caverns fills,And strikes the ear from the resounding hills;Whose reverend tops, with aged pine-trees crown'd,Rock with the wind, and tremble with the sound.The threatening surges hardly can forbearThe tatter'd vessel, while the seamen fearEach rolling billow should their last appear.The frighten'd native of the troubled wavesHis long-accustom'd habitation leaves.Now born aloft a winged army soar,To seck for safety on a calmer shore.The moor-hen, conscious of the tempest near,Plays on the sand, and so prevents her fear.The hern forsakes his ancient marshy bed,And towers to heaven, while clouds bedew his head;Sometimes he 's met by a descending star,Which warns the tempest rushing from afar.The headlong planet glides in fiery streams,And shoots through darkness with its radiant beams:It cuts the shadows with a train of light,And makes a medley of the day and night.A sportive whirlwind lifts the moving sand,In mystic circles dancing on the land.Now wanton feathers whiten all the flood;And sapless leaves fly o'er the shaken wood,At distance blackening in a dusky cloud.But when a new-fledg'd storm comes blustering forth,And quits the thundering regions of the North:When East and West in distant poles conspire,Uniting rage, to swell the deluge higher,With rapid streams the full-charg'd channels flow,Collecting forces as they farther go.Th' unruly tide no sturdy banks control,O'er unknown plains the furious torrents roll.The reapers mourn, to see the deluge bearThe long-expected labours of the year.SONG.BY SIR JOHN EATON.TELL me not I my time mis-spend,'Tis time lost to reprove me;Pursue thou thine, I have my end,So Chloris only love me.Tell me not other flocks are full,Mine poor; let them despise meWho more abound with milk and wool,So Chloris only prize me.Tire other easier ears with theseUnappurtaining stories;He never felt the world's disease,Who car'd not for its glories.For pity, thou that wiser art,Whose thoughts lie wide of mine;Let me alone with my own heart,And I'll ne'er envy thine.Nor blame him, whoe'er blames my wit,That seeks no higher prize,Than in unenvy'd shades to sit,And sing of Chloris' eyes.SIR JOHN EATON IMITATED,BY JOHN EARL OF ROCHESTERThe poems of this witty but profligate nobleman were very judiciously pruned by Dr. Johnson before their admission into the tenth volume of the English Poets. The Song here preserved, however, is sufficiently exempt from the censure too many of this writer's poems have deserved. In the "Supplement to Swift," I have had occasion to observe, from Mr. Granger, that Rochester had natural modesty. The fact is, he wrote but little of the ribaldry which passes under his name; but, having obtained the character of a lewd writer, every thing in that strain was fathered upon him. "In all his works," Dr. Johnson says,
"there is sprightliness and vigour, and every where may be found tokens of a mind which study might have carried to excellence."
N.,TOO late, alas! I must confessYou need not arts to move me:Such charms by nature you possess,'Twere madness not to love ye.Then spare a heart you may surprize,And give my tongue the gloryTo boast, though my unfaithful eyesBetray a kinder story.THE PASSING-BELL.COME, honest sexton, take thy spade,And let my grave be quickly made:Thou still art ready for the dead,Like a kind host, to make my bed.I now am come to be thy guest,Let me in some dark lodging rest,For I am weary, full of pain,And of my pilgrimage complain.On Heaven's decree I waiting lie,And all my wishes are to die.Hark, I hear my passing-bell,Farewell, my loving friends, farewell!Make my cold bed, good sexton, deep,That my poor bones may safely sleep;Until that sad and joyful day,When from above a voice shall say," Wake, all ye Dead, lift up your eyes," The great Creator bids you rise."Then do I hope, among the just,To shake off this polluted dust;And, with new robes of glory drest,To have access among the blest.Hark, I hear my passing-bell,Farewell, my loving friends farewell!BALLAD ON A NEW OPERA"The Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru; expressed by instrumental and vocal Musick, and by art of Perspective in Scenes, &c. Represented daily at The Cockpit in Drury Lane at three afternoon punctually, 1658."
This Opera may safely be ascribed to Sir William Davenant. It was first acted at the time and place and in the manner before described, and afterwards introduced by the author into "The Playhouse to be let." See a list of his dramatic writings in the new edition of Dodsley's Old Plays, vol. VIII. N.. 1658.NOW Heaven preserve our realm,And him that sits at th' helm.I will tell you of a new storyOf Sir William and his apes,With full many merry japes,Much after the rate of John Dorie.This sight is to be seenNear the street that's call'd the Queen,And the people have call'd it the Opera.But the devil take my wife,If all the days in my lifeI did ever see such a foppery.Where first one beginsWith a trip and a cringe,And a face set in starch to accost 'em,IUsed by Shakspeare and other ancient writers for Aye. N., and with a speech to boot,That had neither head nor foot,Might have serv'd for a Charterhouse rostrum.Oh, he look'd so like a Jew,Would have made a man spew,When he told them here was this, here was that;Just like him that shews the tombs,For when the sum total comes,'Tis two hours of I know not what.Neither must I here forgetThe music, how it was set,Dise two ayers and a half and a JoveTo explain this, the music should be seen and heard. N.:All the rest was such a gig,Like the squeaking of a pig,Or cats when they 're making their love.The next thing was the scene,And that as it was lain,But no man knows where in Peru,With a story for the nonceOf raw head and bloody bones,But the devil a word that was true.There might you have seen an apeWith his fellow for to gape,Now dancing and turning o'er and o'er.What cannot poets do?They can find out in PeruThings no man ever saw before.Then presently the SpaniardStruts with his winyard,Now heaven of thy mercy how grim!Who'd have thought that Christian menWould have eat up children,Had he not seen them do it limb by limb?Oh greater cruelty yet,Like a pig upon a spit,Here lies one, there another boil'd to a jelly;Just so the people stareAt an ox in the fair,Roasted whole, with a pudding in 's belly.I durst have laid my headThat the king there had been dead,When I saw how they basted and carv'd him;Had he not come up againUpon the stage, there to complainHow scurvily the rogues had serv'd him.A little further inHung a third by the chin,And a fourth cut out all in quarters;Oh, that Fox had now been living,They had been sure of Heaven,Or at the least been some of his Martyrs.But, which was strange again,The Indians that they had slainCame dancing all in a troop;But, oh, give me the last,For, as often as he pass'd,He still tumbled like a dog in a hoop.And now, my Signior StruggePerhaps the baboon introduced in this opera. R.,In good faith you may go jogge,For Sir William will have something to brag on;Oh, the English boys are comeWith their fife and their drum,And still the Knight must conquer the Dragon.And so now my story is done,And I'll end as I begun,With a word, and I care not who know it;Heaven keep us, great and small,And bless us some and all,From every such pitiful Poet!THE HYPOCRITE, BY MR. CARYLLOf whom see vol. II. p. 1. N.. ON THE LORD SHAFTESBURY. 1678.THOU 'rt more inconstant than the wind or sea,Or that still veering sex out-done by thee:Reeling from vice to vice, thou hast run throughLegions of sins more than the casuists know:Of whom thy friends were wont to say, "Poor devil!At least he was not constant to his evil!"Dealing so long in sins of pomp and glory,Who would have thought (to make up Guzman's story)Hypocrisy at last should enter in,And fix this floating mercury of sin?All his old sins, like misses out of date,Turn pensioners to this new miss of state:His actions, look, and garb, take a new frame,And wear the livery of this sullen dame:Plain band, and hair, and cloaths, disguise the man,All, but his dealing and his heart, is plain.Not Ovid's stories, nor the wife of Lot,Can boast a change beyond our state-bigot:All on the sudden, in one fatal morn,Our courtier did to a stark Quaker turn.Some thinkHe does, as criminals who would defeatThe course of Justice, madness counterfeit:No, Godliness, that once much-pitied thing,Of his new fiddle is the only string:For the poor Church is all his tender care,And Popery's growth he sounds in every ear;At which the dirty rout run grunting in,As when the old wife's kettle rings the swine.So the court-dame, who in her youthful prideNo pleasure to her craving sense deny'd,But, unreserv'd, with every fresh delight,Did prodigally feast her appetite,Age drawing on, when through her youth's decay,Her servants with her beauty drop away;For winter quarters, she Religion takes,And of necessity a virtue makes.And when the wrinkles of her face no cureWill longer from the help of art endure,Covering the worn-out sinner with the saint,As once her face, she now her soul does paint.Since churches are not, must religion beOf guilty persons still the sanctuary?When great men fall, or popular men would rise,Both from religion borrow their disguise.Then, like Achilles in his fate-proof arms,They boldly march, guided with holy charms,And brow-beat Caesar, and defy his laws;Who dare resist the champion of God's cause?But, when the place or pension is your own,When the opposing party is run down,Religion and God's cause aside are cast,Like actor's habit, when the play is past.This dame Hypocrisy, with sour face,Does fit supply old mother Mosely's place:She for his body did provision find,This caters for the letchery of his mind,And for his vast ambition, and his pride,And his insatiate avarice, does provide;His body thus and soul together vieIn Vice's empire for the sovereignty.In ulcers that, this does abound in sin,Lazar without, and Lucifer within;The silver-pipeAn allusion to a chirurgical instrument. N. is no sufficient drainFor the corruption of this little man;Who, though he ulcers have in every part,Is no where so corrupt as in his heart.ON SEEING A BANK OF PRIMROSES, IN JANUARY, COVERED WITH SNOW.BY MR. THOMAS FOXTONAuthor of
"The Metamorphosis of Mr. Pope into a Stinging-nettle,"
at the end of "The Female Dunciad," 1728; and translator of Burnet's
"Archaeologia Philosophica,"
and his tract
"De futurâ Judaeorum Restauratione."
N..THESE forward roses spread an infant bloom,Lavish at once of beauty and perfume;Their yellow leaves with fragrant pride display,And smile all lovely on the rising day;Ambitious seem to deck some virgin's breast,And there for ever lay their fading sweets to rest.But, cruel chance! keen Eastern gales arise,And drive the Winter through the hazy skies;These pretty flowers can now no longer glow,Pierc'd with the frost, and buried under snow;If still relentless storms persist to beat,And chilling vapours damp the genial heat;There 's no relief, these gaudy sweets must die,And all their pregnant charms in long oblivion lie.But should the sun, in majesty serene,Adorn the grove, and paint the burnish'd green;Each drooping rose its mournful head would rear,Bright as the heavens, and like the morning fair;While purple honours crown the well-distinguish'd year.ON THE CASTLE OF DUBLIN.BY DR. PARNELLThomas Parnell, D.D. descended from an antient family of Congleton in Cheshire, was born in Dublin, in the year 1679; and was admitted a member of Dublin College at the early age of thirteen. He took his degree of M.A. July 9, 1700; and in the same year was ordained a deacon by Dr. William King, then bishop of Derry, having a dispensation from the primate, as being under twenty-three years of age. He was admitted into priests orders about three years after, by Dr. King, then archbishop of Dublin; and was collated by Dr. St. George Ashe, bishop of Clogher, to the archdeaconry of Clogher, Feb. 9, 1705. About that time also he married Miss Anne Minchin, a young lady of great merit and beauty, by whom he had two sons, who died young, and a daughter, living in 1770. Swift, in his Journal to Stella, August 24, 1712, say,
"I am heartily for poor Mrs. Parnell's death: she seemed ro be an excellent good-natured young woman, and I believe the poor lad is much afflicted: they appeared to live perfectly well together."
This event is supposed to have made an indelible impression on his spirits. He was warmly recommended by the Dean to archbishop King: who gave him a prebend in 1713, and the vicarage of Finglas (worth about 400 l. a year) May 31, 1716. His gratitude is beautifully expressed in a poem on the Dean's birth-day, 1713. He died at Chester, in July 1718, on his way to Ireland; and was buried in Trinity church in that town, without any monument to mark the place of his interment. As he left no male issue, his estate devolved to his only nephew, Sir Sir John Parnell, baronet, whose father was younger brother to the archdeacon, and one of the justices of the king's bench in Ireland. The character of Dr. Parnell is admirably pourtrayed by Dr. Goldsmith, in the Life prefixed to a volume of his Poems, originally published by Mr. Pope, in 1721. A posthumous volume was printed at Dublin in 1758. And both these volumes united, with several additional poems which I had formerly collected, are printed in the forty-fourth volume of the "English Poets." N.. 1715.THIS house and inhabitants both well agree,And resemble each other as near as can be;One half is decay'd, and in want of a prop,The other new-built, but not finish'd at top.ON THE DEATH OF MR. VINER.BY DR. PARNELL.IS Viner dead? and shall each Muse becomeSilent as Death, and as his music dumb?Shall he depart without a Poet's praise,Who oft to harmony has tun'd their lays?Shall he, who knew the elegance of sound,Find no one voice to sing him to the ground?Music and Poetry are sister-arts,Shew a like genius, and consenting hearts:My soul with his is secretly ally'd,And I am forc'd to speak, since Viner dy'd.Oh, that my Muse, as once his notes, could swell!That I might all his praises fully tell;That I might say with how much skill he play'd,How nimbly four extended strings survey'd;How bow and fingers, with a noble strife,Did raise the vocal fiddle into life;How various sounds, in various order rang'd,By unobserv'd degrees minutely chang'd,Through a vast space could in divisions run,Be all distinct, yet all agree in one:And how the fleeter notes could swiftly pass,And skip alternately from place to place;The strings could with a sudden impulse bound,Speak every touch, and tremble into sound.The liquid harmony, a tuneful tide,Now seem'd to rage, anon would gently glide;By turns would ebb and flow, would rise and fall,Be loudly daring, or be softly small:While all was blended in one common name,Wave push'd on wave, and all compos'd a stream.The different tones melodiously combin'd,Temper'd with art, in sweet confusion join'd;The soft, the strong, the clear, the shrill, the deep,Would sometimes soar aloft, and sometimes creep;While every soul upon his motions hung,As though it were in tuneful concert strung.His touch did strike the fibres of the heart,And a like trembling secretly impart;Where various passions did by turns succeed,He made it chearful, and he made it bleed;Could wind it up into a glowing fire,Then shift the scene, and teach it to expire.Oft have I seen him, on a public stage,Alone the gaping multitude engage;The eyes and ears of each spectator draw,Command their thoughts, and give their passions law;While other music, in oblivion drown'd,Seem'd a dead pulse, or a neglected sound.Alas! he 's gone, our great Apollo 's dead,And all that's sweet and tuneful with him fled;Hibernia, with one universal cry,Laments the loss, and speaks his elegy.Farewell, thou author of refin'd delight,Too little known, too soon remov'd from sight;Those fingers, which such pleasure did convey,Must now become to stupid worms a prey:Thy grateful fiddle will for ever standA silent mourner for its master's hand:Thy art is only to be match'd above,Where Music reigns, and in that Music Love:Where thou wilt in the happy chorus join,And quickly thy melodious soul refineTo the exalted pitch of Harmony Divine.EPIGRAM.BY DR. PARNELL." Haud facile emergunt, quorum virtutibus obstat" Res angusta domi—"THE greatest gifts that Nature does bestow,Can't unassisted to perfection grow:A scanty fortune clips the wings of Fame,And checks the progress of a rising name:Each dastard virtue drags a captive's chain,And moves but slowly, for it moves with pain:Domestic cares sit hard upon the mind,And cramp those thoughts which should be unconfin'd;The cries of Poverty alarm the soul,Abate its vigour, its designs control:The stings of Want inflict the wounds of Death,And motion always ceases with the breath.The love of friends is found a languid fire,That glares but faintly, and will soon expire;Weak is its force, nor can its warmth be great,A feeble light begets a feeble heat.Wealth is the fuel that must feed the flame,It dies in rags, and scarce deserves a name.LOVE IN DISGUISE.BY DR. PARNELL.TO stifle passion, is no easy thing;A heart in love is always on the wing;The bold betrayer flutters still,And fans the breath prepar'd to tell:It melts the tongue, and tunes the throat,And moves the lips to form the note;And when the speech is lost,It then sends out its ghost,A little sigh,To say we die.'Tis strange the air that cools, a flame should prove;But wonder not, it is the air of love.Yet, Chloris, I can make my love look well,And cover bleeding wounds I can't conceal;My words such artful accents break,You think I rather act than speak:My sighs, enliven'd through a smile,Your unsuspecting thoughts beguile;My eyes are vary'd so,You can't their wishes know:And I'm so gay,You think I play.Happy contrivance! such as can't be priz'd,To live in love, and yet to live disguis'd!CHLORIS APPEARING IN A LOOKING-GLASS.BY DR. PARNELL.OFT have I seen a piece of art,Of light and shade the mixture fine,Speak all the passions of the heart,And shew true life in every line.But what is this before my eyes,With every feature, every grace,That strikes with love and with surprize,And gives me all the vital face?It is not Chloris: for, behold,The shifting phantom comes and goes;And when 'tis here, 'tis pale and cold,Nor any female softness knows.But 'tis her image, for I feelThe very pains that Chloris gives;Her charms are there, I know them well,I see what in my bosom lives.Oh, could I but the picture save!'Tis drawn by her own matchless skill;Nature the lively colours gave,And she need only look to kill.Ah! fair-one, will it not suffice,That I should once your victim lie;Unless you multiply your eyes,And strive to make me doubly die?ON A LADY WITH FOUL BREATH.BY DR. PARNELL.ART thou alive? It cannot be,There 's so much rottenness in thee,Corruption only is in death;And what 's more putrid than thy breath?Think not you live because you speak,For graves such hollow sounds can make;And respiration can't suffice,For vapours do from caverns rise:From thee such noisome stenches come,Thy mouth betrays thy breast a tomb.Thy body is a corpse that goes,By magic rais'd from its repose:A pestilence, that walks by day,But falls at night to worms and clay.But I will to my Chloris run,Who will not let me be undone:The sweets her virgin-breath containsAre fitted to remove my pains;There will I healing nectar sip,And, to be sav'd, approach her lip,Though, if I touch the matchless dame,I 'm sure to burn with inward flame.Thus, when I would one danger shun,I 'm straight upon another thrown:I seek a cure, one sore to ease,Yet in that cure 's a new diseaseBut Love, though fatal, still can bless,And greater dangers hide the less;I 'll go where passion bids me fly,And choose my death, since I must die;As Doves, pursued by birds of prey,Venture with milder man to stay.ON THE NUMBER THREE.BY DR. PARNELL.BEAUTY rests not in one fix'd place,But seems to reign in every face;'Tis nothing sure but fancy then,In various forms, bewitching men;Or is its shape and colour fram'd,Proportion just, and Woman nam'd?If Fancy only rul'd in Love,Why should it then so strongly move?Or why should all that look agree,To own its mighty power in Three?In Three it shews a different face,Each shining with peculiar grace.Kindred a native likeness gives,Which pleases, as in all it lives;And, where the features disagree,We praise the dear variety.Then Beauty surely ne'er was yet,So much unlike itself, and so complete.ESSAY ON THE DIFFERENT STYLES OF POETRYThis and the preceding Poems by Dr. Parnell (as has been already said of Dr. Yalden) were omitted in the former collection only because they could not then be met with. I cannot but take this opportunity of correcting a mistake (which I was led into by Dr. Birch) in the note on the English Poets, vol. XLIV. p. 263. What is there said on the Poem on Queen Anne's Peace more probably belongs to this Essay. The peace was not signed till March 30, 1713. By Swift's Journal to Stella, Dec. 22, 25, 1712, Jan. 6. 17, 31, and Feb. 19, 1712-13, it appears that this poem received several corrections in consequence of hints from Dr. Swift, who introduced Parnell both to Oxford and Bolingbroke. N..TO HENRY LORD VISCOUNT BOLINGBROKE.BY DR. PARNELLAllegory is in itself so retired a way of Writing, that it was thought proper to say something beforehand concerning this Piece, which is entirely framed upon it. The design, therefore, is to shew the several Styles which have been made use of by those who have endeavoured to write in verse. The scheme, by which it is carried on, supposes an old Grecian Poet couching his observations or instructions within an Allegory; which Allegory is wrought out upon the single word Flight, as in the figurative way it signifies a thought above the common level: here Wit is made to be Pegasus, and the Poet his Rider, who flies by several countries where he must not touch, by which are meant so many vicious Styles, and arrives at last at the Sublime. This way of Writing is not only very engaging to the fancy whenever it is well performed; but it has been thought also one of the first that the Poets made use of. Hence arose many of those stories concerning the Heathen Gods, which at first were invented to insinuate Truth and Morality more pleasingly, and which afterwards made Poetry itself more solemn, when they happened to be received into the Heathen Divinity. And indeed there seems to be no likelier way by which a Poetical Genius may yet appear as an Original, than that he should proceed with a full compass of thought and knowledge, either to design his plan, or to beautify the parts of it, in an allegorical manner. We are much beholden to Antiquity
for those excellent compositions by which Writers at present form their minds; but it is not so much required of us to adhere merely to their fables, as to observe their manner. For, if we preclude our own invention, Poetry will consist only in expression, or simile, or the application of old stories; and the utmost character to which a Genius can arrive will depend on imitation, or a borrowing from others, which we must agree together not to call stealing, because we take only from the Ancients. There have been Poets amongst ourselves, such as Spenser and Milton, who have successfully ventured further. These instances may let us see that Invention is not bounded by what has been done before: they may open our imaginations, and be one method of preserving us from Writing without schemes. As for what relates any further particularly to this Poem, the Reader will observe, that its aim is Instruction. Perhaps a representation of several mistakes and difficulties, which happen to many who write Poetry, may deter some from attempting what they have not been made for: and perhaps the description of several beauties belonging to it may afford hints towards forming a Genius for delighting and improving mankind. If either of these happen, the Poem is useful; and upon that account its faults may be more easily excused. PARNELL.."—Vatibus addere calcar," Ut studio majore petant Helicona virentem."HOR. Ep. II. 1.I HATE the vulgar with untuneful mind;Hearts uninspir'd, and senses unrefin'd.Hence, ye prophane: I raise the sounding string,And Bolingbroke defcends to hear me sing.When Greece could truth in Mystie Fable shroud,And with delight instruct the listening crowd,An ancient Poet (Time has lost his name)Deliver'd strains on Verse to future fame.Still, as he sung, he touch'd the trembling lyre,And felt the notes a rising warmth inspire.Ye sweetening Graces, in the Music throng,Assist my genius, and retrieve the songFrom dark oblivion. See, my genius goesTo call it forth. 'Twas thus the Poem rose." WIT is the Muses' horse, and bears on highThe daring rider to the Muses' sky:Who, while his strength to mount aloft he tries,By regions varying in their nature flies.At first, he riseth o'er a land of toil,A barren, hard, and undeserving soil,Where only weeds from heavy labour grow,Which yet the nation prune, and keep for show.Where couplets jingling on their accent run,Whose Point of Epigram is sunk to Pun;Where These and the like conceits of putting Poems into seve-shapes by the different lengths of lines, are frequent in old Poets of most languages. PARNELL. wings by fancy never feather'd fly,Where lines by measure form'd in Hatchets lie;Where Altars stand, erected Porches gape,And sense is cramp'd while words are par'd to shape;Where mean Acrosticks, labour'd in a frameOn scatter'd letters, raise a painful scheme;And, by confinement in their work, controlThe great enlargings of the boundless soul;Where if a warrior's elevated fireWould all the brightest strokes of verse require,Then straight in Anagram a wretched crewWill pay their undeserving praises too;While on the rack his poor disjointed nameMust tell its master's character to Fame.And (if my fire and fears aright presage)The labouring writers of a future ageShall clear new ground, and grots and caves repair,To civilize the babbling echoes there.Then, while a lover treads a lonely walk,His voice shall with its own reflection talk,The closing sounds of all the vain deviceSelect by trouble frivolously nice,Resound through verse, and with a false pretenceSupport the dialogue, and pass for sense.Can things like these to lasting praise pretend?Can any Muse the worthless toil befriend?Ye sacred Virgins, in my thoughts ador'd,Ah, be for ever in my lines deplor'd,If tricks on words acquire an endless name,And trifles merit in the court of Fame!"At this the Poet stood concern'd a while,And view'd his objects with a scornful smile:Then other images of different kind,With different workings, enter'd on his mind;At whose approach, he felt the former gone,And shiver'd in conceit, and thus went on:" By a cold region next the Rider goes,Where all lies cover'd in eternal snows;Where no bright Genius drives the chariot high,To glitter on the ground, and gild the sky.Bleak level Realm, where Frigid Styles abound,Where never yet a daring thought was found,But counted feet is Poetry defin'd;And starv'd conceits, that chill the reader's mind,A little sense in many words imply,And drag in loitering numbers slowly by.Here dry sententious speeches, half asleep,Prolong'd in lines, o'er many pages creep;Nor ever shew the passions well express'd,Nor raise like passions in another's breast.Here flat narrations fair exploits debase,In measures void of every shining grace;Which never arm their hero for the field,Nor with prophetic story paint the shield,Nor six the crest, nor make the feathers wave,Nor with their characters reward the brave;Undeck'd they stand, and unadorn'd with praise,And fail to profit while they fail to please.Here forc'd Description is so strangely wrought,It never stamps its image on the thought;The lifeless trees may stand for ever bare,And rivers stop, for aught the readers care;They see no branches trembling in the woods,Nor hear the murmurs of increasing floods,Which near the roots of ruffled waters flow,And shake the shadows of the boughs below.Ah, sacred Verse, replete with heavenly flame,Such cold endeavours would invade thy name!The writer fondly would in these survive,Which, wanting spirit, never seem'd alive:But, if Applause or Fame attend his pen,Let breathless statues pass for breathing men."Here seem'd the Singer touch'd at what he sung,And grief a while delay'd his hand and tongue:But soon he check'd his fingers, chose a strain,And flourish'd shrill, and thus arose again:" Pass the next region which appears to show:'Tis very open, unimprov'd, and low;No noble flights of elevated thought,No nervous strength of sense maturely wrought,Possess this Realm; but common turns are there,Which idly sportive move with childish air.On callow wings, and like a plague of flies,The little fancies in a Poem rise,The jaded Reader every where to strike,And move his passions every where alike.There all the graceful nymphs are forc'd to playWhere any water bubbles in the way:There shaggy Satyrs are oblig'd to roveIn all the fields, and over all the grove:There every star is summon'd from its sphere,To dress one face, and make Clorinda fair:There Cupids fling their darts in every song,While Nature stands neglected all along:Till the teaz'd hearer, vex'd at last to findOne constant object still assault the mind,Admires no more at what's no longer new,And hastes to shun the persecuting view.There bright surprizes of Poetic rage(Whose strength and beauty, more confirm'd in ageFor having lasted, last the longer still)By weak attempts are imitated ill,Or carried on beyond their proper light,Or with refinement flourish'd out of sight.There Metaphors on Metaphors abound,And sense by differing images confound:Strange injudicious management of thought,Not born to rage, nor into method brought.Ah, sacred Muse! from such a Realm retreat,Nor idly waste the influence of thy heatOn shallow soils, where quick productions rise,And wither as the warmth that rais'd them dies."Here o'er his breast a sort of pity roll'd,Which something labouring in the mind control'd,And made him touch the loud resounding strings,While thus with Music's stronger tones he sings:" Mount higher still, still keep thy faithful seat,Mind the firm reins, and curb thy courser's heat;Nor let him touch the Realms that next appear,Whose hanging turrets seem a fall to fear;And strangely stand along the tracts of air,Where thunder rolls, and bearded comets glare.The thoughts that most extravagantly soar,The words that sound as if they meant to roar;For rant and noise are offer'd here to choice,And stand elected by the public voice.All schemes are slighted which attempt to shineAt once with strange and probable design;'Tis here a mean conceit, a vulgar view,That bears the least respect to seeming true;While every trifling turn of things is seenTo move by Gods descending in machine.Here swelling lines with stalking strut proceed,And in the clouds terrific rumblings breed;Here single heroes deal grim deaths around,And armies perish in tremendous sound;Here fearful monsters are preserv'd to die,In such a tumult as affrights the sky;For which the golden sun shall hide with dread,And Neptune lift his sedgy-matted head,Admire the roar, and dive with dire dismay,And seek his deepest chambers in the sea.To raise their subject thus the lines devise,And false extravagance would fain surprize;Yet still, ye Gods, ye live untouch'd by fear,And undisturb'd at bellowing monsters here:But with compassion guard the brain of men,If thus they bellow through the Poet's pen:So will the Reader's eyes discern arightThe rashest sally from the noblest flight,And find that only boast and sound agreeTo seem the life and voice of majesty,When Writers rampant on Apollo call,And bid him enter and possess them all,And make his flames afford a wild pretenceTo keep them unrestrain'd by common sense.Ah, sacred Verse! lest Reason quit thy seat,Give none to such, or give a gentler heat."'Twas here the Singer felt his temper wroughtBy fairer prospects, which arose to thought;And in himself a while collected sat,And much admir'd at this, and much at that;Till all the beauteous forms in order ran,And then he took their track, and thus began:" Above the beauties, far above the showIn which weak Nature dresses here below,Stands the great palace of the Bright and Fine,Where fair ideas in full glory shine;Eternal models of exalted parts,The pride of minds, and conquerors of hearts.Upon the first arrival here, are seenRang'd walks of bay, the Muses' ever-green,Each sweetly springing from some sacred bough,Whose circling shade adorn'd a Poet's brow,While through the leaves, in unmolested skies,The gentle breathing of applauses flies,And flattering sounds are heard within the breze,And pleasing murmur runs among the trees,And falls of water join the flattering sounds,And murmur softening from the shore rebounds.The warbled melody, the lovely sights,The calms of solitude inspire delights,The dazzled eyes, the ravish'd ears, are caught,The panting heart unites to purer thought,And grateful shiverings wander o'er the skin,And wondrous ecstasies arise within,Whence admiration overflows the mind,And leaves the pleasure felt, but undefin'd.Stay, daring Rider, now no longer rove;Now pass to find the palace through the grove:Whate'er you see, whate'er you feel, displayThe Realm you sought for; daring Rider, stay.Here various Fancy spreads a varied scene,And Judgement likes the sight, and looks serene,And can be pleas'd itself, and helps to please,And joins the work, and regulates the lays.Thus, on a plan design'd by double care,The building rises in the glitterring air,With just agreement fram'd in every part,And smoothly polish'd with the nicest art.Here laurel-boughs, which ancient heroes wore,Now not so fading as they prov'd before,Wreath round the pillars which the Poets rear,And slope their points to make a foliage there.Here chaplets, pull'd in gently-breathing wind,And wrought by lovers innocently kind,Hung o'er the porch, their fragrant odours give,And fresh in lasting song for ever live.The shades, for whom with such indulgent careFame wreaths the boughs, or hangs the chaplets there,To deathless honours thus preserv'd above,For ages conquer, or for ages love.Here bold Description paints the walls within,Her pencil touches, and the world is seen:The fields look beauteous in their flowery pride,The mountains rear aloft, the vales subside;The cities rise, the rivers seem to play,And hanging rocks repell the foaming sea;The foaming seas their angry billows show,Curl'd white above, and darkly roll'd below,Or cease their rage, and, as they calmly lie,Return the pleasing pictures of the sky;The skies, extended in an open view,Appear a lofty distant arch of blue,In which Description stains the painted bow,Or thickens clouds, and feathers-out the snow,Or mingles blushes in the morning ray,Or gilds the noon, or turns an evening gray.Here, on the pedestals of War and Peace,In different rows, and with a different grace,Fine Statues proudly ride, or nobly stand,To which Narration with a pointing handDirects the sight, and makes examples pleaseBy boldly venturing to dilate in praise;While chosen beauties lengthen out the song,Yet make her hearers never think it long.Or if, with closer art, with sprightly mien,Scarce like herself, and more like Action seen,She bids their facts in images arise,And seem to pass before the Reader's eyes,The words like charms inchanted motion give,And all the Statues of the Palace live.Then hosts embattled stretch their lines afar,Their leaders' speeches animate the war,The trumpets sound, the feather'd arrows fly,The sword is drawn, the lance is toss'd on high,The brave press-on, the fainter forces yield,And death in different shapes deforms the field.Or, should the shepherds be dispos'd to play,Amintor's jolly pipe beguiles the day,And jocund Echos dally with the sound,And Nymphs in measures trip along the ground,And, ere the dews have wet the grass below,Turn homewards singing all the way they go.Here, as on circumstance Narrations dwell.And tell what moves, and hardly seem to tell,The toil of Heroes on the dusty plains,Or on the green the merriment of Swains,Reflection speaks: then all the Forms that roseIn life's inchanted scene themselves compose;Whilst the grave voice, controling all the spells,With solemn utterance, thus the Moral tells:" So Public Worth its enemies destroys,Or Private Innocence itself enjoys."Here all the Passions, for their greater sway,In all the power of words themselves array;And hence the soft Pathetic gently charms,And hence the bolder fills the breast with arms.Sweet Love in numbers finds a world of darts,And with Desirings wounds the tender hearts.Fair Hope displays its pinions to the wind,And flutters in the lines, and lifts the mind.Brisk Joy with transport fills the rising strain,Breaks in the notes, and bounds in every vein.Stern Courage, glittering in the sparks of Ire,Inflames those lays that set the breast on fire.Aversion learns to fly with swifter will,In numbers taught to represent an ill.By frightful accents Fear produces fears;By sad expression Sorrow melts to tears:And dire Amazement and Despair are broughtBy words of Horror through the wilds of thought.'Tis thus tumultuous Passions learn to roll;Thus, arm'd with Poetry, they win the soul.Pass further through the Dome, another viewWould now the pleasures of thy mind renew,Where oft Description for the colours goes,Which raise and animate its native shows;Where oft Narration seeks a florid graceTo keep from sinking ere 'tis time to cease;Where easy turns Reflection looks to find,When Morals aim at dress to please the mind;Where lively Figures are for use array'd,And these an Action, those a Passion, aid.There modest Metaphors in order sit,With unaffected, undisguising Wit,That leave their own, and seek another's place,Not forc'd, but changing with an easy pace,To deck a notion faintly seen before,And Truth preserves her shape, and shines the more.By these the beauteous Similes reside,In look more open, in design ally'd,Who, fond of likeness, from another's faceBring every feature's corresponding grace,With near approaches in expression flow,And take the turn their pattern loves to show;As in a glass the shadows meet the fair,And dress and practise with resembling air.Thus Truth by pleasure doth her aim pursue,Looks bright, and fixes on the doubled view.There Repetitions one another meet,Expressly strong, or languishingly sweet,And raise the sort of sentiment they please,And urge the sort of sentiment they raise.There close in order are the Questions plac'd,Which march with art conceal'd in shows of haste,And work the Reader till his mind be broughtTo make its answers in the Writer's thought.For thus the moving Passions seem to throng,And with their quickness force the soul along;And thus the soul grows fond they should prevail,When every Question seems a fair appeal;And if by just degrees of strength they soar,In steps as equal each affects the more.There strange Commotion, naturally shown,Speaks on regardless that she speaks alone,Nor minds if they to whom she talks be near,Nor cares if that to which she talks can hear.The warmth of Anger dares an absent Foe;The words of Pity speak to tears of Woe;The Love that hopes, on errands sends the breeze;And Love despairing moans to naked trees.There stand the new Creations of the Muse,Poetic Persons, whom the Writers useWhene'er a cause magnificently greatWould fix attention with peculiar weight.'Tis hence that humble Provinces are seenTransform'd to Matrons with neglected mien,Who call their Warriors in a mournful sound,And shew their Crowns of Turrets on the ground,While over Urns reclining Rivers moanThey should enrich a nation not their own.'Tis hence the Virtues are no more confin'dTo be but rules of reason in the mind;The heavenly Forms start forth, appear to breathe,And in bright shapes converse with men beneath;And, as a God in combat Valour leads,In council Prudence as a Goddess aids.There Exclamations all the voice employIn sudden flushes of Concern or Joy:Then seem the sluices, which the Passions bound,To burst asunder with a speechless sound;And then with tumult and surprize they roll,And shew the case important in the soul.There rising Sentences attempt to speak,Which Wonder, Sorrow, Shame, or Anger, break;But so the Part directs to find the rest,That what remains behind is more than guess'd.Thus fill'd with ease, yet left unfinish'd too,The sense looks large within the Reader's view:He freely gathers all the Passion means,And artful silence more than words explains.Methinks a thousand Graces more I see,And I could dwell—but when would thought be free?Engaging Method ranges all the band,And smooth Transition joins them hand in hand:Around the musick of my lays they throng,Ah, too deserving objects of my song!Live, wondrous Palace, live secure of time,To Senses Harmony, to Souls sublime,And just Proportion all, and great Design,And lively Colours, and an Air divine.'Tis here that, guided by the Muses' fire,And fill'd with sacred thought, her Friends retire,Unbent to care, and unconcern'd with noise,To taste repose and elevated joys,Which in a deep untroubled leisure meet,Serenely ravishing, politely sweet.From hence the Charms that most engage they choose,And, as they please, the glittering objects use;While to their Genius, more than Art, they trust,Yet Art acknowledges their labours just.From hence they look, from this exalted show,To choose their subject in the world below,And where an Hero well deserves a name,They consecrate his acts in song to Fame;Or, if a Science unadorn'd they find,They smooth its look to please and teach the mind;And where a Friendship 's generously strong,They celebrate the knot of souls in song;Or, if the Verses must inflame Desire,The thoughts are melted, and the words on fire:But, when the Temples deck'd with glory stand,And hymns of Gratitude the Gods demand,Their bosoms kindle with Celestial Love,And then alone they cast their eyes above.Hail, sacred Verse! ye sacred Muses, hail!Could I your pleasures with your fire reveal,The world might then be taught to know you right,And court your rage, and envy my delight.But, whilst I follow where your pointed beamsMy course directing shoot in golden streams,The bright appearance dazzles Fancy's eyes,And weary'd-out the fix'd Attention lies;Enough, my Verses, have you work'd my breast,I'll seek the sacred Grove, and sink to rest."No longer now the ravish'd Poet sung,His voice in easy cadence left the tongue;Nor o'er the musick did his fingers fly,The sounds ran tingling, and they seem'd to die.O, Bolingbroke! O Favourite of the skies,O born to gifts by which the noblest rise,Improv'd in arts by which the brightest please,Intent to business, and polite for ease;Sublime in eloquence, where loud applauseHath stil'd thee Patron of a nation's cause.'Twas there the world perceiv'd and own'd thee great,Thence Anna call'd thee to the reins of State;" Go, said the greatest Queen, with Oxford go,And still the tumults of the world below,Exert thy powers, and prosper; he that knowsTo move with Oxford, never should repose."She spake: the Patriot overspread thy mind,And all thy days to public good resign'd.Else might thy soul, so wonderfully wroughtFor every depth and turn of curious thought,To this the Poet's sweet recessThat his Lordship occasionally cultivated the Muses, may be seen in the fourth volume of this Miscellany. N. retreat,And thence report the pleasures of the seat,Describe the raptures which a Writer knows,When in his breast a vein of fancy glows,Describe his business while he works the mine,Describe his temper when he sees it shine,Or say, when Readers easy verse insnares,How much the Writer's mind can act on theirs:Whence images, in charming numbers set,A sort of likeness in the soul beget,And what fair visions oft we fancy nighBy fond delusions of the swimming eye,Or further pierce through Nature's maze to findHow passions drawn give passions to the mind.Oh, what a sweet confusion! what surprize!How quick the shifting views of pleasure rise!While, lightly skimming, with a transient wing,I touch the beauties which I wish to sing.Is Verse a sovereign Regent of the soul,And fitted all its motions to control?Or are they sisters, tun'd at once above,And shake like unisons if either move?For, when the numbers sing an eager sight,I've heard a soldier's voice express delight;I've seen his eyes with crowding spirits shine,And round his hilt his hand unthinking twine.When from the shore the fickle Trojan flies,And in sweet measures poor Eliza dies,I've seen the book forsake the virgin's hand,And in her eyes the tears but hardly stand.I've known her blush at soft Corinna's name,And in red characters confess a flame:Or wish success had more adorn'd his arms,Who gave the world for Cleopatra's charms.Ye Sons of Glory, be my first appeal,If here the power of lines these lines reveal.When some great youth has with impetuous thoughtRead o'er atchievements which another wrought,And seen his courage and his honour goThrough crowding nations in triumphant show,His soul, enchanted by the words he reads,Shines all impregnated with sparkling seeds,And courage here, and honour there, appearsIn brave design that soars beyond his years,And this a spear, and that a chariot lends,And war and triumph he by turns attends;Thus gallant pleasures are his waking dream.Till some fair cause have call'd him forth to fame.Then, form'd to life on what the Poet made,And breathing slaughter, and in arms array'd,He marches forward on the daring foe,And emulation acts in every blow.Great Hector's shade in fancy stalks along,From rank to rank amongst the martial throng;While from his acts he learns a noble rage,And shines like Hector in the present age.Thus verse will raise him to the victor's bays;And verse, that rais'd him, shall resound his praise.Ye tender Beauties, be my witness too,If Song can charm, and if my Song be true.With sweet experience oft a Fair may findHer passions mov'd by passions well design'd;And then she longs to meet a gentle swain,And longs to love, and to be lov'd again.And if by chance an amorous youth appears,With pants and blushes she the courtship hears;And finds a tale that must with theirs agree,And he's Septimius, and his Acme" With such a husband, such a wife,," With Acme and Septimius' life,"
is the conclusion of Cowley's beautiful imitation of Catullus, in the English Poets, vol. I. p. 176. On these lines an excellent Prelate has observed, that, to the honour of Cowley's morals and good taste, by a small deviation from his original, he has converted a loose love-poem into a sober epithalamium; we have all the grace, and, what is more, all the warmth of Catullus, without his indecency.

"The Chimney's Scuffle, 1662," a very indifferent poem, seems to have given rise to this and many other of similar titles; among others, to
"Fragmenta Carceris; or, The King's-Bench Scuffle; with the Humours of the Common-side; the King's-Bench Litany, and the Legend of Duke Humphrey, by Samuel Speed, a Member of that Royal Society, 1675."

S.These initials are possibly intended for Sir Roger L'Estrange; who, among other vicissitudes of fortune, spent near six years in gaols, and almost four under a sentence of death in Newgate. — Richard Steere, the only contemporary poet I can find with these initials, was author of some well-meaning, but indifferent, verses on a religious subject, called,

N..LET that majestic pen that writesOf brave King Arthur and his Knights,And of their noble feats and fights;And those who tell of Mice and Frogs,And of the skirmishes of Hogs,And of fierce Bears, and Mastiff Dogs,be silent.And now let each one listen well,While I the famous Battle tell,In Woodstreet-Counter that befell,in high Lent;In which great scuffle only twain,Without much hurt, or being slain,Immortal honour did obtainby merit.One was a Captain in degree,A strong and lusty man was he;T' other a Tradesman bold and freeof spirit.And though he was no man of force,He had a stomach like a horse,And in his rage had no remorseor pity,Full nimbly could he cuss and clout,And was accounted, without doubt,One of the prettiest sparks aboutthe city.And at his weapon any wayHe could perform a single fay,Even from the long pike to the Taylor'sbodkin.He reckt not for his flesh a jot,He fear'd not Englishman nor Scot,For man or monster car'd he nota dodkin.For fighting was his recreation,And like a man in desperation,For Law, Edict, or Proclamation,he car'd not:And in his anger (cause being given)To lift his hand 'gainst good Sir Steeven,Or any justice under Heaven,he fear'd not.He durst his enemy withstand,Or at Tergoos or Calis-Sand,And bravely there with sword in handwould greet him.And noble Ellis was his name,Who, 'mongst his foes to purchase fame,Not cared though the Devil cameto meet him.And this brave Goldsmith was the man,Who first this worthy brawl began,Which after ended in a canof mild beer.But, had you seen him when he fought,How eagerly for blood he sought,There's no man but would have him thoughta wild bear,Imagine now you see a scoreOf mad-cap gentlemen, or more,Boys that did use to roist and roar,and swagger:Among the which were three or four,That rul'd themselves by wisdom's lore,Whose very grandfires scarcely worea dagger.A Priest and Lawyer, men well readIn wiping spoons and chipping bread,And falling to, short grace being said,full oundly:Whose hungry maws no sallads needGood appetites therein to breed,Their stomachs without sauce could feedprofoundly.'Twas ill that men of sober diet,Who lov'd to fill their guts in quiet,Were plac'd with ruffians that to riotwere given.And (O great grief!) e'en from their food(Their stomachs too being strong and good)And that sweet place whereon it stood,be driven.But here 'tis sitting I repeatWhat food our dainty prisoners eat;But if, in placing of the meatand dishes,From curious order I do swerve,'Tis that themselves did none observe,For which nor flesh they did deserve,nor fishes.But some, perhaps, will say that LentAffords them not what here is meant,So much, so good; and that they wentwithout it.'Tis like: but, if I add a dish,Or twain, or three, of flesh or fish,They either had, or did it wish,ne'er doubt it.Then wipe your mouths, while I declareThe goodness of this Lenten fare,Which is in prison very rare,I tell ye.Furmity, sweet as any Nut,As good as ever swill'd a gut,And butter sweet as e'er was putin belly.Eggs by the dozen, new and good,Which, in white salt, uprightly stood,And meats which heat and stir the bloodto action.As butter'd Crabs, and Lobsters red,Which send the married pair to bed,And in loose bloods have often breda faction.Fish butter'd to the platter's brim,And Parsnips did in butter swim,Strew'd o'er with pepper neat and trim,Salt Salmon.Smelts cry'd, come eat me, do not stay;Fresh-cod and Maids full neatly lay,And next to these a lusty Ba-con Gammon.Stuck thick with cloves upon the back,Well stuft with sage, and for the smack,Daintily strew'd with pepper black.Sous'd Gurnet,Pickrell, Sturgeon, Tench, and Trout,Meat far too good for such a rout,To tumble, toss, and throw about,and spurn it.The next a Neat's-tongue neatly dry'd,Mustard and Sugar by his side,Roaches butter'd, Flounders fry'd,hot Custard.Eels boil'd and broil'd; and next they bringHertings, that is the Fishes King,And then a courtly Poul of Lingand Mustard.But stay, I had almost forgotThe flesh which still stands piping hot,Some from the spit, some from the potnew taken:A Shoulder and a Leg of Mutton,As good as ever knife was put on,Which never were by a true gluttonforsaken.A Loin of Veal that would have dar'dOne of the hungriest of the Guard;And they sometimes will feed full hard,like tall men.And such as love the lusty Chine;But, when that I shall sup or dine,God grant they be no Guests of mine,of all men!Thus the descriptions are compleat,Which I have made of Men and Meat:Mars, aid me now while I repeatthe battle,Where pots and stools were us'd as ginsTo break each other's heads and shins,Where blows did make bones in their skinsto rattle;Where men to madness never ceas'd,Till each one (furious as a beast)Had spoil'd the fashion of a feastfull dainty;Whereon (had they not been accurst)They might have fed till bellies burst:But Ellis shew'd himself the worstof twenty.For he began this monstrous brawl,Which afterwards incens'd them allTo throw the meat about the hallthat even.And now give ear unto the jarThat fell between these men of war,Wherein so many a harmless scarwas given.The board thus finish'd, each man sateSome fell to feeding, some to prate,'Mong whom a jarring question straitwas risenFor they grew hotly in dispute,What calling was of most repute;'Twas well their wits were so acutein prison.THE PARSON.While they discours'd, the Parson blitheFed as he meant to have the titheOf every dish, being sharp as scythein feeding.But haste had almost made him choke,Or else, perhaps, he would have spokeIn praise of his long thread-bare cloakand breeding.THE LAWYER.But, after a deliberate pause,The Lawyer spoke, as he had cause,In commendation of the Lawsprofession." The Law, quoth he, by a just doomDoth censure all that to it come,And still defends the innocent fromoppression;It favours Truth, it curbs the hopeOf Vice; it gives Allegiance scope,Provides a gallows and a ropefor Treason.This doth the Law, and this is itWhich makes us here in prison sit,Which grounded is on holy writand reason.To which all men must subject be,As we by daily proof do see,From highest to the low'st degree;the Scholar,Noble, and Rich: it doth subdueThe Soldier and his swaggering crew—"But at that word the Captain grewin choler;THE SOLDIER.He look'd full grim, and at first wordRapt out an oath that shook the board,And struck his fist, that the sound roar'dlike thunder;It made all skip that stood him near,The frighted Custard quak'd for fear,And those that heard it stricken werewith wonder;Nought did he now but frown and puff,And, having star'd and swore enough,Thus he began, in language rough," Thou coggingBase foysting Lawyer, that dost setThy mind on nothing but to getThy living by thy damned pet-tifogging.A slave, that shall for half a crown,With buckram bag and daggled gown,Wait like a dog about the town,and followA business on the Devil's partFor fees, though not with law nor art,But head as empty as thy heartis hollow;You stay at home, and pocket fees,While we abroad our bloods do leese,And then with such base terms as theseyou wrong us;But, Lawyer, it is safer farFor thee to prattle at a bar,Than once to shew thy face i' th' waramong us;Where, to defend such thankless hinds,The soldier little quiet finds,But is expos'd to stormy windsand weathers,And oft in blood he wades full deep,Your throats from foreign swords to keep,And wakes when you securely sleepin feathers.What could your Laws and Statutes doAgainst invasions of a Foe,Did not the valiant Soldier goto quell them?And, to prevent your further harms,With ensign, fife, and loud alarmsOf warlike drum, by force of armsrepell them?Your Trespass Action will not stand,For setting foot upon your land,When they in scorn of your commandcome hither:No remedy in Courts of Paul'sThe Ecclesiastical Court. N.,In Common-Pleas, or in the Rolls,For jouling of your jobbernoulstogether.Were 't not for us, thou Swad! (quoth he)Where would'st thou fog to get a fee?But to defend such things as thee,'tis pity.For such as thou esteem us least,Whoever have been ready prestTo guard you, and the Cuckow's nest,your city."THE CITIZEN.That very word made Ellis start,And all his blood ran to his heart;He shook, and quak'd in every partwith anger:He look'd as if nought might assuageThe heat of his enflamed rage;His very countenance did presagesome danger." A Cuckow's nest!" quoth he, and soHe humm'd, and held his head full low,As if distracted thoughts did o-verpress him.At length, quoth he, "My mother said,At Bristol she was brought-to-bed,And there was Ellis born and bred,(God bless him!)Of London-city I am free,And there I first my wife did see;And for that very cause, quoth he,I love it:And he that calls it Cuckow's nest,Except he says he speaks in jest,He is a villain and a beast,I 'll prove it:This I 'll maintain, nor do I careThough Captain Pot-gun stamp and stare,And swagger, swear, and tear his hairin fury;And, with the hazard of my blood,I 'll fight up to the knees in mud,But I will make my quarrel good,assure ye.For though I am a man of trade,And free of London-city made,Yet can I use Gun, Bill, and Blade,in battle;And Citizens, if need require,Themselves can force the foe retire,Whatever this Low-Country squiredo prattle;For we have Soldiers of our own,Able enough to guard the town,And Captains of most fair renownabout it;If any foe should fight amain,And set on us with all his train;We 'll make him to retire again,ne'er doubt it.We have fought well in dangers past,And will do while our lives do last,Without the help of any castCommanders,That hither come, compell'd by want,With rusty swords and suits provant,From Utrecht, Nimeguen, or Ghent,in Flanders."The Captain could no longer hold;But, looking fiercely, plainly toldThe Citizen, he was too bold,and call'd himProud Boy, and for his saucy speechDid vow shortly to whip his breech:Then Ellis snatcht the pot, with whichhe maul'd him.THE SCUFFLE.He threw the jug, and therewithalDid give the Captain such a maulAs made him thump against the wallhis crupper.With that the Captain took a dishThat stood brim-full of butter'd fish,As good as any heart could wishto supper:And as he threw, his foot did slide,Which turn'd his arm and dish aside,And all be-butterfishifideNick Ballat:And he, good man! did none disease;But sitting quiet and at his ease,With butter'd Rochets thought to pleasehis palate.But, when he felt the wrong he had,He rag'd, and swore, and grew stark-mad;Some in the room been better hadwithout him;For he took hold of any thing;And first he caught the Poul of Ling,Which he courageously did flingabout him:Out of his hand it flew apace,And hit the Lawyer in the face,Who at the board in highest placewas seated.And as the Lawyer thought to rise,The salt was thrown into his eyes,Which him of sight in woeful wisedefeated.All things near hand Nick Ballat threw;At length his butter'd Rochets flew,And hit by chance, among the crew,the Parson:The sauce his coat did all bewet,The Priest began to fume and fret,The seat was butter'd which he sethis * * * * on:He knew not what to do or say,It was in vain to preach or pray,Or cry, "You are all gone astray,good people!"He might as well go strive to teachDivinty beyond his reach;Or, when the bells ring out, go preachi' th' steeple.At this mischance, the silly manOut of the room would fain have ran,And very angerly beganto mutter.Ill luck had he; for, after that,One threw the Parsnips full of fat,Which stuck like Broaches in his hatwith butter.Out of the place he soon repairs,And ran half headlong down the stairs,And made complaint to Master Aires,with crying.Then up ran he to know the matter,And found how they the things did scatter;Here a Trencher, there a Platter,were lying.I dare not say he stunk for woe,Nor will, unless I did it know;But some there be that dare say so,that smelt him.Nor could you blame him if he did,For they threw dishes at his head,And did with Eggs and Loaves of Breadbepelt him.He thrust himself into the throng,And us'd the virtue of his tongue;But what could one man's words amongso many?The Candles were all shuffled out,The Victuals flew afresh about;Was never such a combat foughtby any.Now in the dark was all the coil;Some were bloody in the broil,And some were steep'd in Sallad-oiland Mustard.The sight would make a man afeard:Another had a butter'd beard,Another's face was was all besmear'dwith Custard:Others were daub'd up to the kneeWith butter'd Fish and Furmity;And some the men could scarcely seethat beat them.Under the Boar LluellinWill Lluellin, a prisoner there, some time the keeper.

In the mean,One calls up Madge the Kitchin-quean;To take and make the baby clean,and clout it.Fast by the nose she took the squall,And led him softly through the hall,Lest the perfume through knees should fallabout it.She turn'd his hose beneath the knee,Nor could she chuse but laugh to seeThat yellow which was wont to bea white breech.She took a dish-clout off the shelf,And with it wip'd the sh***** elf,Which had not wit to help itself,poor ****-breech.Thus leaving Lockwood all bewray'dUnto the mercy of the maid,Who well deserved to be paidfor takingSuch homely pains: now let us castOur thought back on the stir that's past,And them whose bones could not in hasteleave aching.And, like the candles, shall my penShew you these gallants once again;Which now like Furies, not like men,appeared.Fresh lights being brought t' appease the brawl,Shew twenty mad-men in the hall,With blood and sauce their faces allbesmeared.Their cloaths all rent and souc'd in drink,Oil, Mustard, Butter, and the stinkWhich Lockwood left, would make one thinkin sadness,That these so monstrous creatures dwellEither in Bedlam or in Hell,Or that no tongue or pen can telltheir madness.They were indeed disfigur'd so,Friend knew not friend, nor foe-man foe:For each man scarce himself did know:But afterA frantick staring round about,They suddenly did quit their doubt,And loudly all at once brake outin laughter.The heat of all is now allay'd,The Keepers gently do persuade;And, as before, all friends are made.full kindly.Ellis the Captain doth embrace,The Captain doth return the grace,And so do all men in the place,as friendly." By Jove I love thee," Ellis cry'd:The Captain soon as much reply'd:" Thou art, quoth he, a man well try'd:and Vulcan.With Mars at odds again shall be,Ere any jars 'twixt thee and me;And thereupon I drink to theea full can."And then he kneel'd upon the ground," Drink 't off, quoth Ellis, for this roundFor ever shall be held renown'd:and neverMay any quarrel 'twixt us twainArise, or this renew again,But may we loving friends remainfor ever!"" Amen," cry'd the Captain, so did all;And so the health went round the hall;And thus the famous Counter-brawlwas ended.But hunger now did vex them moreThan all their anger did before;They search'd i' th' room how far their storeextended.They want the meat which Blany stole;One finds a Herring in a holeWith dirt and dust black as a coal,and troddenAll under feet. The next in postSnaps up and feeds on what was lost,And looks not whether it were roast,or sodden.A third finds in another placeA piece of Ling in dirty case,And Mustard in his fellow's face.AnotherEspies, and finds a loaf of bread,A dish of butter all bespread,And stuck upon another's headi' th' pother.Thus what they found contented some:At length the Keeper brings a broom,Meaning therewith to cleanse the roomwith sweeping;But under table on the groundLooking to sweep, by chance he foundLluellin, faining to be sound-ly sleeping.He pull'd him out so swift by th' heels,As if his bum had run on wheels,And found his pocket stuff'd with Eels:his ********Did plenty of provision bring,Somewhat it held of every thing,Smelts, Flounders, Rochets, and of Linga broad piece.At this discovery each man roundTook equal share of what was found,Which afterwards they freely drown'din good drink.For of good beer there was good store,Till all were glad to give it o'er;For each man had enough and more,that would drink.And when they thus had drunk and fed,As if no quarrel had been bred,They all shook hands, and all to beddid shuffle.Ellis, the glory of the town,With that brave Captain of renown:And thus I end this famous Coun-ter-Scuffle.TO THE READER.This Bacchanalian night-prize of the Counter-Scuffle being thus finished, hath ever since frighted both prisoners and gaolers from coming into any room, for fear of a second uproar. So that the Counter, for want of sweet garnishing, and cleanly looking to, is grown so nasly that no man (by his good-will) will thrust his nose in at any of the grates: nay,

will rather go a mile about than come near it; though, to keep it sweet, a great deal of mace is stuck upon every serjeant, as if he were a capon in white broth. Upon this slovenliness it is woefully haunted with Rats: not such Rats as run up and down in Brew-houses, sucking the new wort of strong beer so long, and in such abundance, that half the city is compelled to drink beer as small as water; nor those Rats which are not mealy-mouth'd in Bake-houses, where they gnaw so many batches of bread, that a penny loaf wants sometimes three or four ounces in weight: and then the honest Baker is blam'd, and curs'd, and (perhaps) innocently set in the pillory. Neither are they those Rats which greaze their throats in Fallow-chandlers shops, where they nibble so much upon candles, that not one pound in an hundred is ever full weight. No, these are no Rats with four legs, but only two; and though they have nests in a thousand places of London, yet for the most part they run but into two Rattraps, that is to say, the Counters of Wood-street and the Poultry, and for that cause are called Counter-rats:How caught, how mouz'd, and what they are,This picture lively doth declare.R.

Not one of the abovementioned taverns now exists; and every man must remember an amazing number in London more than there are at present.

CONTAINING A TRUE HISTORY; AND SHEWING THE FOLLY, FOPPERY, LUXURY, LAZINESS, PRIDE, AMBITION, AND CONTENTION OF THE ROMISH CLERGY.BY JOHN CROWNEA dramatic writer, whose performances both in comedy and tragedy were acted with applause, though comedy seems to have been more peculiarly his talent. Seventeen of his plays are enumerated by Jacob. He was bred under his father, an independent minister in Nova Scotia. Being a man of some genius, and impatient of the gloomy education he received in that country, he resolved upon coming to England, to try if he could not make his fortune by his wits. When he first arrived here, his necessities were extremely urgent: and he was obliged to become a gentleman-usher to an old Independent lady. But he soon grew as weary of that precise office, as he was of the discipline of Nova Scotia. He set himself therefore to writing; and presently made himself so known to the court and town, that he was nominated by Charles II. to write "The Masque of Calypso." This nomination was procured him by the earl of Rochester: it must not however be ascribed entirely to his merit, but to some little spite in this lord, who designed by that preference to mortify Mr. Dryden. Upon the breaking-out of the two parties, after the pretended discovery of the Popish plot, the favour Crowne was in at court induced him to embrace the Tory party; about which time he wrote a comedy called "The City Politicks," in order to satirize and expose the Whigs. This comedy was by many intrigues of the party-men hindered from appearing upon the stage, till the king himself laid his absolute commands on the lord chamberlain to have it acted immediately. About the latter end of this reign, Crowne, tired out with writing, and desirous to shelter himself from the resentment of many enemies he had made by his "City Politicks," ventured to address the king himself, for an establishment in some office that might be a security to him for life. The king answered,
"he should be provided for;"
but added,
"that he would first see another comedy."
Mr. Crowne endeavoured to excuse himself, by telling the king, that
"he plotted slowly and aukwardly."
His majesty replied, that
"he would help him to a plot;"
and so put into his hand the Spanish comedy, called "Non pued esser," out of which Mr. Crowne took the comedy of "Sir Courtly Nice" The play was just ready to appear to the world; and Mr. Crowne extremely delighted to think that he was going to be made happy the remaining part of his life, by the performance of the king's promise. But, upon the last day of the rehearsal, he met Underhill the player coming from the house as he was going to it; upon which, reprimanding him for neglecting so considerable a part as he had in the comedy, and upon the last day too;
"Lord, Sir, says Underhill, we are all undone."
— "How! says Crowne, is the playhouse on fire?"
"The whole nation, replies the player, will quickly be so, for the king is dead."
The king's death ruined Crowne, who had now nothing but his wits to live on for the remaining part of his life. It is not certain when he died, but it is supposed to be somewhere about the year 1703. See Dennis's Letters, 1721, vol. I. p. 48. and the Biographical Dictionary, 8vo. Mr. Crowne was author of two other poems, called "Pandion and Amphiginia," and "Daeneids." N..TO JOHN EARL OF MULGRAVE, &c.MY LORD,I HAVE long been ashamed to see so many of my writings march into the world, and yet, not one of them honoured by your lordship's patronage. It is an easy matter for a troop to force themselves on ladies and

neutral gentlemen, or nobility, who will not arm; but they must be men of some merit and gallantry, who compel regard from a General. Your lordship is as much above us in our own ways, as you are in other respects; and I give this manifest proof of it: your fortune, and, most men believe, your inclination, fixes you on the top of ease and pleasure; therefore you would never have written one line, if it had cost you any pains: yet have you performed masteries, which we, who

make poetry the whole business of our lives, could never equal. In your Essay on Poetry there appears to me a commanding genius standing on a rise, over-looking the age you live in, seeing all the writers in it marching below you, and too often disorderly; and you give us those orders which plainly shew, Poetry attends on you, you may do what you please with it; but we, compared with your lordship, are but poor drudges to it, that have oftener the will than the power to do well. Your lordship has not only a perfect understanding of what is fit to pass in the world, but you are of a severe temper, which will not give your pass to any false sense; the absence therefore of your name from my writings seems a silent charge against me of want of merit. To remove that reproach, I take this occasion to tell the world, your lordship has approved of some of my writings; and I have longed to make my brags of it, but have been hindered either by the unkindness of fortune, which has given me some blow, and made me unfit to appear before you, or by the kindness of some generous persons, by which my writings have been in a manner mortgaged. Though the law of the land does not reckon favour freely bestowed among debts, the law of gratitude does; whenever a man is obliged, a judgement is entered against him. In the late reign, when your lordship graced the Lord Chamberlain's office, you were pleased to shew me those regards which made me vain: and I was very desirous to make it known to the world, but the cloudiness of those times got I think into my head, I did not write so well as I

have done formerly. Now I venture before your lordship, because I bring an acquaintance of yours, I am sure you value, Mr. Boileau; and a piece of his all men of sense have esteemed, because it exposes to contempt men who are the antipodes to good sense; priests who advance nonsense above reason, make trifles of the most solemn matters, and solemn things of trifles, are idle in the great affairs of their calling, and busy in impertinence. By the few we have had amongst us of such kind of Churchmen, we may guess the misery of the people who live in the Roman Church, where there are scarce any other; where the whole mass of priesthood is a heap of proud flesh, and all the strength and nutriment of a nation goes to feed ecclesiastical corruption; thanks be to God, we are in a condition to make sport with them; if ever they come amongst us, they will spoil the jest. And, past dispute, it is very fit to render men contemptible who endeavour to make Religion so. We have had too many in our Church who have busied themselves, and embroiled others about things which the French have had the understanding to know were only fit for a droll. But now we have greater affairs on our hand. We have not time to contend for modes in Religion, when the Being of the Protestant Religion, and indeed the English Nation, lies at stake. In a calm at sea, men may have leisure to wrangle at Chess; but, if a storm arises, the quarrel is at an end, and the bishops, knights, rooks, and pawns, that bred it, are left to shift for themselves. I am well assured the Lutrin pleases your lordship, but I may doubt of

my management of it; for I treat it as an English privateer would do a French prize, great part of it I sling away, and I dash, brew, and disguise, the rest as I think good. I shall not value how the world censures me, if I have the good-fortune to be approved of by your lordship, and thought worthy of the title of, my Lord,Your lordship's most humble and obliged servant,JOHN CROWNE.CANTO I.I SING of Angels—not the heavenly Choir,Whom Peace and Truth, and Harmony inspire.Hoarse brazen trumpet-like is my rough voice,Jarring Church-Angels, therefore, are my choice.In mighty Paris two great spirits reign'd,Where one with ease could not be well contain'd.They strove, and from them dreadful thunders broke,Which made great Notre-Dame both shake and smoke:And, ere the almost falling Church could fix,Strange janglings made, among Church-candlesticks.Of all the Priests that wealthy Dome supply'dWith laziness, with luxury, and pride,None deeper sunk, or firmlier remain'dIn peace and fat, than he who o'er it reign'd,The Dean; a solid Priest in flesh and bone;He like a sleepy Roller trundled onAlong all times; and gather'd as he roll'dA heavy heap of fat and clammy mold.He never knew when changes went or came,All Times, Faiths, Oaths, appear'd to him the same.He had no palate but for Meats and Wine,In those he was a learn'd profound Divine;And to those studies kept so close and hard,To his Cathedral he paid small regard.Mean-while a haughty, melancholy, sour,Old busy snarling Chanter steep'd in power:Chief of the Chanters there he was by right;But, not contented with that noble height,Usurp'd the Dean's supremacy, and, more,Took high prerogatives unknown before,As scorning power only at second-hand;And he was terrible in his command;He made the Singers shake more than in song,This fierce Usurper rul'd in quiet long,Obey'd, fear'd, honour'd, Church-affairs went onIn a profound still current, cross'd by none.At length the Dean from his long slumbers woke,Burst through his cloud, and Church repose he broke.He saw his reverence and state were gone,And gallantly resolv'd to seize his own;Nay his prelatic legal pomp advanceOn the intruding Chanter's arrogance.The great soul'd Chanter having proudly reign'd,Submission scorn'd, and usurp'd state maintain'd.By his devotion to pomp, power, and pride,He won the zealous Canons to his side;Who, skill'd in causes of that mighty weight,Lent him their aid by many a loud debate:So, of old, Pagan Prelates madly stroveThe Moon's eclipse by noises to remove:Pagans beat dishes, pans, and platters hard,Our Priests no chattering in quotations spar'd.What Devil, envious of Church repose,These fire-balls into holy bosoms throws,And turns the Church to a disorder'd out?How can such fury enter souls devout?Stand off, Atheistic Wits, and Scoffers vain,Do not my grave and solemn song prophane:Great Notre-Dame, the high and stately sceneOf our ensuing story, long had beenAdorn'd and blest with many a deep Divine,Not deep in arts, but in down-beds and wine.Their great devotion doubly they exprest;In Church by pomp, at home by heavenly rest.It grac'd their Master's service, to maintainIn ease themselves his favorite Gentlemen.On their soft beds the morn they dos'd away,And left the Choir the drudgery to pray;And to rich lofty cushions to supplyTher rooms in Church, and raise God's honour highGod was well serv'd, though Priests were never there:Bright Residentiaries the cushions were.The holy men eat, drank, and slept with zeal,All for Heaven's honour, and the Church's weal:Kept from themselves all sacrilegious toil;True to their fat they were, as Rhemes to oil,To anoint Gallic Kings an Angel broughtMuch unctuous fat God sent his holy lot,Our pious Canons, which to keep from wasteCareful they were, not to preach, pray, or fast;Or only fast to give themselves a whet,So when they charg'd, the rout was dreadful great.Sometimes soul-lulling Sermons from them stream'd;But ah! so gently, when they preach'd they seem'dLike Halcyons brooding o'er a slumbering wave,To the Cathedral peaceful calms they gave.No croaking Preacher spoil'd, with tedious din,Good Sunday dinners, or sweet weekly Sin.No noise was there but of harmonious sound,Division there only in song was found.When horrid Discord rear'd her snaky head,To see who entertain'd a calm so dead,So loath'd by her. Her Empire she survey'd,And found her will by millions was obey'd.Gladly she saw in each well-govern'd stateThe law with formal pomp support debate;But Churches highly pleas'd her ear and eye,She saw all Churches set her honour high.Yet our Cathedral, only in Music loud,Lodg'd Peace in scorn of Discord and her crowd.Discord in rage perch'd on the lofty dome,And from her mouth she rain'd a poisonous foam,Which crack'd the glass; martyr'd th' Apostles there;Then with a sigh, which made trees shed their hair,Foul'd the Church-plate, that all its splendors died,Like men in damps; she vented thus her pride:" How dar'st thou, proud Cathedral, friendship shewTo Peace, (said she) my known and vanquish'd foe,Which round the world I 've spurn'd? Where has she rest?In one fair Realm she'as scarce one single breast.How often there in the same person fightWhig, Tory, Williamite, and Jacobite,Who have by turns the better of the fray;As French or Irish get or lose the day;Or, as the hands of their good Moses rise,Well to reward, or sharply to chastise.I 've made myself a barricado strongOf stiff Non-swearers, a most stubborn throng,Who by no art to yield can be compell'd,And grow more hard, like trees by being fell'd.Nay ev'n some Swearers, to advance my reign,The crown secur'd by law unfix again;Carve power by conquest, which is carv'd by law:Some Swearers against these keen weapons draw,Between them Peace and Truth lead wretched lives,These fighters wound them with their carving-knives,Me above Church and State all nations set:And dares one Church neglect a power so great?Woes for thee this provoking crime provides.Streight her enormous figure Discord hidesWith a square cap, a surplice, hood, and gown;Nor from an old sour Canon could be known.Most true to Discord; he wag'd endless warWith Peace, in presses, pulpits, at the bar,All bars of civil and of canon laws,To law he went, with or without a cause.With suits at law all his tithe-corn he ground,Aye, and himself and all his neighbours round.He would not spare his purse, brain, flesh, or bone,To stir the clack of lawyers and his own.Discord and wrangling better to promote,He rail'd, he sued, he studied, and he wrote;Toil'd unlike God, from light he darkness spun;Worlds by this Anti-maker were undone.He preach'd for malice, in the pulpit boil'd,Till dinners and devotions were both spoil'd.When his thin flock by winter winds were flea'd,To gaul the sore, he'd a long service read;Then far above his hour in pulpit rail,Then tack an Altar-service to the tail,Till all their meat was burnt, and noses raw,Some to provoke to give him food for Law.Dissent, assent, his dues detain or pay,(Though not to Heaven) to Court 's the certain way.By this good guide all they were sure to find,Who not conform'd in all things to his mind:If pious reverence they forgot to shewTo altars, and his person, by a bow;And did not service so exactly mark,To start at all responses with the Clerk,To pour their voices in the muttering throng,And help to push the murmuring stream along;If they nick'd not their times to kneel and rise,And on these faults his spectacles were spies.But woe to Hugonots remote or nigh;From his hot busy zeal and watchful eye,Proctors and Paritours had wealthy spoil,And Constables an everlasting toil.Baptismal water, sacramental wine,Cast away much of the reformers coin.Basons and bowls not blest with legal formsWere sure to meet with most confounding storms.Discord had chose this Canon for her own,And therefore markd his brow with many a frown.His lean cheeks wrangled, all the wrinkles clash'dWhene'er they met, and deep his visage slash'd.Therefore his figure Discord wisely wore,For none could fit her better, please her more.CANTO II.TO the Dean's palace stormy Discord steer'd,And finds the bulkly Prelate sepulcher'dIn an alcove and down; in hopes at lastOf joyful resurrection to repast:In his fair spreading cheeks, the Church's chargeHad rais'd a garden beautiful and large;And in two stories built his goodly chin;To let these run to ruin, were a sin.The holy man did no expences spare,To keep them faithfully in good repair;And every part about him fat and sound,For they were Church demesnes and holy ground.Rich curtains gave his slumbers strong defence,Against Da's sacrilegious violence.Soft pillows had his cheeks, and let no airApproach to harm the lively roses there:For Youth's Spring-flowers in his dull Autumn grew,Those checks possessing which were Age's due.All things in order were for dinner laid,When the great Goddess her proud entry made.Such exact order highly pleas'd her eye;She knew the Church by scrupulous decency.In all the joys of silence, ease, and pride,And with a breakfast strongly fortified,The Dean, attending dinner, slumbering lay;When thus the Goddess drove his rest away." Wake quickly, Dean, she said, or wake no more;A Chanter haughtily usurps thy power,Shines in the Choir with thy prelatic grace,And awes it with the same commanding face.All bows of Singers are to him addrest;All Congregations by his mouth are blest;He graces all the Saints high solemn days,When, to oblige them, he in person prays.Shortly he'll youth confirm, and priests ordain,And scarce to thee thy rochet shall remain.Renounce thy prelacy, or thy repose:Thy fortune dooms thee one of them to lose."This said, she breathes into him, through his ear,The spirit of a common Barretter.He wakes and yawns, and with half-open'd eyesGives the dire fiend his blessing as he flies;Then, like a raging bull with hornet stung,Around the chamber his fat body flung;Chid maids and lacqueys, why he did not know,And before dinner to the Choir will go.But his wise Steward much allay'd his rage,By counsels seasonable, calm, and sage." What fury's this, said he, has seiz'd your mind,And hurries you to Church before you've din'd?Oft have you left the work of saving fouls,To sport some hours at tables, chess, or bowls,But for the Church ne'er dinner left till now;The dresser-board is ready for the blow.Your cook now foams, and so does your pot-táge,With your judicious palate to engage.And if your roast-meats you compel to stay,Sir, they will weep their gravy all away.Your haut-gousts, now most vigorous and strong,Will sicken if in cold they tarry long,And never be reviv'd by second heat:Sir, if you go, you'll murder all your meat.It is not Lent; say 'twere, it seems a wasteOf holiness in holy men to fast.Your tongues and pens support Church rites and laws,What need y' engage your bowels in the cause?Sure 'twas the Church's motherly intent,Lent should keep Prelates, and not Prelates Lent.Religiously support your high degree,Do not by toil debase your dignity."This said, he wisely cover'd all the clothWith crowds of dishes, and a flood of broth.Much on the pious Dean this vision wrought;His cloth a while St. Peter's sheet he thought;A treat let down from Heaven in a dream,Till his pleas'd nostrils felt th' inviting steam.Then fiercely he apply'd himself to eat,And found it more than visionary meat.Fast o'er the tongue he turn'd his morsels all;Like morning-collects t a festival;Himself he almost choak'd, but not his wroth,He champ'd his words and meat confusedly both.He skipt from dish to dish, he knew not why,No order minded, nor sweet decency.The Steward thought his Master's end was near,He knew not creatures which he lov'd so dear;And in great sorrow was about to runTo summon friends; but Fame that work had done.They scattering came like troops of daunted cranes,When the proud pigmy a recruit obtains.The visit rais'd the Prelate from despair,Chac'd from his visage the late furious air.So pleas'd he was with the respect they shew'd,That he vouchsaf'd to rise, nay more, he bow'd:Commanded the Westphalia-ham again,Fill'd wine himself to honour the good men,Drank first and largely; the example pleas'd,And strait a flaggon of its load was eas'd.He kindly mov'd them then to take a partOf what remain'd, and of a fair desert;The table clear, out burst his inward pain;" Dear friends, said he, by whose support I reign,Myself your charitable work I own,Which the proud Chanter thinks to tumble down;At least, by interposing in my rights,To make me useless, and blind up my lights.To him do all Church-officers repair;At his command the Sexton rings to prayer.Chapters are held at his usurping call;What need of Deans, if Chanters can do all?"But then tears stopt the current of his talk:His loving Steward empower'd his tongue to walkWith chearful wine, when Bovrude, bending lowWith heavy age, with trembling steps and slow,Enter'd the room. The Church had us'd his painsIn four successive Deans voluptuous reigns.None in Church-customs was so skill'd as he;He was a living true Church-history.His knowledge rais'd him from a Sexton poor,To the high trust of all Church-garniture.Great office! Robes are often half the Dean:This rules those Robes, ordains them to be clean.One in this office half a Dean ordains,O'er half a Dean as Dean he proudly reigns.He has in part an arch-prelatic power;He 's of one college parcel-visitour.At first approach, the Reverend Sage espiesThe Dean's demolish'd pride and groveling eyes.Guessing the cause, he smiling tow'rds him mov'd,And, father-like, his childish grief reprov'd." For shame, said he, let the poor Chanter weep,Your rights and empire study you to keep.Hark to the counsel Heaven does now inspire;Where the proud Chanter over-looks the ChoirWith frowning arrogance, some ages past,The Church was shaded with an engine vast,Desk, throne, or pulpit, call it what you please:At once it serv'd devotion, pomp, and ease.There, thron'd in glory, I have known a Dean,In vestments rich, on velvet cushions lean.Prayer-books, embost with gold, before him shone,Which drew all eyes upon them but his own.A worm stol'n from a grave the Chanter seem'd,Just visible enough to be contemn'd.Time, fate, or fiends, malicious men, or all,(For they 're all foes to good) conspir'd its fall.Malicious men, we think, by secret artGave it a sickness in some noble part,That never visited nor minded well,One morn it yawn'd, and down to ruin fell;And to its worth th' ungrateful Choir unjust,Laid it in dark forgetfulness and dustWhat honour'd once the Choir, has now forlornLain thirty winters languishing in scorn.Three of us, fit for such a great affair,Will, perriwig'd in Night's dishevel'd hair,Steal to the pulpit, in its mournful room,And gloriously reward its martyrdom.If once to murmur the proud Chanter dare,The wretch with forty biting actions tear.Since not in Learning, be in Law renown'd;Shew a Church-spirit, the whole Church confound,Ere quit a tittle of your sacred right;Let Laymen pray. Prelates are known by might.Your dazzling right divine dart at your foe;Then to the Church in all Church-splendor go;And there brow-beat th' usurper to the ground;Then, to out-brave him, disperse blessings round.To blast his pride, and shew yourself supreme,Bless all the Congregation, nay, bless him."The counsel seem'd to admiration wise;The Dean in ravishments, with lifted eyes,Heaven's inspiration most devoutly blest;But strait a new reflection struck his breast." I now have in the Choir a seat, said he.Cloath'd with rich cushions, crown'd with canopyOn what pretence can I erect this throne?"Boyrude reply'd, "A most religious one:Sermons to hear!" Th' assembly trembled allWith horror at the sound fanatical.The Prelate, hotly fir'd, profanely swore;And almost call'd for an Inquisitor." Dar'st thou, said he, name sermons in my ear?I 'll be no Dean, ere buy the place so dear.I 'll rather combat with wild beasts, like Paul,Or, like Isaiah, be saw'd once for all,Than weakly be with torturing sermons saw'd,Postpone my meals, and be with fasting gnaw'd;Nay more, myself into the toil they 'll fetch,And I myself shall be oblig'd to preach."" Make potent Prelates preach! the Sage replies,Pray, by what rule' you are not tongues, but eyes.Our eyes guide all our limbs, yet keep their ease;Labour becomes not highest dignities.Sectaries, like Jews, with wanderings are perplext,Doom'd all their lives to rove from text to text,Die in that wilderness, and ne'er possessRome's blessed holy land of laziness;A land that flows with honey, milk, and gains,At Heaven's sole cost, and not the owner's pains.Of this you 've more than a dim Pisgah sight;And ease is your inviolable right.Make Canons preach; and, while the work is done,Let your austere grave presence lash them on.By their dull saws no doubt you would be pain'd,But you 'll with sweet revenge be entertain'd.They 've uncanonical rebellious tongues,And from them you 've receiv'd a thousand wrongs.Like jades in water-works, Sir, make them sweat,Till from them penetential drops you get.Then you 'll soon have revenge and reverence both;Soon at your feet they 'll fall, to compass sloth."Into a loud applause th' assembly broke,And thought man never with more wisdom spoke.All start, of fame to have the greatest share;But the wise Dean reduc'd them as they were." All things in Church by order must be done,Said he, that rears and fixes every throne.None shall approach this work, but those whom FateShall, by a lot, ordain and consecrate."Thirty selected names are writ with haste,And in the bottom of a bonnet cast.Fairly to draw the billets, they employRosy-cheek'd Will, that pretty Singing-boy;His head new poll'd, his face and linen clean,Though no Saint's-day, for much he pleas'd the Dean.The Prelate all partiality disclaims;Having thrice blest, as often shakes the names.Will draws, and Trole is the first name that comes:Birds promis'd good, which freely peck'd their crumbs;Sure no ill augury could now be read,This red-beak'd bird from liquor never fled.A pleasing murmur in the throng was rais'd,And Fortune's choice by every one was prais'd.Will to his office does again repair,And draws a name, most fatal to the fair,Of a young Singing-man, whose charms ('tis said)Had been the death of many a Chamber-maid.Nay, his keen mounting darts reach'd lofty game,Threatened high ranks with loss of life or fame.Whatever beauty ogled him was lost,And soon became a strumpet, or a ghost.Yet to the dangerous snare they ventur'd all:His silver pipe was a true lady-call,Which both Church-pews and Play-house boxes cram'd,Entic'd the Fair both to be sav'd and damn'd.But, oh! that lady gain'd the height of bliss,Whom he in private taught to sing and kiss.Long the soft sex did for the youth contend;Some took their eyes, some money, for their friend.Some had him all, and some had modest shares,Some clear'd their tones, some gave a crack to theirs.To him his fortune gave a second choice,And now they go to ask Fate's last advice,Their names and panting hearts are tost again,Each fearing Fate his person should disdain.Honest old Verger! what sincere delightShook thy dry corpse, when thy name rose in sight!Thy yellow cheeks turn'd red, and, with a shout,Thou backwards gav'st a spring in spite of gout.Now loyal true Church hearts, who for Church wealHad an unquenchable religious zeal,Much prais'd Fate's choice of men for Church affairs,And wish'd all realms as able ministers;All kings as deep in sight, as Fate had shewnIn chusing men, to serve the Church and Throne.On the design now all prepare to go;And, in a murmuring stream away they flowTo the Dean's cellar, where they rent the archWith drunken songs, and sounded oft a march.The Prelate, calm'd, resum'd his lost repose,And now, till supper, laid him down to dose.CANTO III.NOW Night was in the middle of her reign:Great was her pomp, and spacious was her train.From her large throne of jet, she saw the proudHigh towers of Paris scorn an humble cloud.Ravens, and all the prophets of the air,Nightly to dormitories near repair:Amongst the rest, for twenty winters foul,In a dark cave, a Sibyl, call'd an Owl,Secur'd herself from Day's oppressing light;And fled abroad, to prophesy at Night.Of great disasters she has early sense,Is an impartial true intelligence.All sects believe her, though she joins with none;The Schismatick flies all communion.Night for her healing touch Nature enthrones,She often cures both crazy minds and bones.Kings fall'n with care below e'en common men,She re-anoints, and makes them kings again.Day wears, but Night repairs, nay makes mankind,The only labour to her reign assign'd,Therefore this Ethiop with Day dividesThe rule of time; half through her empire slides.Angry to see her reign profan'd with toil,She posted to suppress the noisy broil,And the bold authors; for the great affair,She chose this Owl her premier minister,And call'd her out; her black queen's voice she knew,To her retinue joyfully she flew.Both swiftly through th' august Cathedral past,And found the prison of the engine vast.It lay neglected in a desert room;Night plac'd her bird deep in its dusty womb.Now Trole and Minnum, two great chiefs elect,Left the Dean's vault, and the slow Verger check'd.He was as vigorous as they in mind,But age and gout detain'd him far behind.Besides, th' old tortoise carried on his backOf necessary tools a boisterous pack,As hammer, chissels, mallet, saw, and nails,Under whose weight his wasted vigour fails.The warriors force through Night's affrightful shade;Then valiantly the high proud dome invade.First they ascend to the magnific porch,Which stor'd the valued learning of the Church.The Verger stopp'd the troop, whilst, with the dintOf steel, he cut the veins of stubborn flint,And forc'd from thence a spark; the infant brightAs soon as born begot another light,Which proves to them a kind of midnight sun,By whose direction boldly they go on.Th' unfolding gates upon the troop let looseDetested shades, like floods through opening sluice.Like a bold caravan the stream they stem,The horrors and the solitude contemn,So on in wilds where never was a road,And reach at length the pulpit's dark abode.Their wonders on the fall'n machine they feast,Like birds upon the carcass of a beast." How now? said Minnum, come we here to gaze?"And then, ambitious to engross the praise,With a stiff threatening arm, and bending back,He singly made a desperate attack.Ere half his force the engine had receiv'd,(Astonishing! and scarce to be believ'd)A horrid voice out of the pulpit flew,Th' old Verger from his back his burthen threw;The fire from Trole's flaming visage stray'd,Only in his nose, as in a socket, play'd.Pale Minnum like a lily hung his head,With his lost mistress wish'd himself in bed:But, fearing shame, he put false courage on,Seem'd bolder now more danger might be won.The frightful dangerous engine shook once more,With greater resolution than before.The angry Owl, once more depriv'd of ease,Rushes abroad with greater menaces,Scattering a storm of wind and dust about,Which put their candle and their courage out.Their trembling knees could not their bodies bear;Their nerves were weaker than their staring hair.In wild confusion they slunk all away,Like truants by their whipster catch'd at play.Discord rag'd at their foil, and, in despightOf their base fear, will force them to the fight.In Boyrude's wither'd figure she appears,Aged, but worn with wrangling more than years;Wrinkled, but malice half the cyphers made,And claim to half his wasted visage laid.Her bending trunk she with a staff supports,And hastes to find her warriors' dark resorts.With broken voice, and hoarse with frequent brawl,She cries, "Where are you fled, ye cowards all?Think you, because your odious heads ye hide,Your infamy more odious is not spy'd?Come out, and shew the reason of your fear."Stung with reproof, with boldness they appear,Proud of th' encounter, and prepar'd to boast,For all of them believ'd the Owl a Ghost.Minnum was fix'd in the opinion strong;His charms had kill'd a Sempstress fair and young,Her heart was crush'd between his voice and face,The kingdom had not such a dangerous place.His voice had fix'd her in the fatal snare:She often came to gaze on him at prayer,And, when his eye was from the book releas'd,He glances shot which pierc'd her tender breast.At length, alas! she perish'd in the fray,Her ruin therefore heavy on him lay.What shape could more exactly fit her soul,Than that of an unlovely bashful Owl,Whom the wing'd Chanters drive out of their sight,And make her live in melancholy night?With these conceits they swelling came, and cram'd;Minnum for th' Owl a doleful speech had fram'd.He said, "We saw a Ghost or Goblin foul!"Reply'd the Goddess, "Goblin! a poor OwlDrives you from glory by base childish fears,This Owl has been my neighbour thirty years.Near my own house she every evening makes,And sends abroad, her nightly Almanacks.Fear you a foolish timorous Owl's grimace?How durst y' encounter then a Judge's face?Board Lawyers without sees, as I have done,And to myself immortal glory won.Judges from me could not protect the bar,Where spite of them my deeds recorded are.Oh, Sirs! the Church produc'd brave spirits then,A Sexton was as surly as a Dean;Bore wrongs as proudly, and forgave as few:The least of us would a whole Chapter sue.But the old world grows barren by degrees,And breeds no more such gallant souls as these.However, imitate their virtues great,Let not an Owl compel you to retreat.Think what dishonour on yourselves you throw,How insolent you'll make the Chanter grow:From texts he cannot borrow such control,As from the shameful story of the Owl.The thought o' th' Owl will ride you night and day;Dispirit you, though ye be ne'er so gay;Untune your voices when you'd sing your best,Russle your plumes when you are neatly drest,Your surplices, wips, cravats, set with care,E'en women will regard you less than prayer;The pews will be neglected by degrees,And the old Verger lose his Sunday fees.I hear a murmur say your spirits rise,And I see Church-like fury in your eyes.Away to honour, gather laurels fast,With present bravery hide dishonour past."This said, the warlike Goddess took her flight.And, mounting, streak'd the air with tracks of light,Which fir'd our champions hearts. The Howlard fled;A generous contempt succeeded dread.Th' affront receiv'd from the vile saucy foeOn th' engine was reveng'd by many a blow.In mournful tones the pitying organ moan'd,And the whole sympathizing temple groan'd.Ah! when this spacious wooden horse was rear'd,If thou, oh Chanter! hadst the treason heard,Thou, in defence of ecclesiastic pride,Like a true Church Apostle, would'st have dy'd;Rather great Martyr been, than Chanter small,And in red letters shine, or not at all.But sleep thou feed'st does with thy foes combine,And hug thee whilst they compass their design.For now a lofty Ecclesiastic ThroneBuries thy Bench, where thou so long hast shone.CANTO IV.NOW do the cocks begin their morning brawl,And drowsy Chanters to their mattins call.Their Chief was troubled with a frightful dream,Which made him sweat, and waken with a scream.His trembling Valets, on his second cries,Forsake their warm enticing down, and rise.But wakeful Gerot reach'd his Master first,An humble Valet, but a Verger curst.He kept the Choir on the sinister side,He crouch'd at home, but there he shew'd his pride.Mean were his common customers for pews,So in their humble bows he took his dues.Said he, "What humour drives your rest away?Will you to Church, when it is scarcely day?Sleep on; your business is to take your ease:Let vulgar Chanters earn their salaries."" Friend, said the Chanter, trembling, faint, and pale,Your mirth would die, if you knew what I ail.Insult not o'er me, but prepare to hearTh' amazing cause of my surprizing fear.When sleep had twice upon my eyes bestow'dOf drowsy poppies a fresh-gather'd load;I dreamt I fill'd my lofty Seat in prayer,Triumphing o'er the Minor Chanters there,Absolving, chanting, taking humble bows.Giving the blessing; all with frowning brows:When a great Dragon, with jaws dreadful wide,Souz'd on my Bench, and swallow'd all my pride."Then rage tongue-ty'd him; Gerot, laughing loud,Said, "Dreams were fumes from ill-concocted food;Cooks with ill sauce could every night bestowOn childish fancies such a puppet-show."The sour old man could ne'er with mirth agree,But now abhorr'd his ill-tim'd raillery:Forbad him speaking, and from bed he flings.Gerot, to calm him, his rich habit brings:Which very little could his mind sustain,For, if his Desk be hid, all those were vain.But yet their offer'd grace he will not slight;He rush'd into his gown, and surplice white.But, above all, he will not leave behind,His spacious scarlet hood, with tabby lin'd:His haughty heart would break, if he should lackThat proof of learning, to adorn his back.With his best bonnet then he grac'd his brow,Sole mark of learning his white head could shew,His purple gloves he never fail'd to wear,When he would honour much himself and prayer.And, marching now in battle to engage,Omitted no illustrious equipage.Then much beyond the weakness of his yearsPush'd on, and earliest in the Choir appears.But, oh! what spite and fury fir'd his blood,When on his Bench he saw the Pulpit stood!" Oh, Gerot see, said he, the Dragon see,Which broke my sleep, and now will swallow me.Oh, faithful Dream! thou too much truth hast shown;The Dean is an ingenious tyrant grown;By this machine, does wittily contriveTo send me to infernal shades alive.Nothing but God will ever see me here;Dark shadows will expunge my character.Ere such a horrible affront I'll bear,I'll quit my office, and the Church forswear;I'll give my vain superfluous Chantings o'er,And tire the ears of God and Man no more.I'll never toil that Deans may glory win,Nor see that Choir where I shall ne'er be seen.'Tis time enough to go to shades when dead,I'll now have light." Then his old arms he spreadWith fury strong; and shook the wondrous frame,When th' Organist and the Clock-mender came,His faithful friends. The vision struck them wan,With trembling hands they held th' old venturous man;Said they, "The work's too weighty for us all;By a full Chapter let the Monster fall,In open day; 'twill your great party shew,Strengthen yourself, and terrify the foe." Right," said the Chanter; "go, by noise or force.The sleeping Canons from their beds divorce."The Champions trembled, when beyond their thoughtTheir counsel on themselves such danger brought." Oh! moderate your anger, Sir! said they.Awaken rich fat Canons before day?Men doubly buried both in flesh and down!Th' attempt is rare, the deed was never known.Starv'd Monks a larum in their bosoms keep,Hunger, a watchful enemy to Sleep.Their thin-worn wheels are soon in motion set:But who can stir a Canon mir'd in fat?"" Deceitful cowards, th' old testy man reply'd,You fain your terror of the Dean would hide:A hundred times I've seen you croüching standWith servile necks, beneath his blessing hand.The work, good Gerot, shall by us be done,Our friends for once shall shame the loitering sun."Cunning old Gerot knew the Canons well,Spar'd his worn lungs, rung the great master-bell;Which, like the heavy Dean, but serv'd for state,And almost broke the Church with needless weight.Th' unchrist'ned bell, with sacrilegious roar,From his strong camp the God of slumbers tore;Broke open all the holy Canons eyes,And made the Devil of noise and tumult rise.Some believ'd thunder broke into the room,Others half fear'd it was the day of doom.Some Priests, less scar'd, thought 'twas a dying knell;Some keenly hungry hop'd 'twas Pancake-bell.The sound with different sense fill'd every head,Like a dark text, wondrous confusion bred.So when, to batter down a hundred walls,The thund'ring Lewis leaves the fair VersaillesTo the young Spring, not valuing her delights,And with spread banners all the world affrights;Danow to th' Euxine hastes his march to shun,Swift Rhine in great commotion hurries-on,Brussels for bursting bombs looks every hour,And Sodom-like to feel a fiery shower.Rich skirted Tagus creeps far under ground,And hides much treasure there in vaults profound.Amphibious Holland plunges deep in waves,Buries itself alive in watery graves.So under blankets the priests duck'd their heads,Sought a warm easy burial in their beds.Vexatious Gerot knew their temper well:With potent words he seconded the bell." Ho, breakfast waits!" the cunning Verger cries.At that angelic summons, all arise:In expectations of divine delights,All look their cloaths, but none their appetites,For they were ready, ere their gowns were on:Headlong undrest to the great hall they run:But, 'stead of breakfast, met a mournful tale,Told by the Chanter with great fury pale;Who, as a pestilence were in his breath,Struck mighty hunger with a sudden death.Everard a painful abstinence abhorr'd,And bad the Verger cover strait the board.To that once savoury motion no man spoke,At length learn'd Allen the deep silence broke.He only, of all the Priests our Church obey'd,Had not his Latin smother'd and o'erlaid.Others by wealth to dulness did advance,And with the Church's coin brought ignorance.But he had wander'd from that practis'd rule,And was as learn'd as when he came from school.His Roman tongue there gave him mighty power,There he was almost Roman Emperor.None in his presence durst lay claim to parts,For, if they did, his Latin stabb'd their hearts.This tyrant yet was their defence and grace:Latin was such a terror to the place,All other Canons fled at first alarmsOf men approaching with such dreadful arms.But noble Allen scorn'd his head to hide,And sturdy shocks of Latin durst abide.Most learnedly equipp'd, th' accomplish'd man,Having first cough'd, his wise harangue began:" Some Huguenots, our curst eternal foes,Planted this here, to batter our repose.In some Church History they 've read, I fear,Canons once preach'd, and Deans sat here to hear.I range in volumes, not to poach for art,But to meet Latin which delights my heart.Let us all study with what speed we may,And shew ourselves as deeply learn'd as they.About this Pulpit then let 's quickly foundAll learned men in these great things profound."Th' unlook'd-for counsel all th' assembly scar'd,But made an earthquake in fat Everard;Who shaking with astonishment and rage," How I, said he, turn school-boy in my age!Do thou look pale, and wither o'er a book,I ne'er so much as on the Bible look.I only study when our rents are due,When leases fall, and tenants should renew.Books I abhor; they fill the Church with Schisms;Much mischief we have had from Syllogisms.If to Religion you would converts make,Burn Books and Men, say I, and use a stake.I will not vex my head: my arm aloneShall, without Latin, throw this Pulpit down.I care not what Heretic Rascals say:What troubles me, I 'll throw out of my way.So let's prepare for the renown'd design,And, when accomplish'd, plentifully dine."No sooner the word Dinner pass'd their ears,Than up their stomachs rose, down fell their fears,But then the Chanter, none more bold and great,Exclaim'd, "This Tub too long has made us sweat.Do Deans fear dust? must they be cas'd like clocks?Would they like sentries awe us from a box?In our Church-pillar is some rottenness spread:To hide himself, he would be wainscoted.My vengeance on this soppery I'll throw;And an hour's fasting on the work bestow.This done, at once we 'll break our fast, and dine,And two fair meals with both their portions join."By this inspir'd, the haughty Champions goWith an audacious zeal to charge the foe.The walls vain aid to the poor Engine lent,The nails in vain their iron fingers bent;The Champions vanquish'd all resistance round,The batter'd Engine fell with many a wound.Antichrist never had such dreadful blowsFrom mighty Priests who were his bitter foes:For, as this Pulpit was, he 's wondrous high,A great Usurper of Church-vanity.Therefore have many rail'd at him aloud;He will let no man but himself be proud.Now the Dean's State, of late so high and great,Once more is in a sea of darkness set!LINES BY MR. HIGGONSSee an account of this writer, and some of his poems, vol. I. p. 125; and in this volume, p. 111. — I have since been told, that he published a poem on the Peace of Utrecht; and had some others by him, which he intended for the press. He was first cousin to the late earl Granville. Two lines of his verses on the Death of Waller, vol., I. p. 130, are evidently to be traced in the following couplet of Tickell, in the English Poets, vol. XXV. p. 188.
" Near to those chambers, where the mighty rest," Since their foundation, came a nobler guest." N., IN THE BLANK LEAF OF "THE ROYAL MISCHIEF," A TRAGEDY, BY MRS. MANLEY.THE tender boy in our cold country 's chill'd;No sooner born, but the young Cupid 's kill'd.All talk of Love, but few the passion feel,Till thy warm lines the sacred power reveal;Such mysteries of Love thy scenes convey,That 'tis Enjoyment but to read thy Play.All sex and age attend thy moving song,Which virtue brings to all; confirms the strong,Recruits the weak, and makes the dotard young.VERSES TO THE QUEEN AND PRINCE, ON THEIR VISITING OXFORD, 1702.I. TO THE QUEEN, AT CHRIST-CHURCH.SPOKEN BY MR. HARCOURTSon to Sir Simon (afterwards lord) Harcourt. This young gentleman did not succeed to the title; as he died in 1720, seven years before his father. On his tomb at Stanton Harcourt is a beautiful epitaph by Mr. Pope. He was father to the first, and grandfather to the present, earl Harcourt. N..WHEN haughty Monarchs their proud state expose,And Majesty an aweful greatness shews;Their subjects, Madam, with amazement seiz'd,Gaze at the pomp, rather surpriz'd than pleas'd.But your more gentle influence impartsWonder at once and pleasure to our hearts.Where-e'er You come, joy shines in every face;Such winning goodness, such an easy grace,Through all your realms diffusive kindness pours,That every English heart 's entirely yours.The Muses' sons with eager transport viewTheir long-desponding hopes reviv'd in You,The Muses' sons to Monarchs ever true.These happy walls, by royal bounty plac'd,Often with royal presence have been grac'd.Here Kings, to ease the cares attend a crown,Preferr'd the Muses' laurels to their own.And here You once enjoy'd a safe retreat,From noise and envy free: to this lov'd seat,To be a guest, You then did condescend;Which now, its happy guardian, You defend.Oxford, with joy, beholds the Royal Pair,And finds her Muses are her Prince's care.May we presume to claim a nearer tye?They are your Subjects, we your Family.Accept the duty then we doubly owe,We share your Presence and Protection too.So, when great Jove within the country cellOf humble pious Baucis meant to dwell,The bounteous God grac'd her with gifts divine;And, where he found his refuge, fix'd his shrine.II. TO THE PRINCE, AT CHRIST-CHURCH.SPOKEN BY MR. COWSLADEI cannot find who Mr. Cowslade was; and it is remarkable, that not one of these four Speakers took a regular degree at the University. N..AND You, auspicious Prince, our other care,Accept the duty which your Isis pays:Whether in arts of Peace, or deeds of War,The Hero justly claims the Muse's praise.Aspiring Youth, fir'd with a generous flame,The tracts of princely virtues here pursue;At once both copy and admire your fame;And all their different aims unite in You.One bloody sieges and feign'd camp designs,And fancied schemes of future actions draws,And early, in imaginary times,Defends his Country's and his Prince's cause.Others the milder arts of Phoebus chuse,And to smooth numbers form their tuneful tongue:From You begin, to You direct their Muse,The Subject and the Patron of their song.Illustrious Guests, Joint-partners in our love,Protect these arts which by your influence live.Those arts which we with loyal zeal improve,To You return the vigour they receive.Whilst Ormond, by undaunted courage led,Regions unknown and distant foes alarms;We, Ormond's care, to early duty bred,Learn here to aid your councils and your arms.III. TO THE QUEEN, AT SUPPER.BY MR. FINCHHeneage, grandson to the first earl of Nottingham. His father was created baron Guernsey, March 16, 1703; and earl of Aylesford, Oct. 26, 1714. — The speaker of these verses died earl of Aylesford, June 26, 1757; and was grand-father to the present earl. N..WITH love, though rude, we crowd this hallow'd place,And clog that triumph which we mean to grace,To view the Queen, that frees us from alarms,Secures our quiet, and directs our arms.England before its ruin'd trade deplor'd,A mourning victor and disputed lord.Now mouldering fleets in Gallic harbours lie,While British ships their double world defy.Our Muses hear the battles from afar,And sing the triumphs, and enjoy the war.This now; but soon the quivering spear they'll wield,And lead the shouting squadrons to the field.They'll serve that Princess whom before they sung,Defend that Queen beneath whose eye they sprung.So spreading oaks, from lovely Windsor born,Shall shelter Britain, which they now adorn:With swelling sails o'er distant seas they'll go,And guard that Goddefs by whose care they grow.IV. TO THE QUEEN, GOING TO BED.SPOKEN BY MR. PULTENEYThis was very likely to have been the late lord Bath; and I am sorry that it cannot be ascertained. N..MADAM, once more, th' obsequious Muse,With zeal and just ambition fir'd,Her grateful homage here renews,In numbers by Yourself inspir'd:And late her willing duty shows,To guard you to your safe repose.Within this silent humble cell,Secure the gifts of sleep receive;No factions here or discords dwell,To break that rest the Muses give.Here daily cares help to increase,Not interrupt, our mighty ease.These walls, more happy now, possestOf the most fair and shining Court,Not in the Muses, but their Guest,Theirs and the Muses' chief support.So Delphos was the bless'd abodeOf Phoebus' Priests and of the God.May Heaven its sacred charge defend!May every Grace and every Muse,Round You with watchful care attend,And balms of gentle sleep infuse!Such as the virtuous only know;Kind as the blessings You bestow!CONTENTS OF VOLUME III.THE Eagle and the Robin.
