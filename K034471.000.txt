CLEONICE, PRINCESS of BITHYNIA: A TRAGEDY.As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN COVENT-GARDEN.BY JOHN HOOLE.DUBLIN: PRINTED BY W. SPOTSWOOD, FOR THE UNITED COMPANY OF BOOKSELLERS.MDCCLXXV.PROLOGUE.Written by THOMAS VAUGHAN, EsqSpoken by Mr. BENSLEY.TELL me, ye Gods, ye arbiters of wit,Who rule the heavens, or who lead the pit, addressing the gallery and pit,Whence comes it, in an age refin'd by tasteBy science polish'd, and by judgement chaste,We see the Muse, in dignity sublime,Led on by prologue, ape-ing pantomime;Whose sportive fancy, and whose comic skill,All must applaud—where Roscius guides the quill;Yet when Melpomene in grief appears,Her suff'ring virtue bath'd in sorrow's tears,From Tyrant laws, or jealous love oppress'd,Swelling with silence in her tortur'd breast.How can the heart her genial impulse shew,Feel as she feels, or weep another's woe;When gay Thalia has so late possess'dThe laughing transports of the human breast?Let each her province keep, let jocund mirthTo Epilogue alone give happy birth;Ease the struck soul from ev'ry anxious fcar,And wipe from beauty's check the silent tear.Twice Metastasio's wings have borne our Bayes,And safely brought him o'er the critic seas;Fir'd with success, he dares this awful night,Cheer'd by your smiles to take a bolder flight;Nor longer stoop beneath a foreign shade,Like Dian shining from a borrow'd aid;But comes impregnate with Icarian pride,To stretch his pinnions, and forsake his guide;Yet doubtful flies, lest vapours damp his force,And one black cloud should stop his airy course,To awful heights his proud ambition soars,And the dread regions of applause explores;
No sun he fears—but courts its warmest ray'Tis yours to raise—or sink him in the sea.Let Candour then proceed to try the cause,That Magna Charta of dramatic laws!PROLOGUE.Written by a Friend, to have been spoken in the character of the Tragic Muse.Designed for Mrs. BARRY.JUDGES of Genius! from whose hands a bardThis night awaits the laurel of reward!To you, the Tragic Muse, in Britain's name,Comes to announce the merits of his claim.'Tis I have led him timorous to this field,And bade him dare his country's guantlet wield;Bade him aspire to vault her fiery breed,Nor humbly stoop to mount the manag'd steed.Long had I seen his patient merit toil,In culling chaplets from a foreign soil;Whilst, here, transplanted by his skilful hand,Italia's honours bloom'd in Albion's land.Long had I mark'd, as such exotic boughsContent he wove to veil his modest brows,A spirit that in paths untrod beforeMight snatch the nobler foliage of this shore.Pleas'd with the hopes, that I had now descry'dA future son, from whom the buskin's prideTo this my favourite Isle, again might rise;I touch'd his ear, and pointed out the prize."Wither my honours in this clime (I said)"Buds here no bounteous leaf to deck thy head?"Are these once fosiering skies so over-cast,"That Genius dares not brave th' inclement blast?"Come, let me lead thee, where my sons of yore"In Fancy's fields amass'd their laureate store;
"With active powers, aloft, bestrode the clouds"Inspir'd by kind acclaims of shouting crowds."Turn thee, where Shakespear wav'd the mystic rod,"And saw a new creation wait his nod."Behold where Terror, with eccentric stride,"Bursts, like a torrent from the mountain's side!"Behold where gentle pity heaves the sigh,"Sluicing the fruitful conduit of the eye!"See love at whose approach, the airy Wiles"Of Mirth and Freedom, or the jocund Smiles"Of sweet content, dispers'd in wild affright,"Mount on their silken wings and take their flight."See Jealousy his hideous form uprear,"Tine the quick brand, and shake the vengeful spear:"While, close behind, fell Anguish aud Disdain"Stalk sullen by; and swell his gloomy train."Mark where Despair points to some distant ground;"On blasted yews, where Night-birds shrick around,"Where yawning Tombs add horror to the night,"And Meteors flash their momentary light."Here mark thyself, what various objects rise,"Nor trust the medium of another's eyes.'I spoke—and Genius strait began to spreadHis ready Plumage, and my voice obey'd,Adventurous, thence he dares this night aspireTo stamp the vivid scene with native fire.'Tis yours, ye Britons, then, with kind applause,To fan the flame I kindled in your cause:Nor be it said, when on your mercy thrown,You foster every spark, but what's your own.From your dread sentence, crown'd with laurels won,I ardently expect to greet a Son:The Palm I have deposited with you,And trust your hearts to give it where 'tis due.Dramatis Personae.MEN.ARTABASUS, King of Pontus, Mr. BARRY.PHARNACES, his son, under the name of Arsetes, Mr. LEWIS.LYCOMEDES, King of Bithynia, Mr. BENSLEY.ORONTES, Prince of the blood of Bithynia, Mr. LEE.TERAMENES, General of Bithynia, Mr. HULL.AGENOR, Friend to Pharnaces, Mr. WHITEFIELD.ZOPYRUS, Friend to Orontes, Mr. L'ESTRANGE.Officer, Mr. THOMPSON.WOMEN.CLEONICE, Daughter to Lycomedes, Mrs. HARTLEY.ARSINOE, Daughter to Teramenes, Miss DAYES.Guards, Attendants, &c.SCENE, a city on the frontiers of Bithynia, and the country adjacent.CLEONICE: A TRAGEDY.ACT I.SCENE, a gallery.TERAMENES, AGENOR.TERAMENES.AGENOR, still Bithynia must retainThe sword unsheath'd, and still remov'd afar,Shall Peace, in vain desir'd, mock every hope,Of dear domestic happiness—the leaguesOf factious princes, whose associate forceHas vex'd this bleeding land, now yield indeedTo Lycomedes' arms, or rather shrinkBefore the genius of your noble friend.Agen.Arsetes, bred in distant realms, and longA wanderer o'er the face of earth, must hailThe hour that led his steps to tread your soil,And gave him Teramenes for his friend.Tera.Tho' now the rage of civil strife is past,Full well thou know'st, to-morrow's sun declin'd,His next returning beam lights up the dayThat ends the truce with Pontus, and demandsOur strongest force to meet a mightier foe,In Artabasus.Agen.Five returning sunsHave chang'd your vernal groves, since as the breathOf Fame declares, your armies met and foughtOn Hippias' banks, what time your martial powers(Forgive me, if report mislead my tongue,)Bow'd to a foreign standard.Tera.Lycomedes,Whose thirst of glory in his vigorous lifeCompell'd the neighbouring states to bend beneathBithynia's yoke; when creeping time had clogg'd
The vital springs, and kept his age from scenes,Of active valour, by his generals stillMaintain'd the field, and thro' the nations spreadHis martial terrors, till that fatal day,When Hippias, down his current, dy'd with blood,The frequent corse and glittering ensign bore:Then, midst the slaughter, fell a sacrificeTo iron war, our king's lamented son;A youth, the early darling of his sire,The soldier's hope, and nursling of the field.Agen.Oft have I heard Polemon's name, whose braveUnpractis'd arm encounter'd Artabasus,And from his sword receiv'd a glorious death.Tera.But tho' the time's necessity compell'dBithynia to the truce, still, still the thoughtOf his Polemon rankled in the bosomOf our afflicted monarch, still the hope,Tho' distant hope of vengeance, glow'd within,And fed eternal hatred in his soul.While now to Pontus' bounds, his army spreadsIts conquering legions, he forgoes the stateOf Nicomedias' palace, to resideAmidst this city, whose opposing bulwarksRise on the kingdom's edge, and dare the foe.Agen.Fame speaks your rival great, and gives the praiseOf might and wisdom to the king of Pontus;And more, 'tis said, his son, amidst the filesOf Rome's immortal legions, distant farFrom Pontus, learns the rugged trade of war,And gathers laurels in his blooming age,That veterans view with envy: his returnGives earnest of new triumphs.Tera.Let him come;Would yet Arsetes aid Bithynia's causeHis sword with brave Orontes join'd, whose handMust sway the scepter of Bithynia's realm,Might fix th' unsteady wing of victoryTo Lycomedes' bands.Agen.Orontes' valourYour sovereign deems to merit Cleonice,Whose piety forsakes the pomp of courts,The splendid ease of female life, to attend
A father's steps, amidst the clang of war.But for Arsetes, thou rememberest wellWhen first he join'd to thine his social arms,He pledg'd his faith for five returning moonsTo abide your welcome guest, and now the tenthWanes in her silver orb.Tera.What says Agenor?My mind, tho' loth, recalls each circumstance.But still I hop'd Arsetes might be wonTo breathe our friendly air, still mix'd amongBithynia's warlike sons, now hovering o'erThe verge of hostile Pontus, when the timeAnd place concurr'd to pour with sudden inroadThe storm of conquest on our hated foe,To avenge a form, a worth so like his own——But see, he comes—Enter ARSETES.Belov'd Arsetes, welcome!Youth, at thy presence, buds with bloom renew'd,Such as I was, when, on Arabia's sands,I crush'd the wandering robbers of the desert.Arse.My lord, too partial friendship ever findsNew praise for your Arsetes; if I claimOf merit aught, here Heaven receive my thanks,That bade me wield the sword for Lycomedes.Tera.And yet Arsetes now methinks forgetsTo prize our country's honours; while the bondOf friendship holds no more his changing heart;That heart, which once I press'd with transport here,Which seem'd with mutual transport to receiveThe love I proffer'd, when my bosom glow'dWith warmth of gratitude to him, whose armSnatch'd Teramenes from impending death,As fierce Lysippus aim'd the threatening bladeAt my defenceless head, when you rush'd in,(Till then unknown) and sav'd me from the foe.Ars.'Twas sure some happy star, that led my stepsAt that blest moment—if I sav'd the lifeOf Teramenes, I preserv'd indeedA faithful counsellor for Lycomedes,An army's chief, but for myself a friend.Tera.And wilt thou, my Arsetes, now forsake
The bands, that late pursued the glorious taskOf conquest, taught by thee—now when the great,Th' important moment comes, on which dependsOur monarch's fame, our vengeance—led by theeAnd brave Orontes, we have stemm'd the tideOf inbred tumult: every rebel headNow lies subdued, and flush'd with great success,Our soldiers now demand, with loud acclaim,To pour their fury o'er yon hostile bounds,Beneath Arsetes and Orontes.Arse.HeavenBe witness here, compulsive honour longHas chanlleng'd my departure—yet, till nowI wav'd obedience to the frequent callsOf duty; but the flame of civil broilsAt length subsiding thro' your troubled state,I must (forgive me, chief, forgive me, friend,)Yield to the powerful voice, and quit Bithynia.By every toil my sword has known in battle,But most the toils I shar'd with Teramenes,Unwilling and compell'd, I leave your clime,And quit a country dearer than my own.Tera.Farewell, Arsetes; think that TeramenesFeels from his in most soul the fix'd resolveOf him, whom once he fondly deem'd by fortune,From all mankind selected for his friend.I'll seek the king—no less will he regretArsetes' loss, whose presence might insureHis wish'd revenge, and fix his kingdoms glory.[Exit.ARSETES, AGENOR.Agen.Why droops Arsetes? O! discover allThy secret grief and let Agenor share it.Arse.Indeed thou dost—my every thought is thine,My other self, my bosom's counsellor!What needs there more to rend my heart, to fillMy tortur'd soul, while loitering here I wrongMy native soil, the voice of filial dutyChides my delay, yet Love, the powerful GodReigns in my breast, and mocks each settled purpose:Come, my Agenor, with thy friendly aidConfirm my thoughts, and teach me yet to tread,Yet to resume the path my seet have left;
To quit the land, where all my joys are center'd,To tear myself from love and Cleonice——O! never!—never—Agen.Yet again reflect,Think who you are, to what has Heaven reserv'dYour virtues—Shall a kingdom's heir—Arse.Go on—'Tis honest chiding—Shall a kingdom's heir,(Thus would'st thou say) on whom th' expecting eyesOf thousands look for happiness, on whomA father fixes every dearest hopeTo see himself renew'd to distant times,Shall he, forgetting all the claims of glory,Forgetting all the ties of filial duty,Defraud his longing people of their prince,And from his sire with-hold a darling son?Say—shall Bithynia's hostile lands detain,From Artabasus' sight his loved Pharnaces?O! no—Agenor—thou hast fir'd my soul;My father!—yes, I will embrace the kneesOf him, whose love reproaches my delay.Yet never, Cleonice, shall this breastForget its wonted flame:—Is it a crimeTo adore the sum of all her sex's graces,Tho' wayward chance has plac'd the hopeless barOf lineal enmity between our loves?Agen.And yet, my prince; the indulgent hand of fate,Perchance may weave your future web of lifeWith threads of brighter dye; even love itselfMay find a way to clear the gloomy prospect:Discord perhaps may once again extinguishHer hated torch that fires the rival nations,And Cleonice be the bond of peace:Too long, already, strangers have we lived,Alien from friends and home: tho' ArtabasusSent you beneath my father's guardian care,To learn hard lessons in the school of glory,Yet sure the parent suffer'd in that absence,Which, as a king, his virtue deem'd would raiseYour fame, and fit you for a people's weal.Arse.Yes, my Agenor, oft his tenderest greetingsHave warn'd me to return, when circling time
Had brought the period fix'd for my departure;Or when the pause of arms, or honour's dutyPermitted me to quit the host of Rome.Agen.And yet—my prince—Arse.And yet—too true, Agenor,I feel each just reproach—the land indeedI left, and journey'd o'er a length of soil,When fate (for sure 'twas more than common fortune)Prompted my steps to tread Bithynia's realm,Where Lycomedes wag'd intestine warWith rebel arms.Agen.Thy generous valour then,Warm'd by the common cause of kings, to assertA prince's rights, forgot thy country's foe.Arse.Full well thou know'st I vow'd to every God,By all the solemn ties that bind mankind,Ne'er to reveal, while in this hostile landMy country or my birth; this, urg'd by thee,I swore, when first I told thee my design,To gaze on Cleonice's wondrous charms.Agen.Nor vain the caution—think, O think, how farIt yet imports to keep the mighty secret:Alas! my friend, I tremble, had your fatherBeen conscious whither fortune led the stepsOf his Pharnaces; could he know the landOf Lycomedes now detains his son—Th' idea starts a thousand fears: should nowSome dreadful chance betray you to the foe;I shudder at the thought—then let us henceAnd to the longing troops of Pontus giveA blooming hero, promis'd oft in vain:Then let us hasten—by my father's shadeI now adjure you—for Pharnaces onceRever'd his Tiridates—Arse.Witness HeavenHow dear I held him!—Artabasus onlyCould claim a nearer duty o'er my heart,The guide, the great example of my youth!Methinks I now recall the fatal dayThat snatch'd him from us—O my lov'd Agenor!The scene is present to my eyes—I seeThe battle rang'd, when to my ardent gaze
His hand experienc'd pointed out the filesOf rigid war, and taught me where to driveThe thunder of the field; when Heaven so will'd,A distant arrow sent with deadly aim,Pierc'd his brave breast—Agen.Then midst the distant fight,It was not given Agenor's hand to close,A dying parent's eyes—Arse.These arms receiv'dThe venerable chief—"Take, take,"(he cry'd)"This last embrace—still let the dear remembrance"Of Tiridates' counsels move his prince,"And, for my sake, be kind to my Agenor."He could no more, but left in thee his pledgeOf truth and amity—since which my soulHas held thee ever partner of her same,Her better half, her other Tiridates![Embrace.Agen.I am indeed thy Tiridates—yes,My father, from thy seats of bliss and peace,See, how thy prince rewards thy loyal faith,And, in his love, supplies a parent's loss—And yet, forgive me, prince, thy words awakeRemembrance of that day for ever mourn'd!——My father—Arse.Go, Agenor, since my lastResolves are fix'd—provide whate'er requiresTo quit this court—to quit my Cleonice,Tho' death is in the thought!—thy pietyReproaches mine—ere yet the mounting sunWhose early ray now gilds the face of morn,Attain his mid-day seat, the camp of PontusShall see Pharnaces and Agenor.(Exit Agenor.Arse.(alone)YetBe still, my beating heart—O Cleonice!I feel her now—Instruct me every GodIn soothing speech—O! teach my lips to breatheIn gentlest sounds the fatal word—farewell.—Orontes here!—and is not this the blestThe destin'd husband of my Cleonice—I shall relapse—for if I think—distractionEnsues, and fame and peace are lost for ever![Exit.Enter ORONTES.Oron.Sure 'twas Arsetes! that malignant planet,That thwarts my course, whene'er my fiery soulWould, eagle-wing'd, stretch her aspiring flight,He soars above me still—Have I not wornThe mask of loyal faith, smooth'd o'er the darkThe sullen brow of deep design, with smilesMy heart confess'd not?—What have I not done,For thee, Ambition!—Let not pale remembranceReview the past, or paint a scene to staggerThe sickly resolution—deeds long done,That sleep secure from every mortal ken,Are but as shadows in the coward eyeOf conscience—Hence!—Orontes' soul disdainsThe phantoms of remorse.—Enter ZOPYRUS.Now, my Zopyrus—Speak; hast thou aught that claims my ear?Zop.I learnThat the young stranger, who so deeply witch'dThe madding multitude, prepares this dayTo leave Bithynia's court.Oron.It cannot be—Arsetes!—speak—what at this fated time,When war again unfolds his brazen portals,And Pontus brings to view its crested thousands;A tempting prospect yet untry'd, to proveHis sword—It cannot be!Zop.This hour AgenorDeclar'd Arsetes' purpose.Oron.Speed it, gods!Come near, Zopyrus, to thy faithful earI've oft disclos'd the secrets of my heart,Where Love, but most Ambition holds his sway.This stranger is my bane—I shrink beneathHis better Genius—even the field that onceCrown'd this good sword with honours, yields me nowBut wither'd laurels, which his brow disdains;While the blind herd on him, with full-month'd clamour,Lavish their shouts.Zop.Yet fortune has secur'dYour brightest hopes—has not our king declar'd
Orontes, next by birth, ascends the throne?Have not the assembled states confirm'd the rightOf just succession? hastening on the steepOf downward life, our king, though high in spirit,Blazing with wasting light, that soon must fail,Shall sudden sink in night, and leave to theeA glorious rising to imperial greatness!Fair Cleonice too shall bless your bed,And with her beauty smooth the toils of empire.Oron.'Tis true, the charms of Cleonice wellMight claim the tongue of rapture—yet, Zopyrus,While great Ambition's sun lights up my flame,The star of Love looks sickly at his beams.Zop.What more can crown your wish, when Happiness,In all your soul aspires to, soon shall openHer welcome arms—Mean-time the king, my lord,Esteems, and holds you high above the rankOf Nicomedia's nobles.Oron.True, Zopyrus;Spite of the tardy warmth of cautious ageI've work'd me deep in Lycomedes' foul,By more than common zeal to avenge his son.But home-bred faction, spreading thro' the land,Compell'd us to the hated truce with Pontus;Till now, nine moons elaps'd, this upstart chiefStept in to bear away the prize of armsDue to my elder sword, while TeramenesWith partial eye beheld his every deed,And idoliz'd the work himself had rais'd.Zop.Yet common rumour speaks that friendship holdsIn strongest bands Orontes and Arsetes.Oron.Even so, my friend—and policy demandsThat he, who runs the mingled race of life,Should learn to veil himself, and oft appearThe thing he is not—Zop.Should propitious FortuneRemove your rival hence—Oron.If this reportBe true, the dark eclipse that late has frown'd,No more, my friend, shall intercept my fame;The war's great field, at this auspicious time
Begun, shall not enrich a stranger's hand,But fall the harvest of Orontes' sword.Exeunt.ACT II.SCENE, A garden, with palm-trees, olives, and other Eastern plants.CLEONICE,alone.ALAS! it will not be! and fond remembranceIn vain recals the past—where, where is nowThat reason's boast, which o'er creation liftsThe pride of man, when fickle as the galeThat sweeps the blossom from the bough, our passionsVeer with each hour, and shake our best resolves?How is my bosom chang'd!—no longer now,From my example, mothers teach the youngAnd tender maid, who dreads each swelling waveThat heaves but gently o'er the stream of life,To rise superior to her sex's weakness—Enter ARSINOE.Arsi.Friend of my life, whose partial choice has givenArsinöe long the privilege to passThe ceremonious bounds, which birth and titleHad plac'd between us, wherefore art thou chang'dFrom her that lov'd, and lov'd but her Arsinöe?Cleo.Still art thou here the partner of my heart;Then wherefore this reproach? and why complainOf change that never yet this breast has known?We were two plants that grew in friendship's soil,And promis'd fruits of never-dying love.Arsi.Then every care that Cleonice knewArsinöe too has shar'd—but late I've mark'dThat Cleonice, different from herself,Shuns even Arsinöe's presence, ever seeksThe lone recess, and brooding o'er her thoughts,Nurses some hidden grief—soon war againShall loose its rage—perhaps the threatening dangerAlarms your fear.Cleo.Thou know'st that I aloneRemain'd the comfort of a father's age,When fate, that tore Polemon from the hope
Of his Bithynia, from a husband's armsA hapless consort sever'd, thou remember'st,My mother, sad Arete, bow'd with grief,Soon mix'd her ashes with the son's she mourn'd:Then left, in early youth, my converse oftSooth'd a fond parent's pangs, when recollectionRais'd up the form of blessings lost for ever!While, as I grew, paternal fondness sawWith partial eye his Cleonice's mindExpand beyond her sex: hence not alone,The soft, the winning talents, that to lifeGive female polish, but the greater artsEnnobling man were taught my ripening age.But, o'er the rest, my sire, whose bosom glow'dT'avenge his son, enur'd my thoughts to cherishDeep hatred of the soe by whom he fell.Arsi.Hatred and vengeance ill agree, my friend,With tender grief like thine—estrang'd from allThy wonted temper, solitude bespeaksFar other change—Then seek not to deceiveThe searching eye of friendship.Cleo.Alas! Arsinöe,I feel the woman here—thou said'st but nowThat war again must soon unloose its rage;Is there no cause for fear? whate'er the tongueOf stoic fortitude may boast, the mind,The generous mind that owns life's dearest ties,Will nourish feelings pride disdains to own.Arsi.Revolve our present state, our country's sword,Now us'd to victory gives high expectanceOf future triumphs, while for you, my friend,If love, if grandeur charm, Bithynia's throneShall raise you high, and Hymen light his torchAt Cupid's flame—Is not the first of men,The first of heroes, yours? Yes, Cleonice,Each anxious doubt shall fleet like morning mist,And all be lost in your Orontes' arms.Cleo.Orontes' arms!—O Heaven! what have I said!By every tie of love—But whither—whitherNow rove my thoughts!—Leave me, leave me, my Arsinöe,To brood in secret o'er my treasur'd sorrows.Arsi.Scarce from her tenth fair crescent has the moonSilver'd night's fleecy robe, since I've beheld,Tho' silent, I've beheld thy alter'd mien;Methinks ere since the day, when 'midst the ranksOf rebel arms my father 'scap'd with life.Sav'd by the gallant aid of brave Arsetes—Ha! thou art pale—and now the mantling bloodReturns once more—What can this mean?—My heartHas caught the alarm, and, Oh! my soul forebodesDistress and anguish to my hopeless love.(aside.Cleo.It must be so—hence, every vain respect!I can no more dissemble—Heat, Arsinöe,Hear then and pity Cleonice's weakness!While Lycomedes with a monarch's care,Plans future schemes of greatness—Cleonice,Lost to herself, her rank, her sex's glory,Doats on the merits of a youth unknown!Arsi.Orontes then—Cleo.Orontes!—name him not—I own his worth—I own the sacred rightsA king and father claim—but I must own,Tho' while I speak, confusion fills my soul,Arsetes bears down all; and tho' the prideOf fortune rais'd me high above his hopes,A pleader here, which nothing could withstand,By looks, by deeds, by all that can ennobleThe pride of youthful manhood, had prepar'dMy easy bosom to receive the guest,That nw, sole tyrant, reigns my bosom's lord!Arsi.Then am I lost indeed!(aside.Cleo.Go, my Arsinöe,And learn if aught is rumour'd that pertainsTo my Arsetes:—soon this favourd heroWill leave Bithynia's court—but still rememberVeil'd in thy faithful breast to keep my secret:To thee I trust my life, my fame, my all!

[to Ter.]—Sir,I confess the virtuesOf my Arsinöe, and her beauty's charms:Permit me yet to ask you, if ArsetesHas e'er reveal'd—Perhaps some distant fair,Whose love and beauty had possess'd his soul,Impels him to forsake Bithynia's court.Ter.No, princess—if this judgment, not unskill'dIn human kind, can read the thoughts of men,He loves Arsinöe: late have I observ'dHis bosom labouring with the stifled passion,
Of recent birth; and well I know my daughterOwns, with a virgin blush, Arsetes' virtues:Nor could a youth, whose fortune only restsIn his own merits and his sword, refuseThat hand which Nicomedia's noblest peersWith transport would receive.Lyc.Why droops my daughter?Still cherish hope; a train of better daysSucceeds, where vengeance brightens up the prospect.My age's darling!
