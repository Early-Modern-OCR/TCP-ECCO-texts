CREÜSA, Queen of ATHENS.A TRAGEDY.As it is Acted at the Theatre Royal in Drury-lane By His MAJESTY's Servants.WRITTEN BY Mr. WILLIAM WHITEHEAD.LONDON: Printed for R. and J. DODSLEY in Pall-mall; and Sold by M. COOPER in Peter-noster-Row. 1754.PROLOGUE.Spoken by Mr. ROSS.PROLOGUES of old, the Learn'd in Language say,Were merely Introductions to the Play,Spoken by Gods, or Ghosts, or Men who knewWhate'er was previous to the Scenes in view;And complaisantly came to lay before yeThe several Heads, and Windings of the Story.But modern Times and British Rules are such,Our Bards beforehand must not tell too much;Nor dare we, like the neighb'ring French, admitEv'n Confidantes, who might instruct the Pit,By asking Questions of the leading Few,And hearing Secrets, which before they knew.Yet what we can to help this antique PieceWe will attempt.—Our Scene to-night is Greece.And, by the Magic of the Poet's Rod,This Stage the Temple of the Delphic God!Where Kings, and Chiefs, and Sages came of old,Like modern Fools, to have their Fortunes told;And Monarchs were enthron'd, or Nations freed,As an old Priest, or wither'd Maid decreed.Yet think not all were equally deceiv'd,Some knew, more doubted, many more believ'd.In short, these Oracles, and witching RhimesWere but the pious Frauds of ancient Times;Wisely contriv'd to keep Mankind in awe,When Faith was Wonder, and Religion Law!Thus much premis'd, to every feeling BreastWe leave the Scenes themselves to tell the rest.—Yet something sure was to the Critics said,Which I forget,—some Invocation made!Ye Critic Bands, like jealous Guardians, plac'dTo watch th' Encroachments on the Realms of Taste,From you our Author would two Boons obtain,Not wholly diffident, nor wholly vain:Two things he asks; 'tis modest sure, from youWho can do all things, to request but two:First to his Scenes a kind Attention pay,Then judge!—with Candor judge—and we obey.Persons Represented.XUTHUS, King of Athens, Mr. BERRY.ILYSSUS, an unknown Youth, At∣tendant on the Temple at Delphi, Miss MACKLIN.ALETES, a Grecian Sage, Mr. GARRICK.PHORBAS, an old Athenian, Mr. MOSSOP.Priests of Apollo.Citizens of Athens.CRĖU̇SA, Queen of Athens, Mrs. PRITCHARD.PYTHIA, Priestess of Apollo, Miss HAUGHTON.LYCEA, and other Women at∣tending on the Queen, Mrs. COWPER, &c.Virgins belonging to the Temple.Guards, &c.Scene, the Vestibule of the Temple of Apollo at Del∣phi, and the Laurel Grove adjoining.TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE GEORGE BUSSY, Lord Visc. VILLIERS, The following TRAGEDY is inscribed by His Lordship's Most obliged and most affectionate humble Servant,W. WHITEHEAD.Advertisement.THE Subject of the following Scenes is so ancient, so slight∣ly mentioned by Historians, and so fabulously treated by Euripides in his Tragedy of Ion, that the Author thought himself at liberty to make the Story his own. Some glaring Circumstances he was obliged to ad∣here to, which he has endeavoured to render probable.CRĖU̇SA, Queen of ATHENS. A TRAGEDY.ACT I. The Vestibule of the Temple.ILYSSUS and Virgins.ILYSSUS.HASTE, haste, ye Virgins; round the Columns twineYour flowery Chaplets; and with Streams fresh-drawnOf Castaly, bedew the sacred PorchOf the great God of Day. Already seeHis orient Beam has reach'd the double TopOf high Parnassus, and begins to shedA gleamy Lustre o'er the Laurel Grove!Haste, haste, ye Virgins. From the Vale beneathI hear the Noise of Chariots, and of SteedsWhich hither bend their Course, for every SoundSeems nearer than the former.—And beholdA reverend Stranger, who perhaps proclaimsTh' Approach of some great Monarch, to consultAll-seeing Phoebus, or implore his Aid.Haste, haste, ye Virgins!Enter PHORBAS.PHORBAS.Tell me, gentle Maids,And thou, fair Youth, who seem'st to lead the Train,Is this the Temple of the Delphic God?ILYSSUS.It is; and on the middle Point of EarthIts firm Foundations by immortal HandsStand fix'd:—but break we off; the folded GatesUnbar, and lo! the Priestess' self appears!The Pythia speaks as she descends from the TemplePYTHIA.Hence, ye profane! nor with unhallow'd StepPollute the Threshold of the Delian KingWho slew the Python!—Say, from whence thou art,And what thy Business, Stranger.PHORBAS.Sacred Maid!From Athens am I come, the HarbingerOf great Creusa, mine and Athens' QueenPYTHIA.Comes she on pious Purpose, to adoreThe mystic Shrine oracular?PHORBAS.She does;And with her comes the Partner of her Bed,Aeolian Xuthus: he whose powerful ArmSav'd Athens from her Fate, and in returnFrom good Erectheus' bounteous Hand receiv'dHis Daughter and his Crown.—
Half aside. Would he had foundSome other Recompence!PYTHIA.Overhearing him.Would he had found?Old Age is talkative, and I may learnSomewhat of moment from him.—Wherefore come they?Does Famine threaten, or wide-wasting PlagueInfest the Land?PHORBAS.Thank Heaven, our crouded StreetsHave felt no dire Disease; and Plenty stillLaughs in our blooming Fields. Alas! I fearThe childless Goddess who presides o'er AthensHas found a surer Method to declareHow ill she brooks that any Stranger HandShould wield th' Athenian Scepter.PYTHIA.Does from herThe Vengeance come?PHORBASI know not whence it comes,But this I know, full fifteen Years have roll'dSince first their Hands were join'd, and roll'd in vain;For still the Royal Pair in Silence mourn,Curs'd with a barren Bed. For this they come,T'explore the latent Cause, and beg of Heav'nTo grant an Heir, or teach them where to fix,On what selected Head, th' Athenian Crown.PYTHIA.And Heaven, no doubt, will hear and grant their Prayer.Ilssus, haste, and bid the Priests prepareFor Sacrifice. You, Nysa, and your Sisters,Amid the Laurel Grove with Speed performThe Morning's due Lustration.Then hither all return.—Myself mean while
Aside.Will tempt the Vice of Age, and try to draw
Aside.Some useful Secrets from him.
Aside.The good KingOf whom you spake, Erectheus, did his PeopleEsteem and love him as they ought? for FameTalk'd largely of his Worth. He was a King—PHORBAS.He was my good old Master, such a KingAs Heaven but rarely sends. Did we esteemAnd love him, dost thou ask? O, we ador'd him,He was our Father, not our King.—These TearsAt least may speak my Heart.—We must not hopeIn these degenerate Times to see him equall'd.He never did an unkind Act, but once,And then he thought the public Good requir'd it;Tho' much I fear the Evils we lamentFrom thence derive their Origin.PYTHIA.What Act?What unkind Act?PHORBAS.O Maid, 'twere long to tellThe whole unhappy Story, yet in partHear what to me appears too closely join'dWith these our present Ills. There was a YouthAthenian born, but not of Royal Blood,His Name Nicander; him unlucky FateHad made the Lover of our present QueenWhile yet a Maid. What will not Love attemptIn young ambitious Minds? he told his Pain,And won the Fair in secret to admit,And to return his Passion. The good KingWas for a Time deceiv'd, but found at lastTh' audacious Fraud, and drove the guilty YouthTo Banishment perpetual. Some say'Twas by his Means he fell, tho' that my HeartConsents not to believe. Thus much is sure,Nicander wander'd forth a wretched Exile,And ere few Days had past, upon the RoadWere found his well-known Garments stain'd with Blood.Sure Sign of Murder, and as sure a SignNo needy Robber was the Instrument.PYTHIA.How bore Creusa this?PHORBAS.At first her SorrowsWere loud and frantic. Time at length subduedHer Rage to silent Grief. The good old King,To sooth her Woes, consented she should raiseA Tomb to her Nicander; and performA Kind of annual Rites to parted Love.PYTHIA.But that not long continued, for we findShe married Xuthus.PHORBAS.'Twas a Match of State,He sav'd her Country, and she gave her HandBecause that Country ask'd it. But her HeartIs buried with Nicander. Still to him,And Xuthus' self permits it, she performsHer yearly Oft'rings, and adorns with FlowersAn empty Tomb.—Would he had liv'd, and reign'dHer wedded Lord! we had not wanted thenTh' Assistance of a Stranger Arm to guardTh' Athenian State, nor had we then been drivenTo search for Heirs at Delphi.PYTHIA.Stop thy Tongue,Or speak with Rev'rence of the sacred Shrine.—Thy Words were hasty, but thy Silence nowMakes just Atonement for them.—Then perhapsThou think'st this want of Heirs a Curse entail'dBy Heaven on Athens for Nicander's DeathAnd Xuthus' Reign?PHORBAS.I am Athenian born,Nor love Aeolian Kings, however greatAnd good they may be.PYTHIA.The Imperial XuthusIs much renown'd.PHORBAS.Is virtuous, brave, and pious;Perhaps too pious.PYTHIA.How!PHORBAS.Forgive me, Maid,I speak my Thoughts with Freedom.PYTHIA.What thou speak'stTo me, is sacred. Then perchance thou rank'stHis Journey hither to address the GodAmong those Acts which thou would'st call too pious?PHORBAS.For me the Gods of Athens would suffice.—Yet do I pay just Rev'rence, holy Maid,To thee, and to thy Shrine.PYTHIA.Thy Zeal for AthensIs too intemperate.—But the Train returnsAnd interrupts our Converse. Say, Ilyssus,Are they prepar'd?Enter ILYSSUS and Virgins.ILYSSUS.They are, and only waitTh' approaching Victims.PYTHIA.By you Train, the QueenIs now on her Arrival. Thou, Ilyssus,Receive her here; while I, as Custom wills,Deep in the Temple's inmost Gloom retireAnd wait th' inspiring God.—Ilyssus, hear;When thou hast paid due Honours to the Queen,Haste to Aletes, in the Laurel GroveImpatient I expect him; tell him, Youth,Things of uncommon Import do demandHis instant Presence.—But the Croud approaches.Stranger, farewel.—I feel, I feel withinAn Heav'n-born Impulse, and the Seeds of TruthAre lab'ring in my Breast.—Stranger, farewel.The Pythia returns to the Temple, and the Gates shut.Enter CREUSA and Attendants.CREUSA.No farther need we Conduct. Bid the GuardsReturn, and wait the King.PHORBAS.Does ought of MomentDetain him on the Road?CREUSA.He stops a while great Trophonius' Cave, that he may leave Duty unperform'd. Heaven grant his ZealMay meet with just Success!ILYSSUS.Please you, great Queen,In yon Pavilion to repose, and tasteSome light Refection.CREUSA.Ha!—Lycea,—Phorbas,What Youth is this? There's something in his Eyes,His Shape, his Voice.—What may we call thee, Youth?ILYSSUS.The Servant of the God, who guards this Fane.CREUSA.Bear'st thou no Name?ILYSSUS.Ilyssus, gracious Queen,The Priests and Virgins call me.CREUSA.Ha! Ilyssus!That Name's Athenian. Tell me, gentle Youth,Art thou of Athens then?ILYSSUS.I have no Country,Nor know I whence I am.CREUSA.Who where thy Parents?Thy Father, Mother?ILYSSUS.Ever honor'd Queen,I never knew a Mother's tender Cares▪Nor heard th' Instructions of a Father's Tongue.CREUSA.How cam'st thou hither?ILYSSUS.Eighteen Years are pastSince in the Temple's Portal I was foundA sleeping Infant.CREUSA.Eighteen Years! good Heaven!That fatal Time recalls a Scene of Woe—Let me not think.—Were there no Marks to shewFrom whom or whence thou wert?ILYSSUS.I have been toldAn Osier Basket such as Shepherds weave,And a few scatter'd Leaves were all the BedAnd Cradle I could boast.CREUSA.Unhappy Child!But more, O ten times more unhappy theyWho lost perhaps in thee their only Offspring!What Pangs, what Anguish must the Mother feel,Compell'd, no doubt, by some disastrous Fate——But this is all Conjecture.—ILYSSUS.O great Queen,Had those from whom I sprung been form'd like thee;Had they e'er felt the secret Pangs of Nature,They had not left me to the desart WorldSo totally expos'd. I rather fearI am the Child of Lowliness and Vice,And happy only in my Ignorance.—Why should she weep? O if her Tears can fallFor even a Stranger's but suspected Woes,How is that People blest where she presidesAs Mother, and as Queen!—Please you, retire?CREUSA.No, stay. Thy Sentiments at least bespeakA gen'rous Education. Tell me, Youth,How has thy Mind been form'd?ILYSSUS.In that, great Queen,I never wanted Parents. The good PriestsAnd pious Priestess, who with Care sustain'dMy helpless Infancy, left not my YouthWithout Instruction. But O, more than all,The kindest, best good Man, a neighb'ring SageWho has known better Days, tho' now retir'dTo a small Cottage on the Mountain's Brow,He deals his Blessings to the simple SwainsIn Balms and powerful Herbs. He taught me ThingsWhich my Soul treasures as its dearest Wealth,And will remember ever. The good Priests,'Tis true, had taught the same, but not with halfThat Force and Energy; Conviction's selfDwelt on Aletes' Tongue.CREUSA.Aletes, said'st thou?Was that the good Man's Name?ILYSSUS.It is, great Queen,For yet he lives, and guides me by his Counsels.CREUSA.What did he teach thee?ILYSSUS.To adore high Heaven,And venerate on Earth Heaven's Image, Truth!To feel for others Woes, and bear my ownWith manly Resignation. — Yet I ownSome things he taught me which but ill agreeWith my Condition here.CREUSA.What things were those?ILYSSUS.They were for Exercise, and to confirmMy growing Strength. And yet I often told himThe Exercise he taught resembled muchWhat I had heard of War. He was himselfA Warrior once.CREUSA.And did those Sports delight thee!ILYSSUS.Great Queen, I do confess my Soul mix'd with them.Whene'er I grasp'd the Osier-platted Shield,Or sent the mimic Javelin to its Mark,I felt I know not what of Manhood in me.But then I knew my Duty, and repress'dThe swelling Ardor. 'Tis to Shades, I cried,The Servant of the Temple must confineHis less ambitious, not less virtuous Cares.CREUSA.Did the good Man observe, and blame thy Ardor?ILYSSUS.He only smil'd at my too forward Zeal;Nay seem'd to think such Sports were necessaryTo soften what he call'd more rig'rous Studies.CREUSA,—Why should she weep? O if her Tears can fallFor even a Stranger's but suspected Woes,How is that People blest where she presidesAs Mother, and as Queen!—Please you, retire?CREUSA.No, stay. Thy Sentiments at least bespeakA gen'rous Education. Tell me, Youth,How has thy Mind been form'd?ILYSSUS.In that, great Queen,I never wanted Parents. The good PriestsAnd pious Priestess, who with Care sustain'dMy helpless Infancy, left not my YouthWithout Instruction. But O, more than all,The kindest, best good Man, a neighb'ring SageWho has known better Days, tho' now retir'dTo a small Cottage on the Mountain's Brow,He deals his Blessings to the simple SwainsIn Balms and powerful Herbs. He taught me ThingsWhich my Soul treasures as its dearest Wealth,And will remember ever. The good Priests,'Tis true, had taught the same, but not with halfThat Force and Energy; Conviction's selfDwelt on Aletes' Tongue.CREUSA.Aletes, said'st thou?Was that the good Man's Name?ILYSSUS.It is, great Queen,For yet he lives, and guides me by his Counsels.CREUSA.What did he teach thee?ILYSSUS.To adore high Heaven,And venerate on Earth Heaven's Image, Truth!To feel for others Woes, and bear my ownWith manly Resignation. — Yet I ownSome things he taught me which but ill agreeWith my Condition here.CREUSA.What things were those?ILYSSUS.They were for Exercise, and to confirmMy growing Strength.

Youth, farewel,I see the Place, and will retire at leisure.Lycea, Phorbas, stay.ILYSSUS.Aside.How my Heart beats!She must mean something sure. Tho' good AletesHas told me polished Courts abound in Falshood.But I will bear the Priestess' Message to him,And open all my Doubts.Exit.PHORBAS.Great Queen, why stand'st thou silent? something seemsTo labour in thy Breast.CREUSA.Alas! good Phorbas,Didst thou observe that Youth? When first my EyeGlanc'd on his beauteous Form, methought I sawThe Person of Nicander.PHORBAS.Gracious Queen,Your Heart misleads your Eyes. The Image thereToo deeply six'd makes every pleasing ObjectBear some Resemblance to itself.CREUSA.Lycea,And yet, tho' thou wast there I well believeThy Youth can scarce remember how he look'd,When from the Fight triumphant he return'dGrac'd with the victor Laurel; such a WreathAs now Ilyssus wears. Indeed, Lycea,Thy Mother, had she liv'd, had thought as I do.Nay when he spake the Voice too was Nicander's.I know not what to think, perhaps 'twas Fancy,Perhaps 'twas something more.PHORBAS.Illustrious Queen,You do abuse your noble Mind, and lendTo mere illusions of the Brain, the ForceAnd Power to make you wretched. Grant there wereSome slight Resemblance of Nicander's FormIn young Ilyssus, tho' my Eyes perceive notEven the most distant Likeness, grant there were,Yet wherefore should the Sight so nearly touch thee,Casual Similitude, we know too wellNicander left no Heir.She seems disturbed.I say not this,Great Queen, to heighten but relieve your Sorrows,And banish from your Breast each vain SurmiseWhich Fancy might suggest.CREUSA.Too well indeed,O Phorbas, much too well indeed we knowNicander left no Heir to his Perfections,No Image of himself.—And yet, good Phorbas,Blame not my Folly, nor demand a ReasonIf I intreat thee to examine strictlyThe Fortunes of this young Unknown. The PriestsOr Priestess may know more than they entrustTo his unwary Youth. The Sage he spake of,Could'st thou not search him out; 'tis somewhere nearHe dwells, I think, upon the Mountain's Brow.Thou wonder'st at me, call it if thou pleaseA Woman's Weakness; but obey me, Phorbas.PHORBAS.You say I wonder, 'tis indeed to seeMy honor'd Queen employ her Thoughts thus idlyOn Griefs long past; when things of dear ConcernTo her and Athens should alarm her nearly.CREUSA.What things of near Concern?PHORBAS.See'st thou not, Queen,Thy Crown, Erectheus' Crown, the Crown of Athens,Wav'ring in Fortune's Power?CREUSA.The Gods will fix it.PHORBAS.The Gods? Ah, great Creusa, may my FearsBe vain and groundless; but I fear the GodsHave left us to ourselves. When we resign'dTh' Athenian Scepter to a Stranger HandWe did reject their Guidance. Wherefore come weTo Delphi now, but that th' offended GodsHave turn'd too long an inattentive EarTo our ill-judg'd Petitions.CREUSA.Why ill-judg'd?We ask'd for Heirs.PHORBAS.We did; for Xuthus' Heirs,The Race of Aeolus.—I know, great Queen,They were to spring from thee; but Heaven permits notThe native Pureness of th' Athenian SoilShould mix with foreign Clay. I wish we find notMore alien Kings at Delphi.CREUSA.Think'st thou XuthusDeceives us then? His Worth, his Piety,Forbid the Thought. Besides, the sacred PlaceAdmits not of Deceit.PHORBAS.CredulityIs not the Vice of Age. Forgive me, Queen,If I suspect that Piety which brings usTo search for Kings at Delphi. Might not AthensHave chosen her own Monarch? Her brave Youth,Her bearded Sages, are they not the FlowerAnd Pride of Greece? Nay, might'st not thou, Creusa,With liberal Hand bestow th' Imperial Wreath?And who has better Right?CREUSA.The Gods, who gave itTo me, and my great Ancestors.PHORBAS.Whate'erThe Gods bestow can never be resum'dTho' we repent. The pious PopulaceWill rev'rence Kings from Heaven.CREUSA.And wherefore not?PHORBAS.O Queen, perhaps my Fears are too officious,But let thy Servant beg—CREUSA.I know thy ZealFor me, and for thy Country. Rest assur'd,Creusa never will consent to oughtWhich can endanger Athens.PHORBAS.My Heart thanks thee!CREUSA.Mean while the Youth Ilyssus—PHORBAS.Should the KingConfirm'd by Oracles presume to fixA Stranger on the Throne.—CREUSA.He will not do it.PHORBAS.I hope he will not, yet—CREUSA.The Youth I spake of,Wilt thou enquire?—PHORBAS.Should Xuthus lay asideHis usual Mildness, and assume at onceThe Monarch and the Husband, could'st thou then —CREUSA.In Athens' Cause I could resist them all.But cease these vain Suspicions. A few HoursWill prove thy Fears were groundless. Meanwhile, PhorbasThou wilt find Methods to inform thyselfTouching this unknown Youth.PHORBAS.By yonder GuardsThe King should be at hand.CREUSA.I will retireTo the Pavilion, and expect him there.Yet hear me, Phorbas; let not Xuthus knowWhy thou enquir'st.PHORBAS.Xuthus has other Cares.CREUSA.The Priestess too, I would confer with her.Tho' that Lycea may perform. Farewel,And prosper in thy Task. — Alas, Lycea,Exit Phorbas.There is a Secret labours in my Breast,But Fate forbids that I should give it Utterance.This boding Heart was early taught to feelToo sensibly; each distant Doubt alarms it;It starts at Shadows.—But retire we, Maid,Grief is th' unhappy Charter of our Sex;The Gods who gave us readier Tears to shedGave us more Cause to shed them.Exeunt.The End of the First ACT.ACT II. The Laurel Grove.ALETES and ILYSSUS.ALETES.SEEM'D she disturb'd when she beheld thee?ILYSSUS.Much;And when I gave her the slight Hints I knewRelating to my Fortunes, she dissolv'dIn silent Tears: such soft HumanitySure never dwelt in any Breast but hers.Nor did I think till now that I had CauseOf Discontent; but since she wept my Fate,I seem to find a Reason in her Grief,And feel myself unhappy.ALETES.Why unhappy?ILYSSUS.I know not why; and yet to be confin'dThus to a single Spot; to draw in Air,To take in Nourishment, to live, to die,For this was Man design'd? Ah, good Aletes,Sure thou hast taught me, Godlike Man was madeFor nobler Purposes of general Good;For Action, not for Rest.—The Queen propos'dI should attend her to th' Athenian State;Would'st thou advise it? Do'st thou think, Aletes,She meant I should attend her?ALETES.Doubtless, Youth,If she propos'd, she meant it.ILYSSUS.And would'st thouAdvise I should attend her?ALETES.Wherefore not?ILYSSUS.May I desert these Shades? or can I leaveThee, thee, my good Aletes?ALETES.O Ilyssus,Strive not to hide thy Heart; from me thou can'st not;I form'd it, and I know it. Delphi's ShadesHave now no Peace for thee, thy Bosom feelsAmbition's active, unrelenting Fires.Thou wishest, and thou hop'st, thou know'st not what.'Tis Glory thou would'st have: Go then, brave Youth,Where Virtue calls thee: be the Means but nobleThou can'st not soar too high.ILYSSUS.My more than Father!Thy Words inspire me, and I feel a WarmthUnknown before.—But then, my Birth—ALETES.Thy Birth?Did I not early teach thee to despiseA casual Good? Thou art thyself, Ilyssus.Inform me, Youth, would'st thou be what thou art,Thus fair, thus brave, thus sensibly aliveTo Glory's finest Feel; or give up all,To be descended from a Line of Kings,The tenth perhaps from Jove?—I see thy CheekGlows a repentant Blush.—Our greatest Heroes,Those Gods on Earth, those Friends of Human kind,Whose great Examples I would set before thee,Were once unknown like thee. And yet, if BirthConcern thee, know, prophetic is my Speech,Thy Fate is now at work, and a few HoursMay show thee what thou art.—My Words alarm thee.ILYSSUS.They do indeed. O tell me—ALETES.'Tis in vainThou would'st enquire from me, what Heaven concealsTill its fit Time. Didst thou not say, Ilyssus,Thy Pythia would be here?ILYSSUS.She comes.ALETES.RetireAnd leave us to ourselves.ILYSSUS.I will.—And yetMight I not know—ALETES.From me thou can'st know nothing.ILYSSUS.A few Hours, said you?ALETES.Hence, and beg of HeavenTo prosper the Event. Retire and leave us.Exit Ilyssus.Enter PYTHIA.PYTHIA.Now good Aletes, if thy pregnant Mind,Deep judging of Events, has ever fram'dSuch artful Truths as won believing ManTo think them born of Heaven, and made my NameRenown'd in Greece, O now exert thy Power.No common Cause demands it. Kings and StatesAre our Solicitors, and Athens' FateHangs on my Lips.ALETES.I know it well. And nowIf, as thou say'st, my secret kind Advice,And worn Experience in the Ways of Men,Have gain'd thy Altars Credit, and with GiftsLoaded thy Shrines, now, by one grateful ActThou may'st repay me all.PYTHIA.What Act? O speak,And gladly I obey.ALETES.An Act, my PYTHIA,Which tho' at first it may seem bold and dangerous,Shall in the End add Lustre to thy Shades,And make ev'n Kings Protectors of thy Fane.—O Pythia, 'twas the Hand of Heaven itselfWhich brought these Royal Suppliants to thy Shrine.I could unfold a Tale.—But let it rest.Thou shalt ere Night know all, and bless with meTh' indulgent Powers above. Only in thisObey me blindly, Pythia.PYTHIA.Say in what.ALETES.Declare Ilyssus Heir to Athens' Crown.PYTHIA.Ilyssus Heir? what mean'st thou? 'tis a FraudToo palpable.ALETES.I knew 'twould startle thee.But 'tis because thou know'st the Fraud, my Pythia,That it alarms thee. Didst thou really thinkThis Youth were Heir to the Athenian Crown,Would'st thou not seize the happy Gift of ChanceAnd to the World proclaim it?PYTHIA.True, I should;And bless my Fate that in these sacred ShadesI had nurs'd up unknowingly a KingFor my Protector. But what then might seemThe Consequence, now seems the Cause, Aletes;Will they not say I made the King, to gainThe kind Protector?ALETES.So to thee it seems;But who will say it? the believing manyWill bow with Rev'rence and implicit FaithTo what thy Shrine ordains; and for the fewWho may suspect the Cheat, true PolicyWill keep them silent: should they dare detectA Fraud like this, and spurn at Right divine,Where were their Power? The many-headed BeastWould feel the slacken'd Rein, and from his BackShake off the lordly Rider. Nay should AthensBe blind to her own Good, the States of Greece,Thou know'st it well, would arm in thy Defence,And force her to receive the King thou gav'st her.His Form, his unknown Birth, his winning Softness,His Education here in Heaven's own Eye,All plead in his behalf. And, as he tells me,The Queen already with unusual MarksOf Favour has beheld him. For the King,A pious Awe and Rev'rence for the GodsIs his distinguish'd Attribute. Thou seem'stTo weigh my Words. To clear thy Doubts at once,Know many Days have past since first I knewOf their Approach. Thou think'st I should have told thee,It needed not. I have myself prepar'dEach previous Circumstance, and found due meansTo forward the Event. Thy Part is easy;Behold the Oracle.PYTHIA reads."A banish'd Youth is Athens' Cause of Woe."How know'st thou that?Looking earnestly at him.ALETES.Demand not, but read on.PYTHIA reads."For that Youth banish'd, Athens must receive"Another Youth; and on the young Unknown"Who 'tends my Shrine, and whom I call my Son,"Bestow th' Imperial Wreath." The God declare"No more."ALETES.Thou seem'st amaz'd.PYTHIA.I am indeed,To find thee thus instructed on a ThemeI came prepar'd to mention. The Queen's Passion,Her Lover banish'd—ALETES.What thou seest I knowMay tell thee I know more But say, from whenceThou gained'st thy Intelligence?PYTHIA.From oneWhose Zeal may thwart thy Schemes: a warm old Man,And firm in Athens' Cause, who came to-dayBefore the rest, and led by my EnquiriesGave me those Hints on which I thought to buildProphetic, doubtful Answers. But I findMy best Instructor here.ALETES.Perhaps thou do'st.Of this rest well assur'd, I ne'er had ask'dOf Pythia ought but what I knew with SafetyShe might comply with.PYTHIA.Tell me what thou know'st.ALETES.Not yet; 'tis better thou remain in IgnoranceTill all be finish'd. But pronounce the Oracle,And leave the rest to me. Do'st thou distrust me?PYTHIA.I do not.—Yet if on slight Hints aloneThou form'st this weighty Fraud, consider wellWhat may or may not follow.—By thy LooksThere should be something hid.—Thy coming hitherWas much upon the Time we found this Child.And since, with what almost paternal CareThou hast instructed him. Tho' that indeedMight spring from thy Benevolence of Heart,Which I have known is boundless. Say, Aletes,What should I think? Thou smil'st.ALETES.Wilt thou obey me?PYTHIA.I must; and yet if 'tis a Fraud, Aletes,The warm old Man of whom I spake detestsA Stranger King. Ev'n Xuthus' self, whose WorthHe doth acknowledge great, he views with PainUpon th' Athenian Throne.ALETES.I know him well;'Tis Phorbas. Do not wonder at my Words,But find a Means that I may see the QueenIn secret, unobserv'd by prying Eyes,And all that old Man's Fears, and Rage shall vanish.He shall with Joy receive a Stranger King.Wilt thou devise the Means?PYTHIA.I now beginTo hope indeed. There is some Secret hidOf most important Weight. But does the Queen—ALETES.I will not answer thee; my Time's too precious.Only devise some Means that I may see herQuite unobserv'd by all.PYTHIA.You cannot see herTill all be past. Will that suffice?ALETES.It will.PYTHIA.Here in the Laurel Grove.ALETES.No Place more fit.But O be careful, Pythia, that the KingObserve us not; for 'tis of mighty MomentHe should believe this substituted YouthOf Race Aeolian. To which End, my Pythia,I have among the Priests these few Days past,When they suspected not th' Approach of Xuthus,Dropp'd doubtful Hints as if I had discover'dSome antique Marks amid the Osier TwigsWhich form'd Ilyssus' Cradle, that denoteHe sprang from Aeolus: And at the CaveOf great Trophonius have I ta'en due CareSuch Answers should be given as would induceOne of less Faith than Xuthus to expectAn Heir of his own Family.PYTHIA.The Boy,Knows he of thy Intentions?ALETES.No, nor mustTill ripening Time permit. His Fate dependsUpon his Ignorance.—Soft, who comes here?PYTHIA.It is the warm old Man, and, as I think,Some fair Attendant of the Queen. Retire.I would know more, but—Wherefore do'st thou gazeSo ardently upon them?ALETES.Hence, away,We must not now be seen.Exeunt Pythia and Aletes.Enter LYCEA and PHORBAS.LYCEA.This Place seems quite retir'd. Here if thou waitI will inform the Queen, and her ImpatienceWill bring her on the Instant. Surely, Phorbas,Something mysterious lurks beneath her Tears;Her strange Anxieties. Since thou wer't absentThis unknown Youth alone has fill'd her Thoughts,Of him alone she talks, recounts his Words,Describes his Looks, his Gestures; loves to dwellOn each Particular. Ere thou wer't goneShe wish'd and even expected thy Return;Dispatch'd me often, tho' she knew 'twas vain,To watch for thy Arrival. When the KingApproach'd, she smooth'd her Brow, as if to hideThe Strugglings of her Mind; nay seem'd afraidHe should suspect her Sorrows.PHORBAS.Then to himShe mention'd not this Youth?LYCEA.Her Conduct thereWas most mysterious. With a Voice of Fear,She slightly dropp'd that she had seen a YouthWhom she could wish to bear with her to Athens.The King consented, and with Smiles propos'dThey should adopt him.PHORBAS.Ha! adopt him, said'st thou?LYCEA.In Sport he spake, but at his Words a GlowOf sudden Joy spread o'er her Face, her TongueForgot Restraint, and in his Praise grew lavish:Then stopp'd again, and hesitating stroveTo check its Zeal, as fearful to betraySome hidden Transport.PHORBAS.Whatsoe'er it be,I soon shall damp her Joy. This Youth, Lycea,Must not to Athens.—But behold, the Queen.LYCEA.O how impatient! ere I could returnTo tell her thou wer't here, she comes herself,Eager to learn thy Tidings.Enter CREUSA.CREUSA.Now, my Phorbas,Say what thou know'st at once. The King alreadyConsents he should attend us.PHORBAS.Never, neverShall Athens see that Youth.CREUSA:What mean'st thou, Phorbas?PHORBAS.Too much already of Aeolian BloodHas hapless Athens known.CREUSA.Aeolian Blood!PHORBAS.The King consents! I doubt not his Consent.—Yes, 'twas my Word, great Queen, Aeolian Blood;This Youth descends from Aeolus.CREUSA.Be dumb,Or bring me better Tidings.PHORBAS,Worse I cannot,But what I speak is Truth.CREUSA.Peace, Monster, Peace!Thou know'st not Truth. 'Tis thy affected ZealFor Athens, for thy Country, that suggestsThis horrid Falshood; 'tis thy Hate of Xuthus.PHORBAS.What means my Queen? or how have I deserv'dSuch harsh Expressions? Does my honest LoveFor Athens, and Creusa, subject meTo such unkind Suspicions?CREUSA.Gracious Gods!It cannot be.—Alas, forgive me, Phorbas,I know not what I say, thy Words strike thro' me,They pierce my very Soul. O I had hop'd—But tell me all, tho' I believe thee honest,Thy Zeal for Athens, and for me, may make theeToo hasty of Belief. Why art thou silent?PHORBAS.Amazement stops my Tongue, these Starts of Passion,This Violence of Grief, must have a Cause.CREUSA.Perhaps they have, perhaps to thee, good Phorbas,This bursting Heart may open all its Sorrows.But tell me first, what are thy Proofs? from whenceGain'dst thou this curs'd Intelligence?PHORBAS.O Queen,Thy Looks, thy Words—I know not how to answer.Yet if there be Offence in what I speak,My Ignorance offends, not I offend.Know then, Creusa, from the Priests who 'tendThis Delphic Shrine, by your Command I learntMy first Intelligence.CREUSA.And did they sayThis Youth was of Aeolian Race?PHORBAS.They did.At least their Words imported little less.They judg'd me Xuthus' Friend, not Enemy,As would thy Rage suggest, and as a FriendDropp'd Hints they thought would please me.CREUSA.Then, perhaps,It was not Truth they spake, they but deceiv'dThy Ear with well-judg'd Flattery.PHORBAS.What follow'dConfirm'd it Truth. Has the King mention'd to theeWhat Promises were given him at the ShrineOf sage Trophonius?CREUSA.General PromisesOf sure Success, no more.PHORBAS.Know then, great Queen,As I return'd from Converse with the Priests,I met his Friend and Bosom Fav'rite Lycon.Joy sparkled in his Eyes, and his vain TongueO'erflow'd with Transport. I observ'd it well,And gave the Torrent Passage, nay with ArtEv'n led it blindly forward. Till at lengthHe open'd his whole Soul, and under SealOf firmest Secrecy told me the KingWould find an Heir at Delphi, such an HeirAs would rejoice the unapparent ShadesOf his great Ancestors. At that I started.He found his Error then, and told me, glozing,That great Trophonius had almost proclaim'd,Tho' not expressly, Xuthus here should findAn Heir of his own Race.CREUSA.Of his own Race?PHORBAS.So said he; whether great Trophonius spakeThis Oracle, I know not; but I knowToo well whose Oracle to me declar'd it.CREUSA.Think'st thou this Youth—PHORBAS.Grant it were only doneTo try my Zeal, why should they try it now,Unless some close Design requir'd that Trial?Yes, mighty Queen, I do believe this YouthIs our intended King. But, by yon Heaven,If it be he, or any other HeOf Xuthus' Race, he shall not reign in Athens.This Poinard first shall drink his Blood.CREUSA.Forbear!That Thought distracts me.—Tho' perhaps 'tis just.—O Phorbas, 'twas my Hope, my Wish, my PrayerThat Youth might reign in Athens. But thy WordsStrike deadly Damps like baleful Aconite,And poison all within.PHORBAS.What means my Queen?CREUSA.O Phorbas, O Lycea—but first swearBy Nemesis and the tremendous PowersWho punish broken Faith, no Word, no HintShall'scape your Lips of all your Queen declares.BOTH.We swear!CREUSA.Know then, O Pain to Memory!I had a Son.PHORBAS.A Son!LYCEA.Good Heaven!PHORBAS.A Son!CREUSA.O my full Heart! Thy Mother, my Lycea,Knew all the fatal Process of my Woes,And was their only Solace. Phorbas, yes,I had a Son, but witness every GodWhose genial Power presides o'er nuptial Leagues,Nicander was my wedded Lord. That Night,That fatal Night which drove him forth from Athens,Forc'd from my swelling Womb, ere yet mature,Its precious Burthen. To thy Mother's CaresI ow'd my Life. In secret she assuag'dMy piercing Pangs, and to Nicander's ArmsIn secret she convey'd the wretched Infant.What follow'd well thou know'st. Nicander fell,And with him doubtless fell the dear, dear Charge,Consign'd to his Protection. Yet, good Phorbas,When I beheld this Youth, his Looks, his Voice,His Age, his unknown Birth, all, all conspir'dTo cheat me into Hopes. Alas, how fallen!How blasted all!PHORBAS.Great Queen, my Tears confess,An old Man's Tears, which rarely fall, confessHow much I share your Anguish. Had I knownNicander was your Lord, by Earth and Heaven,I would have rais'd all Athens in his Cause,;Nay, been a Rebel to the best of Masters,Ere the dear Pledge of your unspotted LovesShould thus have fallen untimely. Now, alas,I have not ev'n one flattering Hope to give thee.Till now I oft have wonder'd why so farTheir Rage pursued Nicander. 'Tis too plain,They knew the precious Burthen which he bore,And for the hapless Child the Father died.CREUSA.O God! I feel the Truth of what thou utter'st,And my Heart dies within me. O Lycea,Who, who would be a Mother!PHORBAS.Be a Queen,And turn thy Grief to Rage. Shall Aliens sportWith thy Misfortunes? Shall insulting SpoilersSmile o'er the Ruins of thy hapless State,While all the golden Harvest is their own?Shall Xuthus triumph? shall his Race succeed?While thine, I mean not to provoke thy Tears,Thy tender Blossoms are torn rudely offAlmost or ere they bloom.CREUSA.It shall not be,No, ye immortal Powers!— Yet let us waitTill the dire Truth glare on us. One short HourAnd Doubt shall be no more. Then, Phorbas, thenShould he presume to place on Athens' ThroneHis alien Race, nay tho' this beauteous Youth,This dear Resemblance of my murder'd Lord,Should be the fatal Choice, by that dear Shade,Which perish'd as it reach'd the Gates of Life,I will, I think I will, assist thy Vengeance.—Soft, who comes here? 'Tis he! how innocent!How winning soft he looks! Whate'er it be,He knows not the Deceit. Look on him, Phorbas;Nay, thou shalt question him.PHORBAS.Not I. Great Queen,Resume yourself, nor let this fond PersuasionBetray you to a Weakness you should blush at.CREUSA.If possible I will.Enter ILYSSUS.ILYSSUS.Illustrious Queen,The Altar stands prepar'd, and all Things waitYour Royal Presence: From the King I come,His Messenger.CREUSA.We will attend his Pleasure.Be near me, Phorbas; I may want thy Counsel.ILYSSUS.She looks not on me sure as she was wont.I'll speak to her. Permit me, gracious Queen,To pay my humblest Thanks, for by your meansThe King is kind as you are.CREUSA.Rise, Ilyssus.Perhaps you needed there no Advocate.Phorbas, lead on. My Resolution melts,And all my Sex returns. One Look from himOutweighs a thousand Proofs. Phorbas, lead on,Or I am lost in Weakness.Exeunt Creusa and Phorbas.ILYSSUS,stopping Lycea.Gentle Maid,Stay yet a Moment. Wherefore does the QueenLook coldly on me? Know'st thou if in oughtI have offended?LYCEA.Things of mightiest ImportAt present fill her Mind, nor leave they roomFor less Affairs. My Duty calls me hence.Exit.ILYSSUS.I hope it is no more; yet each AppearanceAlarms me now. Aletes, thou hast rais'dSuch Conflicts here, such Hopes, such Fears, such Doubts,That Apprehension sinks beneath their Weight.Well might'st thou say these solitary ShadesHave now no Peace for me. Yet once thou taught'st me,That the pure Mind was its own Source of Peace.But that Philosophy I find belongsTo private Life, for where Ambition entersI feel it is not true.Exit.The End of the Second ACT.ACT III. The Vestibule of the Temple.ALETES alone.WHY should I doubt? it will, it must succeed.Yet I could wish that I had seen CreusaBefore 'twas undertaken, for perhaps—'Tis better as it is. Her Part had thenBeen difficult to act; now what she does,Assisting or opposing the Design,Will all seem natural.—The Pythia sureWill act as I directed.—Hark, the RitesShould be ere this perform'd; why stay they then?—That Noise proclaims them finish'd, and the CroudWill soon be here.—They come, I must not yetBe seen; the Pythia in the Laurel GroveMay tell me what has pass'd.Exit.CREUSA descends hastily from the Temple in great Disorder, LYCEA following.LYCEA.Stay, mighty Queen,You know not what you do; your Rage transports you;You leave the Rites unfinish'd, and the CroudIn wild Amazement gaze on your Departure.CREUSA.I will not stay, nor will I tamely bearMy disappointed Hopes. O honest Phorbas,O good old Man, thy penetrating MindSaw early their Designs. 'Tis to supplyNicander's Loss (O ne'er to be supply'd!)That we must call in Strangers to the Throne,And yield our Scepters to Aeolian Hands.—Yes, ye great Shades of my Progenitors,I hear ye call, ye shall, ye shall have Vengeance!LYCEA.Whatever you design, conceal at leastThis Transport of your Rage.CREUSA.Why loiters Phorbas?He saw my Anguish, wherefore comes he notTo its Relief? They fool me past Endurance.Rely they on the Weakness of my Sex?Lycea, they shall find this feeble ArmIn such a Cause can lay the Distaff by,And grasp th' unerring Thunderbolt of Jove.O Phorbas, art thou come?Enter PHORBAS from the Temple.PHORBAS.Now, mighty Queen,Are my Suspicions just? is Phorbas honest?CREUSA.As Light, as Truth itself. My Counsellor,My Bosom Friend!PHORBAS.Now shall a casual Likeness,If such there be, a semblant Cast of Features,The Sport of Nature in a human Form,Shall Trisles light as these weigh down Conviction?O Queen, from first to last th' apparent SchemeGlares on us now. Why were we brought to Delphi,But that this Youth has long been nurtur'd hereIn secret from the World; perhaps the SonOf Xuthus' self, plac'd here at first to hideThe Guilt and Shame of some dishonest Mother,Tho' now applied to more pernicious Ends.CREUSA.It may be so.PHORBAS.And why, say why, to-day,While Xuthus stays behind for OraclesHe wanted not, is young Ilyssus bidTo meet your Eyes, and win with artful TalesYour easy Heart?CREUSA.Bid! was he bid to do it?PHORBAS.I saw the Priestess whisper something to him,Then loud she bade him wait for thy Approach.She must, forsooth, retire to sacred Glooms,And wait for Inspiration. Xuthus' GoldWas what inspir'd the Traitress. Yet, good Heaven,When from the Shrine she gave the fraudful Words,With what strange Art the holy HypocriteIn mimic Trances died!—"A banish'd Youth"Is Athens' Cause of Woe." Too truly said,Tho' for a wicked Purpose, to allureThy easy Faith, and lead thee to admitThe Fraud which follow'd.CREUSA.Never, never, Phorbas,Will I that Fraud admit. How readilyDid Xuthus, when my foolish Fondness ask'd it,Consent to my Request!To Lycoa. Thou heard'st him sayWe should adopt this Youth; in seeming SportHe spake it, but ev'n then th' insulting TyrantCouch'd fatal Truths beneath th' ambiguous Phrase.PHORBAS.Why should a Youth design'd for SolitudeBe taught the Arts of War? He saw himselfThe Impropriety. Who is this SageThat has instructed him? And why should LyconO'erflow with sudden Joy, but that he found,From thy apparent Fondness for the Boy,Their Schemes grew practicable. Nay, to-day,When to the Priestess' self my honest LoveFor Athens, and Dislike of Stranger Kings,Burst freely forth, she chid my hasty Zeal,Commended Xuthus, talk'd of PietyAnd Rev'rence to the Gods: 'Twas to their PriestsShe meant, their meddling Priests, who dare presumeTo sport with Thrones, to sell their Gods for Gold,And stamp rank Falshoods with the Seal of Heaven.LYCEA.Forbear, you are too loud so near the Temple;Xuthus himself will hear.CREUSA.We would be heard.Instruct me, Phorbas, by what means to crushThis impious Combination.PHORBAS.Athens yetHas honest Hearts. Yes, Phorbas yet has FriendsWho dare be Patriots, and prefer their CountryTo Xuthus' kindest Smile. Some such are hereEv'n now at Delphi. But, illustrious Queen,We must with Caution act. The Name of Heaven,Howe'er usurp'd, adds Vigour to their Cause,And weakens ours. We might in secret findA sure Revenge.CREUSA.What?PHORBAS.Death.CREUSA.Of Xuthus?PHORBAS.HisMight follow, but the more immediate CauseShould earliest be remov'd, the Boy.CREUSA.The Boy!Why should he die? Believe me, honest Phorbas,He knows not of the Fraud. His every LookProclaims his Innocence. If impious MenMake him their Instrument of evil Deeds,Can he be blam'd? Bred up in Shades, poor Youth,He never knew the Arts of base Mankind,Nor should he share their Punishment.PHORBAS.O Queen,They have too well succeeded. This fond Passion,Which their insidious Cunning first inspir'd,Clings close about your Heart, and may at lastUndo us all.—But hark, that Noise declaresThe finish'd Rites. Retire we to the Grove,And there will I enforce—CREUSA.No, let us stay.I will confront this artful Politician,And shew him I am yet a Queen.PHORBAS.Perhaps'Twere better to retire till our full SchemeWere ripe for Vengeance.—
* Aside. Yet if we remain,High Words must rise, which will alarm her PrideAnd fit her for my Purpose.Enter XUTHUS, ILYSSUS, Priests, Virgins, Guards, &c. from the Temple.XUTHUS, (coming up to Creusa)Thy Looks, Creusa, thy abrupt DepartureAffronting to the God himself, and theseHis sacred Ministers, too plainly shewIrreverent Rage, resisting Heaven's high Will.Nor do'st thou want I see, unthinking Woman,Inflamers of thy Folly.—But of thisEnough; behold the Youth whom Heaven designsThy Heir, and mine.CREUSA.My Heir!XUTHUS.Thy Heir, Creusa.What means that haughty Look? Why with ContemptDo'st thou behold him? Is he chang'd, Creusa?Have a few Hours so totally transform'd him?Is all that winning Grace of which thou spak'stAlmost with Rapture, is that native CharmOf Innocence all vanish'd? Hear him speak,Hear if he talks less sensibly than whenThy pleas'd Attention hung upon his Words,And lent each Syllable an added Grace.What hast thou found, or thy grave MonitorWhat has he found, which can so suddenlyHave wrought this wond'rous Change? Is it becauseThe Gods have thought with thee that he deservesA Crown? or is it that my Will consents?And therefore thine, proud Queen, perversely strivesTo combat thy Affections?CREUSA.We methinksHave chang'd Affections. The calm, steady Xuthus,Whose equal Mind ne'er knew the stormy GustsOf discomposing Passion, now can feelIndecent Warmth when touch'd by pious Zeal.Nay he, to whom the tend'rer SentimentsSeem'd but the Weakness of the human Frame,Now wakes inspir'd with some unusual Softness.Have Oracles the Power to raise at onceThe kind Affections? or did he concealThe smother'd Flame, 'till authoris'd by HeavenIt might burst out unquestion'd?XUTHUS.Haughty Queen,I understand thee well; thou think'st this YouthA Substitute of mine, and dar'st affrontYon awful Shrine, the Fountain of pure Truth.But by that God who bears the vengeful Bow,And whose large Eye—Yet wherefore should I striveBy Oaths to undeceive thee; Breasts like mineCan scorn th' imputed Falshood they detest.Nor am I now to learn from what vile SourceThy vain Suspicions rise. But know, proud Queen,This Youth shall reign in Athens; and yet moreTo punish thy vain Pride, since thou provok'st it,I do believe him of Aeolian Race.CREUSA.Thou do'st?XUTHUS.I do. A Race as glorious, Queen,As Cecrops' boasted lineage. For the Youth,Were I to beg the choicest Boon of HeavenFrom my own Loins to rise, I could not hopeA nobler Offspring.PHORBAS.Aside to Creusa.Hear'st thou that?CREUSA.I do,And will revenge the Insult.ILYSSUS.Kneeling.Gracious Queen!What have I done which should estrange thee to me?Am I the unhappy Cause of these Dissentions?CREUSA.Kneel not to me, Ilyssus.XUTHUS.Kneel not to her;'Tis I am thy Protector, and thy Friend,Nay now thy Father.ILYSSUS.Yet, O mighty King,Permit me at her Royal Feet to payMy humblest Duty. If I call thee Father,She sure must be a Mother.She turns away disorder'd.XUTHUS.Rise, Ilyssus,Thou seest she stands unmov'd.ILYSSUS.No, now she softens,I see it in her Eyes.CREUSA.I will, I willBe Mistress of my Soul.—Why kneel'st thou, Youth,I blame not thee.XUTHUS.Men then thou blam'st, Creusa.I am the Object of thy Rage. 'Tis XuthusThou think'st unworthy of th' Athenian Throne.CREUSA.Athens might well have spar'd a foreign Lustre,Secure of Fame, had Xuthus ne'er been born.XUTHUS.Ungrateful Queen, had Xuthus ne'er been bornWhat now had Athens been?CREUSA.Perhaps in Ruins,And better so than to become the PreyOf needy wand'ring Strangers.XUTHUS.Earth, and Heaven!This the Return?—I knew thou never loved'st me,Yet, witness Heav'n, I ravish'd not thy Hand,Thou gav'dst it sullenly, but yet thou gav'dst it;And I well hop'd thy Female Sense of Honour,Of Duty to thy Lord, might have secur'dAt least my future Peace. Thy tend'rer Thoughts,The Wife's best Ornament, I knew were buriedIn a Plebeian Grave.CREUSA.Plebeian Grave?XUTHUS.Fool that I was, I flatter'd thy vain Sorrows,Indulg'd their weak Excess, and rais'd, I find,Imaginary Rivals in the Tomb.But never more, Creusa, never moreShalt thou affront my ill-requited Fondness.I will destroy that Pageant of thy Passion,Tear from that Idol Shrine th'insulting Wreaths,And cancel thy mock Worship.ILYSSUS.Gracious Queen,Retire a while.CREUSA.Be gone.—Insulting Tyrant,Touch but a Wreath that's sacred to Nicander,And by pale Hecate's awful Rites I swearThy Life shall pay the Forfeit; nay the LivesOf thy whole dastard Race.—Plebeian Grave!Had that Plebeian liv'd, Imperial XuthusHad crouch'd beneath his Feet.XUTHUS.O would to HeavenThis scepter'd Arm could raise him from the Earth,That thou might'st see how infamous a SlaveThou dar'st prefer to Xuthus.—Come, Ilyssus,We leave her to her Follies. Look not on her,She merits not thy Tenderness. Away.If Reason should again resume its SeatWe may expect her at the Banquet. Come,All here must be our Guests.Exeunt Xuthus, Ilyssus, &c.Creusa, Phorbas, and Lycea stay.PHORBAS.Curb not thy Passion, give it Vent, great Queen,And let it burst in Thunder on thy Foes.CREUSA.It shall, by Heaven it shall.—I thought till nowMy Griefs were sacred, but this Monster daresInsult even Misery itself.—O Phorbas,Forgive me if my Tears will force a Passage.—Now, they are gone, and I will weep no more.Come, faithful Counsellor of Vengeance, come,Instruct me how to act, steel all my Soul;Let not Remorse or Pity's Coward Voice,The Bane of noble Deeds, intrude to cross us.Nicander's injur'd Ghost shall aid our Counsels.Say, shall he die?PHORBAS.Not yet, first be his SchemesAbortive all, his politic Designs,Then let him die despis'd.CREUSA.Agreed; but how?PHORBAS.Now at the Banquet may we crush at onceHis full blown hopes. The fatal Cause remov'd,Th' Effect of course must cease.CREUSA.What Cause?PHORBAS.The Boy.I see thou shudder'st at it: but, great Queen,Hear but the cogent Reasons I shall offerAnd thou wilt think as I do. For the BoyHeav'n knows I wish to spare him, but no MeansNo earthly Means but this can curse compleatlyThis politic Designer. Doubtless longThis fav'rite Scheme to place on Athens' ThroneHis hated Race, has labour'd in his Breast,And all his Hours employ'd. On this aloneHe builds the firm Foundation of his Peace,His Happiness to come. His Death were nothing,He knows his Friends, the Minions of his Fortune,He knows all Greece, such is their Dread and AweOf Delphi's Shrine, will join in the SupportOf this deceitful Claim; and that firm HopeWill make him triumph ev'n in Death, and laughAt our too shallow Vengeance.CREUSA.Laugh he shall not.No, I will punish home.PHORBAS.You cannot punishBy any Means but this. And know, great Queen,I have a Poison of such subtile Force,(Why do'st thou start?) of such amazing Strength,Yet so peculiar in its Operation,That it shall seem the Surfeit of the Feast,Not we have done the Deed. At least shall seem soTo all but Xuthus' self; for he methinksShould know the Truth, at least suspect it strongly,And yet not dare Revenge.CREUSA.I cannot bear it;Howe'er we fail in our Revenge; my Phorbas,The Boy must live.PHORBAS.Good Heav'n! is this Creusa?Is this the vengeful Queen who would not hearRemorse or Pity's Voice?—Farewel then Athens;Yes, my poor Country, thou must sink enslav'dTo foreign Tyrants. She who should defendThy Rights, thy Liberties, stands tamely byAnd sees the Yoke impos'd, nay smiles to see it:Thy Queen, the last of her illustrious Line,Consents to thy Destruction.CREUSA.Never, Phorbas.Do what thou wilt. With this last parting PangI give him to thy Rage.—Yet oh, bewareI see him not again. One Look from himWould baffle all thy Schemes.PHORBAS.Now at the BanquetWill we infuse the Draught, ev'n in the CupWhich the King's self presents to his young HeirIn Token of Election.CREUSA.Stay, good Phorbas.PHORBAS.Already have I for the just DesignSuborn'd a faithful Slave. Nay, should it fail,I have a trusty Band, a chosen few,Athenian Souls who scorn to bow the KneeTo any foreign Lord; these will I placeAt the Pavilion Doors, if need require,To second our Attempt.CREUSA.Yet stay, good Pherbas.How kindly did he seem to sympathizeWith my Distress! nay almost chid the King,When his loud Rage—PHORBAS.He had been taught his Lesson.'Twas all Design, all Artifice to workUpon a Woman's Weakness.CREUSA.Think'st thou so?PHORBAS.I do. But, O my Queen, be more than Woman,Conquer this Foible of thy Sex.CREUSA.Heav'n knowsHow much it costs to do it.—Go then, Phorbas,I cannot bid thee prosper.Exit Phorbas.O Lycea,Thou know'st not what I feel.—Haste, call him back.—No, stay—I think the Bitterness is past,And I can bear it now. Lend me thy Arm,I would retire, Lycea.—Yet from whatShould I retire? I cannot from myself!—O Boy, thou art reveng'd; whate'er thou suffer'stIs light, to what thy Murd'ress feels!Exeunt.The End of the Third ACT.ACT IV. The Laurel Grove.PHORBAS and Athenians.PHORBAS.THIS Way, my Friends; at the Pavilion DoorsStand ready arm'd, that if we need your AidYou may observe the Sign, and crush at onceThese vile Usurpers on the Rights of Athens.I hope we want ye not.—I must be hidA while, lest Xuthus should suspect my Presence.The Queen too may repent, I'll therefore shun her Aside.Till the Deed's done, irrevocably done. Aside.—But stir not till I come.—What Noise is that?Retire, my Friends, the Temple's Postern DoorGrates on its Hinge.—Be secret, and we prosper.Exeunt severally.Enter ALETES and PYTHIA.ALETES.This Quarrel was unlucky. A slight BreachHad lent my Purpose Strength; but wrought thus highIt may defeat our Hopes. She cannot nowWith Ease recede from her too rash Resolves,At least not unsuspected. Did she, say'st thou,Reject thy Message?PYTHIA.Scarcely did she payThe decent Dues my sacred Office claims.And when I prest her more, with sullen PrideShe silently withdrew.ALETES.See her I must.Where went she?PYTHIA.To the Shades which over-hangTh' Aonian Fount.ALETES.I will pursue her thither.PYTHIA.It may not be, for now I know thy Secret'Tis my turn to be prudent, Know'st thou notThou should'st be cautious, nor expose thyselfTo prying Eyes? I heard her, as she pass'd,In broken Whispers bid Lycea hasteTo Phorbas, and inform that trusty FriendThat she would wait him in the Laurel Grove.Here then thou may'st surprise them both, and crownAt once thy whole Design.ALETES.Thou counsell'st well,And I will guide me by thy kind Advice.O Pythia, how did every thing conspireTo give me hopes that I should place the BoySecure on Athens' Throne, unknown to allBut those whom Fate had made his firmest Friends.The very Means I us'd to make it sureHave been most adverse to the Cause I labour'd.Had I relied on Xuthus' Piety,Nor mention'd Aeolus, Success were mine.And let me hope it still. What most I fearIs the Queen's Warmth of Passion. To which endI must proceed with Tenderness, and hideFor some short time Ilyssus from her Knowledge.I have unnumber'd Cautions to premiseWhich her o'erflowing Joy may haply ruin.The Banquet, is it ready?PYTHIA.It has longIn vain expected its illustrious Guests.The King already has forgot his Rage,And hopes returning Thought may move the QueenTo equal Amity: He therefore findsContinual Causes to delay the Feast.ALETES.Retire. Perhaps 'tis she; I hear the StepsOf some who move this way.Exit Pythia.What means he here?Why art thou absent from the Banquet, Youth?Enter ILYSSUS.ILYSSUS.It has no Joys for me. I fear, Aletes,Thou and the Pythia have most foully play'dFor my Advancement.ALETES.Ha!ILYSSUS.Where are the ParentsWhom thou didst promise to my Hopes? AlasI find no Parents here, no kind Regards,No inexpressive Fondness. Stern Debate,And foul Dissention kindle here their TorchTo usher in my Greatness. Ev'n Creusa,Whose Tenderness I know not how alarm'dMy throbbing Heart with Hopes, and Doubts, and Fears,Unfelt before, ev'n she has taught her EyesTo look with Strangeness on me. The good King,Who yet withdraws not his Protection from me,Seems lost in anxious Thought.—Unkind Aletes,Art thou the Cause of this? Say, am I sprungOf Race Aeolian? For by Heaven I swear,By that pure Fountain of immortal Truth;I will not brook Deceit. I will again,Howe'er the glitt'ring Mischief tempt my Youth,Become that humble unknown Thing I was,Rather than wear a Crown by Falshood gain'd.Speak then, and give me Ease.ALETES.My dearest Boy—His Virtue charms me, tho' it may prevent Aside.His own Success. O happy, happy Athens, Aside.To gain a King like him, whose honest Soul Aside.Starts at imagin'd Fraud! Aside.ILYSSUS.Speak on, Aletes,And do not by that Look of Tenderness,And murm'ring to thyself, alarm me more.ALETES.What should I speak? This very Morn, Ilyssus,This very Morn I told thee a few HoursWould shew thee what thou wert; but thy ImpatienceBrooks not that short Delay. It seems AletesHas lost his usual Credit with Ilyssus,Ev'n with the Youth his anxious Care has form'd.Think'st thou the Man who taught thy feeling HeartTo start at Falshood, would himself commitThe Fraud thou shudder'st at? What have I done,Which should induce thee to a Thought so base?Did e'er my Precepts contradict my Heart?Did I e'er teach a Virtue I not practis'd?—I see thou art confounded. Know then, Youth,I blame not thy Impatience, nay I praiseThat Modesty which can so soon resumeIts Seat, when all things round are big with Wonder.Ere Night thou shalt know all; till then, Ilyssus,Behave as Athens' King.ILYSSUS.O good Aletes,Forgive my Rashness. Yes, I know thee honestAs Truth itself, and know the wond'rous DebtI owe thy Goodness. Yet, if thou confessThat I have Reason for these anxious Cares,Thou wilt permit me still to question thee.Nay look upon me whilst I speak to thee.Perhaps thou hast some secret Cause, Aletes,For all that kind Attention thou hast shewn me,From Infancy till now? Why do'st thou turnThy Eyes to Earth? 'Tis plain thou hast a Cause:Thou know'st from whom I spring; how can'st thou elseWith Confidence assert, that yet ere NightI shall know all?—Say this at least, Aletes,Shall the Queen's Anger cease?ALETES.It shall, Ilyssus.Ev'n now I wait her here; on what DesignI must not yet inform thee. The next TimeThou shalt behold her thou wilt find a ChangeIncredible indeed, from Rage to Fondness,From cold Reserve to Tears of bursting Joy.Ilyssus is going to speak eagerly.—Ask me no more.—Yet something didst thou sayRelating to the Cause which fix'd me hereThy Guardian, thy Instructor, and—the TimeWill come, when thou shalt know it all, Ilyssus,And bless my Memory.ILYSSUS.Thou weep'st, Aletes.My Tears will mingle too.ALETES.Forbear, and leave me.Yet stay a while, for now perhaps we partTo meet no more.ILYSSUS.No more! Thou wilt not leave meWhen most I want thy Care! 'Twas my first Thought,'Twas the first Boon I ask'd of the good King,That thou might'st be my kind Instructor still.He prais'd my Gratitude, and I had promis'dTo bring him to thy Cottage. He himselfShall be a Suitor to thee.ALETES.Thou hast ask'dThou know'st not what: It cannot be, Ilyssus,That Xuthus and Aletes e'er should meetOn terms of Amity. The Smiles of GreatnessTo me have lost their Value. For thy LoveI could do much, and to be sever'd from theePulls at my Heart-strings. But resistless FateHas fix'd its Seal, and we must part for ever,How hard soe'er it seem. Thy Youth will soon,Amidst the busy Scenes of active Greatness,Forget its Monitor: But I must bearIn hopeless Solitude the Pangs of AbsenceTill Thought shall be no more.ILYSSUS.O heav'nly PowersThen there is something dreadful yet conceal'd.I cannot part from thee in Ignorance.Tell me, Aletes.ALETES.Would I could! But nowIt must not be.—Haste to the Banquet, Youth,Thy Duty calls thee thither.ILYSSUS.Go I cannot,Till thou assur'st me we shall meet again.ALETES.If possible we will. If not, remember,When thou shalt know thyself, that on thyselfThy Fate depends; that Virtue, Glory, Happiness,Are close connected, and their sad ReverseIs Vice, is Pain, is Infamy.—Alas!These were the Lessons of thy private Life,This I have told thee oft, but my fond TongueRuns o'er its former Precepts, and forgetsThou now must mount a Throne; a larger SceneOf Duty opens.ILYSSUS.Yet the tender Friend,Who should direct me, leaves me to myself.Can'st thou abandon me?ALETES.Would Fate permitI would attend thee still. But oh, Ilyssus,Whate'er becomes of me, when thou shall reachThat envied Pinacle of earthly Greatness,Where faithful Monitors but rarely follow,Ev'n there, amidst the kindest Smiles of Fortune,Forget not thou wert once distress'd and friendless.Be strictly just; but yet, like Heaven, with MercyTemper thy Justice. From thy purged EarBanish base Flattery, and spurn the WretchWho would persuade thee thou art more than Man;Weak, erring, selfish Man, endued with PowerTo be the Minister of public Good.If Conquest charm thee, and the Pride of WarBlaze on thy Sight, remember thou art placedThe Guardian of Mankind, nor build thy FameOn Rapines, and on Murders. Should soft PeaceInvite to Luxury, the pleasing BaneOf happy Kingdoms, know from thy ExampleThe Bliss or Woe of nameless Millions springs,Their Virtue, or their Vice. Nor think by LawsTo curb licentious Man; those Laws aloneCan bend the headstrong Many to their Yoke,Which make it present Int'rest to obey them.O Boy!—Enter PYTHIA hastily.PYTHIA.Ilyssus! wherefore art thou here?The King expects thee, and the Banquet waits.ILYSSUS.I cannot go.ALETES.Thou must; thy Fate dependsUpon thy Absence now. The Queen approaches.After the Banquet I again will see thee,And thou shalt know the whole. I will by Heaven.Exit Ilyssus.Pythia away, and wait me in the Temple.Exit Pythia.She saw them not; on her contracted BrowSits brooding Care. She speaks! My Heart beats thick,And my Tongue trembles to perform its Office.Now Fate attend, and perfect thine own Work!Enter CREUSA.CREUSA.To what have I consented!—Ha! who art thouThat thus intrud'st on sacred Privacy,When the o'erburthen'd Mind unloads its Griefs,Its hoarded Miseries.ALETES.Thy better Genius!CREUSA.That Voice is sure familiar to my Ear!Who art thou, speak.ALETES.One whom AdversityHas taught to know himself. I bring thee tidingsOf an unhappy Man who wrong'd thee much,But much repented of the Wrongs he did thee;Of thy Nicander, Queen.CREUSA.Nicander, say'st thou?O then thou art indeed my better Genius.ALETES.Now, arm thy Soul for Wonders yet to come!Perhaps he lives.CREUSA.He lives?Looking on him with Amazement.ALETES.After great Irresolution and Struggles with himself.Behold him here!She faints.—What has my Rashness done?—The Blush of LifeHas left her Cheek, the Pulse forgets to move.Where shall I turn? I cannot call for Aid,Nor can I leave her thus.—She breathes, she stirs!—Yes, yes, Creusa, thy Nicander lives,And he will catch at least this dear EmbraceTho' now thou art another's.CREUSA.Gracious Gods!It is, it is Nicander, 'tis my Lord!O I am only thine, no Power on EarthShall e'er divide us more.—It cannot be, my Senses all deceive me—And yet it is.—O let me gaze upon thee,Recall each Trace which marks thee for my own,And gives me back the Image of my Heart.How Time and Grief have chang'd thee! But my LoveCan know no Change. My Lord, my Life, my Husband!Where hast thou wander'd? how hast thou been hidFrom Love's all-piercing Sight? the bloody Ruffians,How didst thou 'scape their Rage? or did they wreakUpon the helpless Innocent aloneTheir impious Vengeance?NICANDER.Nor on me, nor himDid Vengeance fall.CREUSA.Does he too live?NICANDER.He does.CREUSA.Aside.O honest Phorbas! Murder now is Virtue.NICANDER.The fabled Murder was all StratagemContriv'd for thy dear sake; no impious RuffiansPursued our Steps, I found that I had wrong'd theeBeyond redress, nor knew another meansBut by my Death to save thee from Dishonor.Despair I thought might conquer Love, and thouOnce more be Athens' Pride. The precious ChargeForbad a real Death, I therefore stain'dWith Blood my well-known Garments, which produc'd.—CREUSA.A curst'd Effect.—But I have nearer Fears.How cam'st thou hither? wherefore to these Shades?The Boy, where is he?NICANDER.Far from hence—CREUSA.Thank Heaven!NICANDER.He lives in Peace and Safety.—What disturbs thee?CREUSA.Nothing—I dare not tell him what I feared,His honest Breast might shudder at the Guilt,Tho' now it be more needful. — The dear Boy,Say, is he brave?NICANDER.As Woman could desire.CREUSA.And form'd like thee?NICANDER.His Person far exceedsWhat my most vig'rous Youth could boast, Creusa.And his firm Mind is Wisdom's aged StrengthWith all Youth's Graces soften'd.CREUSA.'Tis too much.O happy Mother! Call'st thou him Nicander?NICANDER.No, Ion, 'twas the Name the Matron chose,Who gave him to my Care.CREUSA.Then Ion be it.Ion shall reign in Athens. Know'st thou, Love,The curs'd Design which this Aeolian here,And the vile Maid —NICANDER.The Priestess, it should seem,With Xuthus has conspir'd to fix his RaceOn Athens' Throne.CREUSA.But never shall his RaceThat Scepter wield.NICANDER.It never shall, Creusa.I have a Means —CREUSA.Aside.My Means, thank Heaven, is surer.NICANDER.But I will tell thee all from first to last.Hear then and weigh my Words, for Fate is in them.Xuthus, th' Athenian King—CREUSA.I think not of him.NICANDER.Beware of that. Whate'er thou think'st, Creusa,Xuthus must still reign on, thy Lord and Husband.CREUSA.Xuthus my Lord! then what art thou, Nicander?Do'st thou despise me for a Crime thyselfHast forc'd me to commit? My Soul was thineEv'n when I gave my Hand, and still remainsUntainted, undefil'd.NICANDER.I know it well,Thou dearest, best of Women.—My torn HeartDrops Blood while I propose it, yet we must,We must for ever part.—Forbear, Creusa,That killing Look strikes thro' me.—Think, O think,What in this Age of Absence I have borne,How combated each tender Thought, and liv'dFor thy dear Sake a Victim to Despair.But now if thou consent'st, all, all is mine,And I forgive my Fate.—The dear, dear Boy,I have a Means to place him on the ThroneSecure as we could wish.CREUSA.Secure he shall be,I will proclaim him to the World as mine,And Athens shall with Joy receive its Sov'reign;The Tyrant Xuthus shall be taught to fearA Master's Frown.NICANDER.Thy Rashness, my Creusa,May ruin all.CREUSA.I will be rash, if thisBe Rashness, to declare to Earth, to Heav'n,A Mother's Heart-felt Joy, whose only ChildSnatch'd from the Grave unhop'd for comes to claim,With every Grace and every Virtue crown'd,Th' Imperial Seat of his great Ancestors.And shall we wait a Means?NICANDER.We need not wait;For by my Care th' important Means is foundAlready, and no human Power but thineCan hinder our Success. I would have hidThe Secret from thee till thy wish'd ConsentHad giv'n my Purpose Strength, but thou defeat'stMy utmost Caution, and wilt force me tell thee,Ilyssus is young Ion!—Ha! Creusa!Thou art not mad! Good Heaven! how her Eye fixes!What have I done? what said, which could attackThe Seats of Sense with this amazing Force?My Wife, my Queen, O speak?—CREUSA.Off, touch me not,Thou can'st not bring Relief.—O I am curs'dBeyond all Power of Aid. Thou too art curs'dAnd know'st it not.—He dies, he dies, Nicander!NICANDER.Amazement! who?CREUSA.O had he not been mine,His Youth, his Softness, each attracting Grace—I should have staid whole Ages ere in ThoughtI had consented to so damn'd a Deed.Tears, Tears, why burst ye not?—But what have ITo do with Tears? those are for tender Mothers.The Tigress weeps not o'er her mangled Prey.—He dies, he dies, Nicander.NICANDER.Who? Ilyssus?Speak, speak, Creusa.CREUSA.Phorbas urg'd the Deed,And I consented; at the Feast he diesBy Poison.—O my Soul!NICANDER.Fly then, this InstantPerhaps thou may'st prevent it, as thou cam'stHe parted hence.—I knew not to his Death!CREUSA.I go, I fly.NICANDER.Yet stay, thy Rashness there,If Fate has sav'd him, may undo us yet.—The Pythia! true, the Pythia shall rush inTo stop the fatal Banquet, and declareThe Feast unhallow'd; at this lucky MomentShe waits me in the Temple.—Stay, Creusa.Exit Nicander.CREUSA.The Pythia, no; I will myself outstripThe Lightning's Speed. Whatever be th' Event,'Tis not too late to die.Exit.The End of the Fourth ACT.ACT V. The Laurel Grove.PHORBAS and LYCEA.LYCEA.O Earth! O Heaven! O wretched, wretched Athens!PHORBAS.Speak on, Lycea; wherefore art thou silent?Why do'st thou lead me to this secret Shade?What mean thy flowing Tears?LYCEA.The Queen, the Queen!PHORBAS.Say, what of her?LYCEA.I know not, all to meIs Terror and Confusion.PHORBAS.What thou know'stRelate.LYCEA.She sent me forth to seek thee, Phorbas;I found thee not, but met at my ReturnCreusa's self. Despair was in her Eyes,With hasty Steps she shot impatie by me,Nor listen'd when I spake. I follow'd wond'ring,And enter'd the Pavilion.PHORBAS.The Pavilion?Why, went she to the Banquet?LYCEA.Eager went,Despair and Anguish mixing on her Look.But, O good Heaven, how chang'd was that DespairTo inexpressive Joy, when from the CroudShe learnt Ilyssus had delay'd the Feast,And won the King once more to ask her Presence,"Where is he? let me clasp him to my Breast,"She cried; "I now no longer will resist"Heaven's high command." Imperial Xuthus roseWith Transport to receive her, and loud ShoutsProclaim'd the People's Joy. When, Death to Sight!Eternal Pain to Memory! the SlavePresents the Goblets; Fill, she cried, a third,I too will hail Ilyssus King of Athens.But first all swear, swear by immortal Jove,By the far-darting God who here presides,And the chaste Guardian of our native Fanes,Swear here, swear all, and binding be the Oath,Ilyssus only shall be Athens' King.PHORBAS.What could she mean?LYCEA.Attentive Xuthus caughtWith Joy the happy Omen, and all sworeIlyssus only should be Athens' King.This done, I saw her from Ilyssus' HandSnatch the dire Goblet, and to him resignHer own untouch'd. The Slave who mix'd the DraughtTurn'd oale and trembled, I with eager ZealPress'd forward, but in vain; she firmly grasp'dThe Bowl, and smiling drank it to the Dregs.PHORBAS.The Poison, ha?—I knew her foolish FondnessWould start at Murder's Name. But wherefore die?Why turn upon herself her impious Rage?'Twas Madness all; or else some new Contrivance,Some fresh Aeolian Fraud.—I care not what.I yet will blast their Schemes.—Yes, let her die,By her own Folly perish. Athens stillSurvives, and shall survive.—I must be sudden.She doubtless will betray me to the King,And cut off ev'n this last Resource. Lycea,Be secret, and thy Country shall be free.LYCEA.Were it not better, Phorbas, first to see her.Perhaps some Secret unreveal'd may lurkBeneath this Show of unexampled Rashness.She left the Banquet soon, and with the PythiaEnter'd the Temple.PHORBAS.With the Pythia, say'st thou?Then there is Mischief toward.LYCEA.Yet now aloneWe may surprize her, for I saw the MaidQuick from the Fane return with hasty StepsAs if dispatch'd on some important Message,Perhaps to find thee out. Sure thou should'st see her.PHORBAS.And perish, ha?—No, no, my sacred Country,Too much already have I been deceiv'd;I will not leave thee in a Woman's Power.—Yet hold, Lycea may inform her of themAnd my Designs prove yet abortive. Maid,Thy Presence may be needful.LYCEA.Mine? Good Heaven,In what? Creusa will require my Aid;At least my Tears are due to my poor QueenIn her last Moments.PHORBAS.Stay, she wants them not;I know the Poison's Force too well, Lycea,To fear a Death so sudden. This Way, Maid;Nay, thou must go; I shall have Business for thee,Some secret Message to the Queen, Lycea,Which thou alone can'st bear.Exeunt.Enter PYTHIA and NICANDER.PYTHIA.'Twas he, I saw him and Lycea with him.Sure he should be inform'd?—Thou hear'st me not.NICANDER.This Action of the Queen sits near my Heart.PYTHIA.She bade me tell thee.—But why waste we Time,Thou now may'st enter at the Postern GateUnseen by all.NICANDER.Why did'st thou not rush in, and stop the Feast?Thy speedy Presence there had sav'd us all.PYTHIA.What could I do? The Queen was there alreadyAnd all seem'd Peace and Joy; could I suspectThat Poison lurk'd beneath so fair a seeming?NICANDER.She breaks thro' my Designs.—Unhappy Woman!My Soul bleeds for her, and Confusion hangsOn every rising Thought.—The dear, dear Boy!—Where is he, at the Banquet still?PYTHIA.He is.NICANDER.And where Creusa?PYTHIA.I already told thee,But thou regard'st not, in the Temple's GloomRetir'd she sits, expecting thy Approach.We there may settle all.NICANDER.I fear her much.Thou seest her Passions are too near concern'dTo be of use to us; thy cooler SenseMust here direct us. Does the Poison's PowerAffect her yet?PYTHIA.Not yet; I would have triedSome powerful Antidote to quell its Force;But she refuses Life, and only begsTo see her Son and thee.NICANDER.I will attendUpon the Instant. But first hear me, Pythia;Thou seest on what a Precipice we stand,It were in vain to hope we could concealThe Truth from Xuthus, from the rest we may;'Tis thy task therefore—PYTHIAS.What? to own the Fraud,And publish to the King that Delphi's ShrineIs not oracular. Ha!NICANDER.To the King'Twere better sure to publish the DeceitThan to the World; and where's the Means but thisTo hide it? By Creusa's Art thou say'stHe is already bound in solemn OathsTo leave Ilyssus Heir to Athens' Throne.Can'st thou not add still stronger Oaths, or ereThou do'st reveal the Secret of our Fate?Then who shall dare to break them? shall the King?Thou know'st his scrup'lous Piety extendsAlmost to Weakness. What should tempt him to it?Creusa dead can frame no Schemes against him;The Boy to him alone must owe his Greatness;And for Nicander, never more shall GreeceHear his forgotten Name.PYTHIA.It must be so;And yet—NICANDER.What yet? to Phorbas thou with easeMay'st own the Truth; he will not start at FraudIn sacred things.—But see, the Queen approachesImpatient of our Stay. She changes not!The Bloom of Health is still upon her Cheek!Fain would I hope—But Hopes, alas, are vain.—What hast thou done, Creusa?CREUSA entering.Sav'd Ilyssus!NICANDER.Thou might'st have liv'd with Honor.CREUSA.Liv'd! good Heaven!I start, I tremble at the Thoughts of Life.Can'st thou reflect on what I had design'd,On what I am, on what, alas, I have been,And not perceive Death was my only Refuge?—Am I not Xuthus' Wife, and what art thou?O had'st thou seen the Torments of my Soul,When in one hasty Moment it ran o'erThe Business of an Age, weigh'd all Events,Saw Xuthus, Thee, Ilyssus, Athens bleedIn one promiscuous Carnage!—Light at lengthBurst thro' the Gloom, and Heaven's own Voice proclaim'dOne Victim might suffice.—For Xuthus Honor strove, and mightier LoveAssum'd Nicander's Cause. Who then could fall?Could Xuthus? could Nicander?—no; Creusa.NICANDER.Would thou had'st been less kind!—But, O my Queen,To blame thee now were vain.—CREUSA.To blame? 'tis Praise,'Tis Triumph I demand. He lives! he reigns!Young Ion lives! young Ion reigns in Athens!O bring him, Pythia, bring him to my Arms;Let me but pour a last sad Blessing o'er him,And Death has lost its Terrors.How now, Lycea?Enter LYCEA hastily.LYCEA.Mighty Queen, I know notIf thy Command would authorize th' Attempt,But Phorbas with an arm'd Athenian BandNow enters the Pavilion to destroyThe King and young Ilyssus.NICANDER.Earth and Heaven!What say'st thou, Maid?CREUSA.O let me fly to save him,Here shall their Poinards—NICANDER.Rest thou there, Creusa,Thy Embaffies to-day have prov'd too fatal.My Life for his I save him from the Stroke,And on the Instant send him to thy Arms.Now, Fate, be doubly mine!Exit.CREUSA.Off, let me go, I will not be restrain'd.They tear him piecemeal!PYTHIA.Patience, mighty Queen!What Man can do Nicander will perform.CREUSA.He is a Father only to my Child,He cannot tell them what a Mother feels.—Phorbas was born the Curse of me and mine.I might have known to what his impious RageWould urge him on, and should have first inform'd him.—Gods! must I never know sweet Peace again,Not even in Death have Rest!PYTHIA.Behold who comesTo bless thee ere thou diest, and cease to murmurAt Heaven's high Will.Enter ILYSSUS.CREUSA.It is, it is Ilyssus—My Son, my Son!ILYSSUS.Good Heavens! and do I liveTo see a Parent melt in Fondness o'er me!—Aletes saved me from the Soldiers' Arms,And bade me fly to find a Mother here.Art thou indeed that Mother, mighty Queen!And may I call thee so? Thou art, thy LooksThy Tears, thy kind Embrace, all, all proclaimThe Truth—O let me thus, thus on my Knees—CREUSA.Rise, rise, my Child; I am, I am thy Mother.ILYSSUS.O sacred Sound, Ilyssus is no moreThat outcast Youth. A Mother, and a QueenHe finds at once.CREUSA.But art thou safe, my Child?Hast thou no Wound?ILYSSUS.The old grey-headed Man,Who brought this Morn the News of thy Arrival,Had rais'd against my Breast his eager Sword,Defenceless I; when good Aletes cameAnd snatch'd me from the Stroke. I would have staid,Unarm'd with him have staid, but his CommandWas absolute, that I should fly to find,What I have found, a Mother!Embracing her.Yet, O Queen,Why am I thus encompass'd round with Wonder?May I not know this Riddle of my Fate?Why first condemn'd to pass my Infant DaysIn this obscure Retreat? If I am thine,Thy Son, illustrious Queen, sure I was bornTo Thrones, and Empires?CREUSA.Thou art born to Thrones,And shalt in Athens reign.ILYSSUS.As Xuthus' Heir.Is Xuthus then my Sire? Forgive me, Queen,I have a thousand, and a thousand Doubts.Can Xuthus be my Sire?PYTHIA.Forbear, Ilyssus,Nor press thy Fate too far. When Time permitsThou shalt know all.CREUSA.Shalt know it now, Ilyssus.Not Xuthus is thy Sire, but that brave ManWho but this Instant snatch'd thee from thy Fate,And by that Act proclaim'd himself a Father.ILYSSUS.Aletes?CREUSA.Not Aletes, but Nicander,My wedded Lord, thy Sire!—And see, he comesTo bless thee, and confirm the sacred Truth.—Good Heaven, he bleeds!Enter NICANDER.NICANDER.To Death, to Death, Creusa.Amid the Fray I met the Fate I sought for.All else is safe, and Xuthus now pursuesA scatter'd Few, who fall beneath his Sword.—Where is my Boy?—Ye Guards of Innocence!How has he been beset, and how escap'd!—Where is my Boy, for I may own him now,And clasp him to my Breast, no more Aletes,The sage Instructor of a Youth unknown,But the dear Father weeping o'er his Child.ILYSSUS.O Sir, what Gratitude before inspir'dLet Duty pay.NICANDER.I have no Time to wasteIn Fondness now. Hear my last Words, Ilyssus,And bind them to thy heart. Thou still must liveThe Son of Xuthus. The good Pythia hereWill tell thee all the Story of thy Fate:And may'st thou prosper as thou do'st obeyHer sacred Counsel. Xuthus too must knowThe fatal Tale; but to the World besideIt must be hid in Darkness.PYTHIA.Phorbas sureShould be inform'd.NICANDER.Phorbas has breath'd his last;And the brib'd Slave who mix'd the poisonous DraughtFell by this Hand.—Ilyssus, O farewel.I will not bid Adieu to thee, Creusa,Thy Colour changes, and the Lamp of LifeFades in thy Eye; we soon shall meet again. —Ilyssus, Oh!—ILYSSUS.How hard he grasps my Hand!My Lord, my Father! Have I learn'd so late,To call thee by that Name, and must I lose,For ever lose?—Good Heaven, she grasps me too!What means it, Pythia? the cold Damps of DeathAre on her.CREUSA.O my Child, enquire no farther;'Tis fitting we should part. Lycea, Pythia,Intreat of Xuthus—yet I need not fearHis Goodness, tho' I wrong'd him, foully wrong'd him,He yet will prove a Father to my Child,And from the World conceal the fatal Truth.O I am cold—what Bolts of Ice shoot thro' me!How my Limbs shiver!—Nearer yet, my Child,My Sight grows dim, and I could wish to gazeFor ever on thee.—Oh, it will not be—Ev'n thou art lost, Ilyssus.—Oh—Farewel.Dies.ILYSSUS.She dies, she dies. Was I then only mock'dWith a vain Dream of Bliss to be plung'd backIn deeper Misery? Did I but hearThe tender Name of Child breath'd fondly o'er meTo make me feel what 'tis to lose that Name?O I am ten times more an Orphan now,Than when I knew no Parents.Enter XUTHUS, &c.XUTHUS.Where is this Murd'ress, who with vile DeceitSeem'd to consent to ours, and Heaven's Designs,Only to make us a more easy PreyTo her Assassins?—Ha, Creusa dead?And the brave Stranger who preserv'd us all?Is he too dead?—The Boy—PYTHIA.Ilyssus lives.And thou hast sworn, great King, that he shall reignSupreme in Athens. Say, do'st thou confirmThat Oath?XUTHUS.I do, by Heaven!PYTHIA.Ask here no more.The fatal Tale is for thy private Ear.Retire, and learn it all. For poor Creusa,She wrong'd not thee, upon herself aloneShe drew Heaven's Vengeance. And too surely provesThat Murder but intentional, not wroughtTo horrid Act, before th' eternal ThroneStands forth the first of Crimes. Who dare assume,Unwarranted, Heaven's high PrerogativeOe'r Life and Death, with double Force shall findTurn'd on themselves the Mischiefs they design'd.The End of the Fifth ACT.EPILOGUE.Spoken by Miss HAUGHTON, who acted the PYTHIA.AT length I'm freed from Tragical Parade,No more a Pythian Priestess,—tho' a Maid;At once resigning, with my sacred Dwelling,My Wreaths, my Wand, my Arts of Fortune-telling.Yet superstitious Folks, no doubt, are here,Who still regard me with a kind of Fear,Lest to their secret Thoughts these prying EyesShould boldly pass, and take them by Surprize.Nay, tho' I disavow the whole Deceit,And fairly own my Science all a Cheat,Should I declare, in spite of Ears and Eyes,The Beaus were handsome, or the Critics wise,They'd all believe it, and with dear DelightSay to themselves at least,"The Girl has Taste;" "the Woman's in the right."Or, should I tell the Ladies, so dispos'd,They'd get good Matches, ere the Season clos'd,They'd smile, perhaps, with seeming Discontent,And, sneering, wonder what the Creature meant;But whisper to their Friends, with beating Heart."Suppose there should be something in her Art"Grave Statesmen too would chuckle, should I say,On such a Motion, and by such a Day,They would be summon'd from their own AffairsTo 'tend the Nation's more important Cares;"Well, if I must—howe'er I dread the Load,"I'll undergo it—for my Country's Good.All Men are Bubbles, in a skilful Hand,The ruling Passion is the Conjurer's Wand.Whether we praise, foretell, persuade, advise,'Tis that alone confirms us Fools or Wise.The Devil without may spread the tempting Sin,But the sure Conqueror is—the Devil within.A SECOND EPILOGUE.Spoken by Mrs. PRITCHARD.STAY, Ladies—Tho' I'am almost tir'd to DeathWith this long Part—and am so out of Breath—Yet such a lucky Thought kind Heaven has sent,That if I die for't, I must give it Vent.The Men you know are gone. And now, suppose,Before our Lords and Masters are rechose,We take th' Advantage of an empty Town,And chuse a House of Commons of our own.What think ye, cannot we make Laws?—and thenCannot we too unmake them, like the Men?O place us once in good St. Stephen's Pews,We'll shew them Women have their public Use.Imprimis they shall marry; not a ManPast twenty-five, but what shall wear the Chain.Next, we'll in earnest set about Reclaming,For, by my Life and Soul, we'll put down Gaming.We'll spoil their deep destructive Midnight Play;The Laws we make, we'll force them to obey;Unless we let them, when their Spirits flag,Piddle with us, ye know, at Quinze and Brag."I hope, my Dearest," says some well-bred Spouse,"When such a Bill shall come before your House,"That you'll consider Men are Men—at least"That you'll not Speak, my Dear."—Not speak?—The Beast!What, would you wound my Honour?—Wrongs like these—For this, Sir, I shall bring you on your Knees.—Or, if we're quite good-natur'd, tell the ManWe'll do him all the Service that we can.Then for ourselves, what Projects, what Designs?We'll tax, and double tax their nasty Wines;But Duty-free import our Blonds and Laces,French Hoops, French Silks, French Cambricks, and—French Faces.In short, my Scheme is not compleated quite,But I may tell ye more another Night.So come again, come all, and let us raiseSuch glorious Trophies to our Country's Praise,That all true Britons shall with one ConsentCry out, "Long live the Female Parliament!THE END.
